Kasamatsu is a great captain - he disciplines freshmen regardless of who they are, teaches that respect is earned over time through hard work and loyalty, and keeps the team spirit up when all odds are against them.
that's why he's my favorite character. Then it's Hyuuga.

This anime gets me way too hyped.
If I ever play basketball I'll just watch an episode of Kuroko's. Of course, I'm still gonna suck, but I'll still make myself feel like a legend.
I started Season 1 of this show last week and now I'm here. Im gonna miss not having to wait for the next episode lol.
Crunchy roll is 2 episodes behind. You can watch 60 and 61 on other sites
I know how you feel. :'(
I was in the exact same position 2 weeks ago...it sucks -_-
If you don't like waiting you should go for other sites. Crunchyroll is 2 episodes behind.
daisuki has the latest episodes, legally.
I get way too excited just for a basketball tournament that isn't even real...
I mean, Winter Cup is a real thing. http://wintercup2014.japanbasketball.jp/
Does anyone get the "logic" behind Phantom Shot?
kind of sad though that after putting so much effort into a special technique that it becomes somewhat neutralized as soon as people figure out the mechanics of it.
Based on the explanation, a nice option for Kuroko would be to choose a higher trajectory if an opponent steps back. On the other hand, his accuracy sucks when trying normal shots, so...
"How does this shot even work?" That guy, asking the real question.
Hey, at least it's not as bad as Prince of Tennis when it comes to super powered sport abilities.
^PoT was ridiculous but i love it all the same. it was pretty much the dbz of sports anime xD
When Kuroko is down, Kagami is already there to cheer him up!
They really compliment each other very well.
Best sport anime i've watched. Just my opinion.
Then you need to watch Baby Steps. So Good.
My favorite is "Kickoff To The Galaxy" (soccer anime)
yay!
I just found out that crunchyroll is 2 episodes behind other sites for this show..
Yeah... this episode came out on the 7th for other sites. Why is crunchyroll 2 weeks behind??
We already answered this question too many times. They didnt get streaming rights until 2 weeks passed.
Even if it is 2 weeks behing, are we going to go to a different site? NO! Crunchyroll Forever!
If you need the latest episode as soon as it's released, it's on Daisuki.
Yeah I've been watching it on Gogoanime since episode 1. Once Parasite ends I'm cancelling membership, crunchyroll has been awful license wise for almost a year.
i sort of don't understand the perfect copy i get how he copies Aomine/Midorima because their abilities are completely skill related but Murasakibara gets most of his power from his size and Akashi has more of a super power so how's it work
I'm not sure exactly but he compensates with his own skills. Like when I first copied Aomine, he wasn't as fast, but he slowed down in order to equal his change of pace. With Akashi he uses his own powers of observation.
The same observation he uses to copy players, he uses to predict their movements. Which isn't as accurate. I think Murasakibara's blocks are partially skill-related and he compensates with jumping power, but, again, I'm not 100% sure.
Could be that he notices what moves they are about to use so he reacts faster, leading to a more effective block, making it look like he can reach as high as Murisakibara that quickly.
I admit that ending of how Kasamatsu saying dont underestimate them is awesome, but the players in the background looks like they are constipated
Can't agree more lmao
You're a good captain Kasamatsu.
Free GP. Enjoy!!!!! ACXBGRWM4BU
Kasamatsu is so hardcore! *fan girling* He's my favorite character and that's why I'm cheering for BOTH Seirin and Kaijou...x'3 but this was also the hardest game to see D'x (extremely conflicted)
Gotta be honest, after this episode, I really want Kaijo to win
It is going to be close to the very end. I have a prediction. They Seirin edges Kaijo. Then gets shut down by Rakuzan. I predict this by looking back at the other games when Seirin faced the other members of the Generation of Miracles.
