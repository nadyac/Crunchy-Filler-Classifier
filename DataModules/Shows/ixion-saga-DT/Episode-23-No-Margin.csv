She was supposed to be gay ^^
they made it kind of obvious by showing every other member shirtless aside from her. if you think back, there were clues everywhere.
Remember the episode when they were at the pub? you could totally see what looked like boobs in KT's fantasy lol
now if they revealed marian as being trans at the end it wouldve been a HUUUUUGE let down
And window peeping after kons faked death, she didn't let him watch maria undress. And its still true that her female side comes out more when she's drunk. Not only in her talking but her thinking too.
Stand up ED has to have a hidden meaning, espesailly with how the finger pops up solo at first!
they also stand on a golden ball at the ending
With the finger, and the lyrics, I think it's pretty obvious what the reference is. You guys do know what DT means, right? Hint: It's not Dimension Transfer.
There is definitely a hidden meaning. lol
well.. right off the 'bat' his initials were E and D.. then he got hit in the balls, twice.. was tricked into taking viagra, but it didnt work.. lol i think we all knew what ED meant from the start..
You guys do realise they are standing on a golden ball too?
so he got dog poop on his hand, then when the vase fell he touched his face .......
I see I'm not the only one who noticed that.
I noticed it too!
SAME HERE LMFAOOOOO!!

Anyone else breath a sigh of relief for being strangely attracted to KT? I know I did! SAFE!

yessssssss
I'm curious as to what ridiculously dumb ending this show will have. I'm expecting the greatest of anti-climaxes.
/Watches hilarious episode > Proceeds to laugh hysterically until suffocation occurs.
Repeat for next episode.
2 EPSIODES LEFT!!!!! NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm pretty sure this is going for another season, there is no set end to it yet.
I agree Mario, they've made a point of contradicting some of whats common knowledge
they'll end the season with 26 or 27th episode or the forbidden 25 and 1/3 episode or on some number that doesn't make sense

Brother! Brother! Brother!
I was waiting for Pet's brother to show up
lol this is the only anime where i actually bother to watch the ending theme
The ending theme to "problem children from another world" is pretty great.
Damn right! Love that ending!
jajajaja. Everyone's big brother xDDD. I can't help but laugh about this absurdity.
what a good laugh, very funny
Now you know. EMILIAAA! Haha, I laughed so hard.
