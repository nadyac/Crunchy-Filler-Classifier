Goddamn TK is a fucking hero
I cracked up when someone (couldn't tell who) just said "Thanks." as casually as possible.
Not TK anyone but TK
I love TK's voice when he speaks Engrish.
^^ agreed

I've never laughed so hard at death scenes in my life.
It makes me feel like a sadist xD
Totally!!!
lol ikr the death scenes were hilarious. Everyone else's reactions each time someone died made me laugh even harder!!
They went full blown indiana jones on us for that ball scene!!
Holy shit ikr
They left the guy that can't swim in the water. He's cursed to revive and then drown for all eternity lol

ikr LOL
Someone is definitely picking favorites!
Wonder what was going through his mind when she said that.
Omg these deaths are hilarious XD
Ikr
So true! Haha
except TK to me though
The toilet flushing...lol.
his was a noble sacrifice
1 death that was worth it xD
you just can't skip the beautiful piano opener
Lol so true , i planned on skipping it after the first time i watched it because it was just to good and i didnt wanna over watch it...but , its so hard not to XD
what the hell is up with TK? never in my life has there been an anime with an american.. or.. what ever he is..
The best part is, not even he knows what he is saying.
but we do
Alliedsouls watch Kaze no Stigma
ok i think the whole war against ONE girl is dumb, but yuri is hot and this show is halarious. lmao i laughed so hard when the english speaking guy had that nobal save everyone moment, and nobody really cared. lmao.
I really do like the guy who only speaks english.
now what would happen if they dubbed this show...would he be french?

whats with that resident evil laser? XD
Doesn't Yuri look and act like Haruhi Suzumiya? You know, if she weren't as hyper and idiotic?
Ikr???

Those were some unusually murderous robbers.

First time I laughed at the death scenes.
I would fight God too if that was my backstory...
"im actually quite fond of you" "what are you? gay"

Pity Spelunky doesn't have a bottom to The Abyss
