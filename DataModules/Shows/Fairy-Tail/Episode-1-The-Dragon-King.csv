This anime is great so who cares what anyone else thinks
@LetsImage: OMG, you're right; and they even shove it in your face every opening -- although you don't realize what they're doing. @JohnQUnknown: ..and her left hand writing's terrible. Who'da thunk it? SPOILERS if you read the originals.
This anime just got so much better by the fact that characters are dying now holy crap; fights are gonna be so much more tense now; and Jellal can tell a person's a woman by just her feet, what a player


It's back baby. FAIRY TAIL IN ALL ITS GLORY.
@H0bbit1234 Also whats with the abs... Theyre up too high, and it looks really weird on Gray at 15:09...
@Hobbit1234 yeah I am also adjusting to the new art style but hey the ghost dragon didn't sound like Bowser from Mario N64
So i wasn't the only one that noticed the dragons sounding like Bowser in the beginning
Haven't they always been up that high? I remember thinking that when seeing Natsu like first time and thinkin "Holy shit!"
I'm seriously loving the Opening song!
1 second into the episode and i already started crying..... WELCOME BACK FAIRY TAIL!

WELCOME BACK FAIRY TAIL! I am with you Zak.

I just finished Fairy Tail's season 1 and i can't stop watching
is it just me or is the art style changed? Looks much better if it has changed
That was the quickest 24min's ever....CANT WAIT A WEEK!
And episode mash up from Series 1. Next week will be epic! All out grand fight?

I CANT WAIT!!
Don't smoosh Erza's cake. Ever.
One does not simply touch Erza's cake without getting hurt. Its a law that shall NEVER be broken
Nicholas Cage: Do you want this cake? Erza: I WANT THAT CAKE!!!
This comment goes well with my sig pic.




@Jadeaki you perv lol
yeh, made my day, but u realy should use spoiler to commets like these
@Jadeaki has learned to being perverted from Enro-Senin (Pervy Sage;Jiraiya)
Damnit Zeref, why you root of all evil?
Still not as bad as Danzo.
Danzo is the definition of asshole.
agreed danzo is a walking pile of elephant crap
Because he doesn't have what it takes to be the square of all evil.
OP and ED were totally NALU!!! <3
No room for imagination? I still end up with thoughts of Natsu with a male character. I think Lucy is the only female I'm willing to allow to have Natsu. I want him, but since I can't have him, she can.

Well she did allude to it again during MiraJane's modeling battle with Jenny but then got cut off when Lucy fell into Natsu--NALU4LIFE!!
Yeah... but go back and watch Happy's origin episode again and try to reconcile the deep emotions Natsu shows for Lisanna (including him snapping at Lucy for saying something like Lisanna did) with the deep pit of nothing since she returned
Natsu and Lucy best couple in Fairy Tail ^^ <3
THANK GOD IT BACK MY LIFE IS WORTH LIVING AGAIN
rewatched the entire series to prepare for this, it's gonna take a little while to get used to the new art style, and did anyone else think that the colors seemed a little dull?
LONG LIVE FAIRY TAIL!!!!
i think the coloration is to suggest a dark atmosphere to go along with the arc
i was so excited i was jumping in my seat. I did notice the changes as well. that'll take a little getting used too. but it was worth it.
@Rena-Ryuuguu thank you i thought the colors were a bit off but couldent place it
Did we really need the close up on Lucy's cleavage....... of course we did its fairy tail been so long i have almost forgotten.
Not only that, they made it a point to show as much of Wendy's legs as possible, taking turns showing front and rear angles going as high as her hip.

RISE AND SHINE FANDOM, IT'S TIME!!!

Fairy Tail is back with a vengeance new art style but at least is the same voice actors
The animation! Oh god! It's amazing!
Who's missing as far as voice actors?
@stanhry okay any voice actor changes you heard I want to know thank you
Yeah I noticed the art change immediately. It does seem to match the manga better than the previous series. Will take a bit of getting used to, but nice
Still needs the good ol'Fairy Tail magic circles
In regards to the VAs, there is no change as I recall. The original series ended due to a sex Scandal with Lucy's VA, Aya Hirano, but she's still voices Lucy here.
I started to cry I was so pumped up at the end I love this show
wow they are really pushing Nalu in the OP and ED xD
Hehe They Better Keep Pushing, My Ship Be Sailing So Goood Right NOW! ;D
If only it would actually happen! But I'm not holding my breath...
all I'm saying is... give NaSanna a chance...
NaSanna... NaLi? But then Gemini said Gray was interested in Lucy.. .but then there is Juvia... and maybe Ultear Although the only ship I really want to see sale is Erza/Jellal (that was so dirty of them!) and probably GaLe.
I am literally tearing up right now and I've only watched the OP. It has been so long... (T-T)
I'm just glad CrunchyRoll got Fairy Tail. I hate the Funimation site, it is the laggiest site in the world.
The character limit is not near long enough for me to describe my feelings, but I will say this: I look forward to watching this show.
Loved the new opening! Loved the new dark red Fairy Tail logo. Loving this revamp so far!

some animes are just worth the wait!
The opening is such a troll for LucyXNatsu fans....oh, Hiro Mashima when will you cave and just let it happen already and put us out of our ever-loving misery?
Ending even more so lol
