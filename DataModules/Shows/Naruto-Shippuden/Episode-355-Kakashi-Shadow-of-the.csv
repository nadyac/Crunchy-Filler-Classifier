Danzo.. master of the douche-style jutsu
+nazak231 i think he meant not that its ok but it would at least justify his actions. that is he is willing to do horrible things for the benefit of the town but the fact that he does horrible thngs and nothing good ever comes of them

Orochimaru dont even compare to Danzo when it comes being a conniving/evil son of a bitch at least you know orochi is a bad guy from the start not like Danzo who hides in the shadows pretending to be good..
Agreed I Really Hate Him
danzo didnt do any good deeds. Is stealing others' eyes for the village's sake? he is just selfish.
For a filler ark, its not half bad so far :/
a flashback of a flashback. flash-back-ception.
I just wish it wasn't right when Naruto found out Tobi's true identity. I can't be the only one here who wants to watch where things left off than this ill-timed filler arc...
but we want to find out what happened to Rin.. Makes total sense but i get ya its taking its sweet time!
Well is about Kakashi so it can't be bad!
I hope that even if it's filler, it is accurate filler that didn't stray from the mangaka's intentions.

It's probably a precursor to his snake form or something. It wouldn't make sense to make modifications to your own body without learning what works first after all.
It is amazing that Ochimaru was bad with little explanation and as I see this I think he was evil but could have been good if it were not for Danzo. Danzo jerking with Ochimaru is making me like Ochimaru. This is a good section.
I'm thinking it's more like another monster Orochimaru made, I don't see why he'd be there himself?
Pretty sure Orichimaru would be a dick with or without Danzo. His flaw was curiosity coupled with a lack or morals.
Sociopath
Damn, look how long Yamato's hairs got. And for the record, Fuck Danzo.
The fact that so many people hate Danzo is a testament to how well he's doing his job as a villain.
The foundation is important- but Danzo keeps secrets from the Hokage and really doesn't care about his shinobi as people.
Danzo reminds me of King Joffrey from Game Of Thrones. You Know he does a good job as a villain, but at the same time, you can't help but hate him.

Their definitely different personality wise. But they both do a good job at making you hate them.
Really liking this arc. I hate the ones that bring in random people that only exist for that arc. More please!
This isn't an arc, it's the new series.
we will re-live the shinobi world through kakashi and we will eventually make it back to the war in another 700 episodes.
I think something like this would make for a really good spinoff series.
I'm really enjoying the arc too! Though my hatred for danzo has grown quite a lot lol
now we need to look back at ero senins life and it will be over 1000 episodes long.
no sign of ANBU Itachi
however good this episode may have been, who else hopes that they get back to the main fight soon?
me it was geting to the bass point and wam filler
Kakashi is so beast as a kid!
hes a beast even as an adult!
So why is Kinoe so angry about friend killing when that was one of the requirements of the Foundation we saw in earlier episodes like with Sai?
Well, he never had friends any way. He was also probably just mad at Kakashi for questioning the Foundation. Mostly likely he was just saying that to get at Kakashi.
I wonder if he literally gets morning wood.

Huh. Danzo gets naming rights without having to pay the fee. He's probably named a couple of Hidden Leaf cemeteries too. Well, he's had a few filled anyways.
2014 = Year of the Kakashi
i thought it was Itachi Uchiha's year :<
enjoy, but buy premium already :) 99YCM4P7LEY WBSFWNJPU3T 6CEF8MHUH8G
danzo wants the power of hokage bad, if he come to power, he will have every criminal working for him, the leaf village will be the base for all the bad ninja, and where forbidden jutsu would be practice and u know akatsuki will take
