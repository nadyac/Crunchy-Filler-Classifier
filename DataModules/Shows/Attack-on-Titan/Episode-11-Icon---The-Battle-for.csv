look at that cliff hanger
lawl true dat
Commander Pixis would think of a super hot titan flash back at 11:40. Good plan, now let's see it in action. This anime is too awesome, i cried on the first episode. :'(
Anyone know Eren Yaeger is German? Yaeger in German means "Hunter".
They're all mixed races since everyone came to the wall like they said Asians did a few episodes back.
Does every attack on titan episode have to end so epicly? My heart will probably give out if it keeps up like this.
you need to know how to count girl, i dont see any 10 minutes wasted :/
Yeah if the intro was an actual 10 minutes....Oh what am I saying, I'd still watch the hell out of it every time. To. Damn. Epic.
Same here! A clip of the opening song was all it took to convince me to watch this anime
mikasa you bitch i said i'm not your little brother or a child

Maybe time is just a concept of human perception. An illusion...
or it just something that there but not there
my head hurts after reading the last few replies
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause and effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective point of view, it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey.... stuff.
*hits blunt* bruh who knew what time it was when the first clock was made?

It would be a very short anime. "LET'S KILL THE TITA-" *splat*.
Maby this could happen butttt also you never know what humanity can make
Lol I think Humanity would be more than capable of taking out titans If we can make bombs destroying miles and miles and miles of land we can find away to take out titans
MIND F'D, Eren attacked Mikasa, I do not get this, but this is still cool
@starmena keep in mind that this is not a modern society with access to advanced technology, they don't even have electricity, the 3d maneuver gear works mechanicaly
Attack on Titan...On a Saturday afternoon? Crunchy...you guys...are just awesome...
Stop with the homophobia, Oldthrashbar.

NO! YOU are awesome
Y u have ads that my only complaint about this site
So they can make money and actually eat food and not run a site not make any money off of it and die

Yeah but than I was in tears of agony when it ended with such a cliffhanger.
Yeah, that scene was basically the best.

As a mechanical engineer, I will devote the rest of my life to developing the 3D maneuvering gear. For the good of humanity, of course.
you dont need any remote controal for the claw, just follow the ball point pen. hiting the wall will set the claw to dig in and the pull form the gear will drive it in and set it for the release motion when the gear stops pulling.
In addition to the other problems, wouldn't the hook punching into a surface with that force just pulverize the surrounding material? The hook wouldn't stick, it'd fall away with the debris.
I'll test too. Just let me know when.
If your making one, I want in.
Yes, Definitely for humanity and NOT for our fun... Can I test it and help make it plz?
That ending... damn.


LOL^
^^ Omg... LOL @ Dacs123
Hes a Chris Brown fan its in the manga...
Anyone ever wondered how they build the walls while the titans where attacking them constantly? And where did they get all the stone. And how come they are already done with it? Even after 100 years, with their primitive technology?
According to MAL, there are 25.. :O
The manga has not even explained it thoroughly; readers only have gotten a surprising clue thus far. Most mangas are just as guilty as the worst anime for stretching out story sequences & explanations...
And if you know part of the reason, don't spoil us. We can wait.
My guess is that if the anime will last 25-26 episodes, and it's going to stay true to the manga... Then at the pace it's going, the secret of the walls' construction will be the very last reveal in this series. Heh heh heh...
the reason is... ...aliens
That fucking ending was.... wow..
Just wait till the next episode =P

Yea , and then they threw in that great big...........but. = )
I like big buts and I cannot lie.
YAY IT WAS RELEASED EARLIER TODAY! Good thing I kept going on crunchyroll to see when it was going to be released.

No, don't! It'll impact your enjoyment of the anime so far. Several friends did that & it really messed up all the fun of the suspense of the anime for them.
Mikasa*

It actual adds to the experience. There were a couple of scenes that the anime added (not in the manga) and they where pretty good.
@Time2Warp I'd have to say you pretty much nailed it. Erin in titan mode seems to be driven by what ever thoughts are strongest during transformation. Like when he was killing titans in titan mode prior to this. Kind of like the Hulk

To be sure sir, to be sure.
Wasn't it?!
i want that cg file of the city for sandboxing NAO!!
I know, right! I had my eyes glued to the screen, lol, imagining...
6 and 1/2 hours early sweet
Does Eren seem to be more mature or somthing?
He has great development. He used to be scared, and cry a lot, but now he is a badas* that fights Titans head on.
yep character growth, after all he's been through.

Well he explained at least a small part of a theory that doesn't actually explain anything. Plus I might add the manga has yet to validate those words.
Well he had to make something up for why they had a titan on their side that was also a human :V
joblagz, lets not try to make a harebrained theory appear as if it is a manga spoiler, Surprisingly I am pretty certain of a rough origin theory behind titans, and would wager they were not directly a human creation. Third party anyone?

And the Oscar for best supporting actor [and badass] goes to... Pixis from Attack on Titan!
DID HE JUST FUCKING DO THAT
Your profile pic was my exact expression.
10 sec till episode is released.......... LET THE EPICNESS BEGIN!
