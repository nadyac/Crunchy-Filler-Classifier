I really like this anime. THe combination of comedy and drama make it even more hilarious. It is a noteworthy anime. Yona is such a naive seductress! Only her can capture all of them without even knowing it
Dang I wish I had snake eyes, and I was hoping he would've kept the bells.
There are contact "lenses" that can make the wearers eyes look unusual - slits included.
I think the combination of comedy and drama works because the characters are so well-written. This scene works exactly because of Hak's personality and Kija's reaction towards him.
@mahuja, they were selling those a few days ago when I got a new contact prescription. Dunno if they had them on hand (most definitely not in my prescription, being as terrible as it is), but they were certainly selling color-contacts.

That squirrel is so cute trying to eat that rock, spitting the rock out its mouth and cuddling with Yona
About that rock, it looks like a diamond in the second scene :O
@Nightfall23, if they accidentally discovered a diamond deposit in the village while digging out of the cave, omg

omg best episode
that wasn't diamond, but glistening squirrel spit on the rock.
Yona is my favorite heroine in a long time. Her progression is Great
She's the best since Haruhi Fujioka from Ouran Host Club.
You should watch Twelve Kingdoms. Yona reminds me a lot of Nakajima Youko.
Agreed with Doli. Saiunkoku is another I highly recommend.
Yes Saiunkoku is a wonderful series. I wish season two wasn't so difficult to find.
I will watch that next thanks.
the moonlight is so lonely and silent
@MONIKUE7 I don't think there's a set episode count for this season so for all we know this could be the start of a long running anime


It's a very gentle and warm series, yet it doesn't flinch on the action. A rare gem!
The manga is on going with about 60+ chapters...so hopeful they keep this series going!!!
Take notes 90% of you shounen MC's. THIS is how you build a successful harem!
What be cute and nice?
Actually care for and respect others. Reach out to them and form a meaningful connection.
yeah alot of them try to do that but often it feels forced or ludicrous. Like im so sick of mc's making friends with people who literally only 10 secs ago just tried to murder him and everyone they cared about. What? No! People dont do that
Seriously one of the best series I've watched in a long time. It doesn't feel like a "girl" or a "boy" series, which is something I admire. At the same time, they have a strong female lead with interesting characters following her. So good.
I think it's technically shojo (makes sense with the male character designs) but I agree that it seems to have appeal to both audiences. The characters are well-balanced.
I hope this series carries on for a long time, it's so good
Why cant more harems have likeable mc's like this one? I like it when the mc "earns" the harem. Most of the time they just fall into their lap, even if the mc is a perverted weirdo or an utter pussy. Yona AND her harem are cool. A++++++++++
Yona really is the best. Her character development is fantastic. However, if you want another series where the heroine "earns" the harem, I'd recommend Hanasakeru Seishounen. I could believe each guy falling for her in that.
Hanasakeru Seishounen is another good one, yes. Highly recommended.
well most harems are for dudes, the type of dudes who have no chance at girls, so the shows are geared towards them, because if you had a sexy, cool main character it wouldn't resonate with your Regular Nerdy Guy
Recently, there was "Supernatural battles are becoming common place". And I thought that guy deserved his harem for being a nice guy despite being such a dorky chuunibyou.

"I will always call you princess, because you're my princess. <3" Just say it, Hak! Damn!
I have to say, it must be painful to him that she's so blind to it. Hell, it even hurts me just watching. I think having him call her princess when the others are allowed to call her by her name might've given him the wrong idea... Ouch...
i0am6me, I don't know about that...I thought that having him the only one to call her princess made him even more important to Yona compared to the others. You just got to look at it deeply, not superficially.
Seeing those brief flashbacks and Yona in this episode...she sure has changed hasn't she? I'm proud of our redhead princess.
I do miss her long hair though
I forgot she had it
I really love this anime, I hope it dos well enough in japan to make another season in the future,
12:16 - 13:05 LOLOLOL Hak is having too much fun
The comedic moments in this series are exceptional! Love when they do the cartoon bits and character expressions (Think Kija's drop into the world of insects}. The work on this series is definitely top class! Kudos to the project team!!!
This is what every girl who's ever loved Fushigi Yugi was waiting for. This anime is BOSS. I just wish I'd discovered it a bit later so I wouldn't have to wait for the next week to watch an episode! It's so good!
I know what you mean. I was going to wait and marathon it when it finished but after watching the first episode I was hooked and couldn't wait for next ep.
this is the common thing to do nowadays

My exact thoughts, I think my heart broke at that moment T_T Hak <3
It's to commemorate her father's memory, to remind herself that she has a duty as a monarch so that she wouldn't be complacent, and to unconciously set a relationship barrier between Hak and her as she still pines for Su-won
I thought that white fur on his mask was actually his hair so I was surprised when I found out he wasn't actually old
Wasn't a flashback dated '18 years' earlier? Ages have been given along the way: Yona is 16, Hak is 19, Yoon is 15, White Dragon Kija is 20, Blue Dragon Shin-Ah is 18, Green Dragon Jai-Ha (?) is 25. I think Soo-Won is same age as Hak.
In the manga, it says that Hak is 3 years older than Yona, but maybe the way the birthdays fall in the year, since she just turned 16, he's 18 heading for 19. 18 or 19.... close enough.
It's actually Shin-ah. And Ki-ja. Grr... translations!
Yeah it really bothers me too...
Xina and Ci-ga
Poor Hak, Yona doesn't consciously recognize how much he loves her...
