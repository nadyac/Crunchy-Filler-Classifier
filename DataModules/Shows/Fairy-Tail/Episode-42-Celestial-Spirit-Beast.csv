someone get the celestial spirit king a snickers because your not you when your hungry
Ikr! the premise of this arc is... well it's total filler.
hahaha.
I think he will prefer a milkyway if you know what i mean
He's not actually a king. He's a beauty contest winner. he was "crowned" Mr. Galaxy.
How did lucy get her clothes back...i must of not been paying attention?



It might need some Gaviscon but I doubt that's enough with Natsu's flames
Vice versa: The Celestial Spirit Thing had no choice but to let Natsu and Happy storm inside \m/


Yesssssssssss, I agree! <3
I didn't recognize her at first. She looks good like that.

looks more like a thumb robot from spy kids
i was thinking like i have seen this thing before lol
Wow it does look like it.

I just..... I..... I love it.
'I'm going to slice you like a fish!" classic.
I like this arc a lot because it somewhat show's Natsu's dedication to Lucy. But I CAN NOT WAIT for the Tartaros arc! If you haven't gotten that far in the manga you need too, every single page is splendid and full of badassary.
me tooo, but sadly it's going to start in spring this year, so around the beginning of april
comment below will have manga spoilers!

Tataros arc wont start in spring since were going to back to cannon material at start of spring and we need to get through the sun village arc first.


Is it just me or does the eclipsed celestial spirit king really look like the Nightwalker from Mononoke Hime?
I think he looks like a thumb on a body. A single colored body with a "space" theme.
First requirement of being a celestrial wizard: Big 'ol tittes
Where do you think they store all their celestial spirit magic? It's gotta go somewhere.
damn, I would be perfect for the job

Nope, Me too. I would put a spoiler thing on that :x NO ONE CAN KNOWWW cx
I'm not the only one who counts down until the simulcast, right? RIGHT? (Please say yes (>.<)) BTW I love this anime, Natsu is the best salamander!!!
Aye ma'am!
The anime is nice, this arc is shit though
Who else was staring at the countdown clock for a good 10 minutes?
I was holy crap xD
I've forgotten all about it. Counting down the days until Monday's chapter instead.
Natsu's and Lucy's celestial spirit clothes match! I love it!
that ended relatively fast..
It's like a nightmare that won't end! WHEN WILL THIS ARC BE OVER!?!?
next episode is the last for this arc
Looking forward to see how they fix the time gap problem. Guessing something like the time was disturbed ... so no time gap this time.
Anyone else feel like this arc seems more like a non-cannon movie?
This is a filler arc.
Did anyone else think that the spirit king looked like a thumb thumb from the sky kids movies?
