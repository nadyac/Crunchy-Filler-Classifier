My life is going to be consumed by this show
The past week, waiting for this episode has been hell. I am currently working on a time machine to make life easier.

HOLY S**T Mikasa!
bring me with you.
Comrade!
El. Psy. Congroo.

It doesn't matter how many time I watch this opening, it is always as epic as ever
At the end of the episode the way she spoke made me feel so sexy xD
It must be the basement!

well of course, what other titan would be able to adopt a perfect fighting stance?
I love the part when they are all just standing there with their hair blowing in the wind, such epicness...
Omg, BOOM HEADSHOT. Best I've ever seen ^_^ Crazzzzzy...
The new titan is total brawlic, he took off a titans head. EPIC.

Homerun!!! I didn't know Titan's can play baseball.
well there were two notable headshots. one was erens epic homerun... the other was the calmest suicide ever "yush" boom
krap I stepped in titan.
FINALLY NO DELAY!
Miracles DO happen!

there have been plenty of anime shows that didnt have a manga or novel to begin with so theyre def not lazy lol

mainly people just need to click that Spoiler box. Seriously don't be a jerk, click the box
Important note: Spoiler boxes should be used for anything that discusses facts from the manga, not for thoughts of the current episode or own opinions of what you think will happen. People shouldn't read this till they viewed the ep.

I can remember when I first watch Bleach for the first time ... seeing the raw fury and power when Ichigo let loose for the first time against Kenpachi. I never thought I would feel it again ... until today. Whoa.

I agree entirely. I remember that Kenpachi / Ichigo fight and how intense it was, and this episode had a similar feeling of intensity. Good stuff.

that had to be the best titan body i've seen since the show started!! i fangirled so hard. O.O
Those Titan bodies get you hot eh?

I died a little after seeing that bod. Oh. My God.
a dude having no skin is an odd fetish... not gonna lie, sorry
hahah kinda ruin the impact of its appearance cuz some ass ruined it a few weeks back.
I read some of the manga because I was going to die if I didn't....but the show is still as good if not better even knowing what will happen. You get so into it it's like you forget what's coming!
If you don't want to get major spoilers, don't click spoiler tags. Heck If you read any comments at all before watching the episodes, you likely will get at least that episode spoiled. It is your own fault. Go cry somewhere else.
@squijum25, so true!
@bk3k well i know i'm not watching this as simulcast but people shouldn't say anything about future episodes in the comments, it's rude as hell. I remember a lot of that going on in Fate/Zero so i just stopped reading comments.
The spoiler box is for comments about next episodes / manga. There's nothing as a "spoiler of the current episode", that's what the comments are for, to talk about the current episode.

And a big "Watch the episode BEFORE you read the comments " to you.
How about a colossal titan-sized FU to those who click spoiler tags and complain about getting stuff spoiled. Just DON'T click. And don't read ANY comments til the end of episodes you fools.
If it's not to be read, why bother writing it? seriously, don't be a dick. don't try to blame others for your actions.
a big "No Durr" to y'all- OF COURSE I don't read comments before watching. I'm talking about those punks who posted unflagged spoilers about Eren's fate several episodes ago. Kanben shinasai.
Eren's fate??? Does he like get eaten or something!?!?! D:

Damn straight eren whole reason i feel in love with this show dont know if i could watch it if they get rid of him already
My sunday just got 100x better then 20 mins later back to shit cmon next sunday please. XD

still hoping eren and mikasa get together
