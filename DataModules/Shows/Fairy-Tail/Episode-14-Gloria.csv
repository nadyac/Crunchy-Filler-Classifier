"I'm fired up..." Things just got real XD
Laxus has become such a badass! I wish the fight would've been longer but it was still awesome!
When Laxus said that I had to pause the episode I was laughing too hard!
"I am angry" from Erza was also epic I was like well we already new that... now that is another level. AWSOME
Erza's second origin armor was simply badasss
@Minky, Right! I've been reading the manga almost since it started, and I even remember when they first announced the Anime, they do an incredible job on this show and I couldn't imagine a better voice cast or style for it.
Advance like a wild wind, youngsters! Your fiery blood, sweat, and tears are as beautiful as sunshine! Fear not, young ones. Move forward and that shall become your path. ~Mavis Vermilion
great quote!
I dont think sting should have given up. He should have been ready to fight and then see lector and power back down then... and then Gajeel would cold clock him while hes not looking. Fairy tail wins! lol
Translators get a 1up for that one! Nice!
Dat opening...so much hype!
Back-On is the shit
Dat.
i like it, i think i like chain better though
Dat part with Lucy and Yukino....I got chills, man.
I like it but I like the last one better

ESC074NIDAN...I 100% truly wholeheartedly agree with you.

I think Minerva comes back later. I read some manga before by mistake and she was doing something new. I had no context so I can't say more but I wouldn't anyway or it would be a spoiler.
I love crazy sadistic freaks like Minerva simply because I know the main characters are gonna kick their ass at some point.

When Luxus said Natsu's line, with the same cheeky ass grin, I lost my shit!!!
"I'm all Charged up!" spark for realz? A spark is something that happens when i rub my feet on the carpet really really fast together... Tsk tsk

@Kaka0 I think "I'm all charged up." Is more fitting. Why is they didn't think of this?
"I'm all charged up" Reminds me of a battery lol
*beep* *beep* *beep* Laxus is fully charged.
Is it just me, or, is it, the more powerful the the level, the less of clothing there is......
ok, sooooo it's official! Juvia and Erza have no nipples.... DANG!
its like when piccolo took off his weighted clothes in dragonball z less things in the way
Omega Good Job
Yah, Erza's new armor was completely open chested... There were no nipples where there should have been, either that or the armor does some freaky boob stretch...
@MightyMidgit So her armor reveal is supposed to be all dramatic, but the only thing I was thinking was, "Girl where yo nipps @!?!?" D:
Lyon and Cheria are blasting off again.
Kinda reminded me of Team Rocket from Pokemon lol
@dminer I'm with you bro. I was please don't let anyone fuck this moment up! when they finally embrace it was like a huge weight came off my shoulders!
@dminer ithought the same thing. was waiting for him to get wasted as he jumped into Stings arms. Oh well. It was a great feels moment tho..
Oh man that would of been depressing if Lector was destroyed right there and then
and then, as Lector and Sting embraced their long lost friends..........they were both squished by a giant dragon's foot :3 I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED SO HARD!!!!!!! Oh cruel humor...
Am I the only one that had tears at the end?
i feel you
I cried too :')
its kinda hard not to. kind of like when a non-canon arc managed to get us crying over a friggin' cloth doll...

Lector's still annoying, I'm heartless
IM diggin Gray n Juvias moment... Gray "How long ru gonna hold my hand?" Juvia"Forever" Gray"So scary!!" Nothing frihens a man like true love... or a mgic weilding stalker.
Sting, your a smart man to know when to give up. I commend you for that. Fairy Tale was tired. But they are like zombies. They just wont stay down. And your reward for that was getting Lector back. Because you would have died elsewise.
now it's time for Sting and his buddy to change to Fairy Tail Members XD
@ tetsuya-chan as i was watching each fight i was thinking after each one i bet they all join fairy tale lol
whhaaaaaaaat !?!? they cut the laxus fight short!!!! i was looking to see him fight for once >:(
it was that short in the manga
i dont remember it to be that short though, i think we had a complete chapter for his fight, i dont remember though
A whole chapter = 10 min in the show
All the battles seemed short because they have been showing tiny clips for the past couple of episodes and finally decided to wrap them up here. Plus when you compare them to like the Garou Knights fights... yeah WAY SHORTER
I' hoped for 1 episode, 1 fight. But I'm happy with whatever they do.
oohh liking the new OP but missing the old OP now.
Started singing the old opening as soon as the episode started :/
Way too many spoilers in the new opening. I should've watched it with my eyes closed :-/
Ya, I hate when shows do that. Naruto's bad about that sometimes too.
Only spoilers if you know what's coming, so you have already read the manga I assume.
One Piece opening spoilers are even worse.
The moment when Sting surrendered and saw Lector was so powerful. He was strong enough to admit that he couldn't compare to fairy tail the way he was. Great episode felt like only 2 minutes.
It takes a great man to unsheathe his sword. It takes a greater man to know when to put it away.
@AvidReader110 You just blew my mind.
@Akumanomi your pic is one of the funniest moments in fairy tail. good choice lol XD
Back-On!!!! new fairy tail op >.< So good!!!
Did Erza's breasts grow in Nakagami Armor?
i was thinking the same thing!
Either way, it definitely revealed her astonishing lack of nipples!
Fairy Tail today, SAO tomorrow. Every otaku's dream. c:
SAO definitely is not bad HOWEVER i will admit that the first 14 episodes AKA Aincrad, was awesome and i was all about it. When that arc ended HORRIBLY, ALO SHOULD NOT have happened. It went from 5/5 (Epic) to 1.5/5 (Fail), a true shame =-(
Having said that i have no doubt the people making the show got this message loud and clear from the fanbase, and will make amends with the new season and achieve some redemption! We shall see....
just wait and see. :-P btw the flood of people going to watch SAO is hat caused the site to go haywire earlier today.
@MatthewGade actually that was EXACTLY how aincrad ended in the LN.
Yeah it really has nothing to do with what the fanbase wants that's just what happens in the light novels.
Hot DAMN. WHAT AN EPISODE.
IKR!! especially Lector and Sting <3
Fairy Tail>Fireworks
Why must these episodes feel like 5 minutes??? ;_;
I had goosebumps all throughout the episode.
I read the manga but this is epic <3
