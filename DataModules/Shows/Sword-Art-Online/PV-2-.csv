was that kirito with the beam saber? is his avatar a girl? looks like his signature trench coat

It's not a spoiler. Did you watch the SAO Extra that you're supposed to see before this? Also, main plot being revealed is hardly a spoiler.
Maybe its Yui all grown up?!?!?!?!
The Unkowns of saoa got a uniform
This is anime, appearances can be decieving when it comes to gender... *cough* Armin *cough*
This preview is 7 seconds longer than the first one. Still can't wait for the first episode!
THE HYPE!
THE GUN PORN!!!
honestly that'd be a bit creepy if that was him.
That's a big gun.
Will Asuna be in this? Or will Kirito get a new love interest? I really love Asuna and don't want to see any sister/cousin x brother/cousin romance T^T
I second this. Hopefully his sister is gone for good.
I wouldn't mind Suguha staying....just as long as she gets her own love interest. Something well outside the bounds of incest.
NO asuna will not be in GGO only in the scenese of AlFeild
Suguha is not even his real sister.
okay this isn't much of a spoiler if you research but kirito doesn't tell asuna about ggo to keep her out of danger god people the guy isn't a stuck up prick ...
And before you know it, everyone watching SAO II will be saying "*BOOM* HEADSHOT!"
When i hear any song from SAO, I just KNOW its from SAO, and it gets me so emotional T~T.
Am I the only one that's extremely exited to hear the entire opening???
i like how the intended for the whole kirito gender swap to be a suprise but evryone already know thats whats gonna happen lol
I cannot friggin' wait for next Saturday.
It's going to be fun seeing everyone running around with guns, but at the same time I am going to miss the fantasy elements from the previous "games" they were playing.
Never bring a sword to a gun fight...unless, ya' know, you're Kirito...
Already excited for this and light novel readers have told me its leagues better than the first two arcs which makes me even more excited.
it was kirito but i don't want to spoil it
Kirito is a girl in this season it's called Gun Gale Online
Well a girl with a guys body

ercorn is correct on that one if your a dehard fan like me you know this and if not GO F*** YOURSELVES!!!
Ohhhhhh guns are the knew art of sword ^^
I cant wait much longer...
Are you all excited?? 23hrs 45mins to go for "Link Start"
Hopefully there will be 360 noscopes.
The thing that sucks is that Asuna will not be in it
