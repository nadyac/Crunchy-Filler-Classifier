That 1000 armed Buddah. Netero would be proud.
Netero would have enveloped Madara with indiscriminate love, with his Zero Hand!
Netero would absolutely destroy Madara
Are you guys serious lol? Madara and hashirama are on a different level than Netero. Madara's susanno is HUGE and was casually cutting moutnain ranges. Hashirama's buddha is on par with that and dwarfs the kyubi in size.

Madara's face on a mountain would be like Kenpachi's face on your bedroom ceiling. What a thing it would be to wake up to...
^^^ I lol'd so hard at that. IDK why it doesn't have more thumbs up.
Glad Naruto's back! Madara scaring little girls LOL
You guys are missing the point wouldn't you WANT the scariest lookin dude to have his face on the cliff side? Nobody ganna come mess with you then! Everyone in the village would be scared shitless, but regardless mission complete =-0
I blame Danzo.
Yes!!!! Let us blame Danzo!!!! I knew he was secretly behind this!!!
RoyalRaider: Or people would mistake the Hidden Leaf Village for being the birthplace of Ninja Hair Metal. Either one.
Hey if you're leader scares the little girls in your village his face will probably scare the piss out of the little girls from enemy villages
WOOOOOO!!! Flashbacks inside of Flashbacks!!! YEAH!!!
Kage means shadow. If you dnt believe me notice Kage mane no justu and Kage bunshin no juts Shadow paralysis and Shadow clone find which two words are in both. So now we know that Hokage means _ shadow.As the leader of the village its most
Important but as we learned in shogi the Hokage isn't.Now as we remember what Itachi said a Shinobi works from the shadows and works for the good not to be recognized. So put the pieces together. The leader works in the shadows, and the
Okay let me just put it together. The name is the country the village is allianced with and shadow. So kazekage of the sand is joined with wind and is therefor the windshadow or Kazekage. The leader works in the shadows for the village.
Ikuzo, smart man.
If only they explained that in the episode, hey?
The more I learn about Madara, the more he's becoming my favorite Villain.
I would agree with you though that perhaps he didn't think of himself as a villain and could argue its just a matter of perspective. Though that's true with anything and you have to go with the socially designated/acceptable behavior.
I get what you're saying, but all they're trying to do is prevent war and hardship. What they're doing to them may seem like they're doing the world a favor, although they have their own ways of doing it, which in itself causes war and ...
HardshipExperiencing a war and all the trouble within it is scarring and drive a person insaneMost of us haven't experienced war and troubles so would most likely never understand their painThe methods aren't the best but they want the best
no way pain for life
Madara's the saddest villain imo.
Its people like the Second Hokage and Danzo with their black and white, inhumane methods of dealing with things that created people like Uchiha Madara and Uchiha Sasuke. Compassion can lift and sink a nation, go figure.
@3333i: can't be helped--too many people were complaining.
@3333i: He became mad when Hashirama and Tobirama were talking about getting rid of the Uchiha clan because they were dangerous. Madara feared for his clan's survival since Tobirama was likely the next Hokage after Hashirama.

It's too bad though.. if madara hadn't gone awol and fought the first so much he would have lived longer, and tobirama can be a prick at times but he would not make stupid decisions with madara watching him.

Now I see how the 1st was so OP. That woodworking and Sage Art together is like dropping an AtomicBomb on top of another AtomicBomb. So much power its almost pointless to fight. Those two skill sets feed into eachother like crazy.
Lets hope Naruto does same in the future. Ninetailbeast-sage-mode!
Finally don't u ever do that week break shit again naruto
mecha naruto special -_______-
I'll take a week break over a week of filler.
nah other way around for me
hashirama's buddha jutsu is just too op haha.. anyways ending was great, and it was sad to see madara crush his previous dreams
yea i no right! its funny how the kages got owned by madara's final susanoo, while hashirama effortlessly destroyed it
@Core1019 I see what you did there.
@3333i Hashirama destroyed the final susanoo W/Ninetails inside, so what they lost too wasn't as strong. Besides, hashirama is just OP (overpowerd) with the sage mode, wood techniques that seal/drain chakra and Tsunade perma heal passive.
yea i no with nine tails inside it was way stronger haha! non sage mode hashi can tie with regular final susanoo
His techniques just pick up tailed beasts like they're his plushies
"Ore wa..." what a great cliffhanger Sasuke.
In 10 years (the amount of time it will take to finish the actual story), there will be Naruto Shippuden 2. Where the characters will use Kuchiyose: Edo Tensei to resurrect Naruto, Sasuke and Itachi to retell Naruto Shippuden in flashbacks.
Dude... don't give them any ideas...
The series will likely be finished sometime next year, unless they do more filler.
I was exaggerating. I love the story and the Naruto 'world building' but this never ending Edo Tensei is freaking ridiculous. The entire concept of putting an end to fighting for peace doesn't make sense since no one truly dies.
Orochimaru doing the next episode PV is freaking scary <3
Haro! Orochimaru-des!
Imagine my joy when I stay up all night and right before I'm about to go to bed, I see a Crunchyroll post on facebook about the new episode (I had completely forgot it was Thursday lol).
Lord Orochimaru doing the preview? I like
That's a first, Methinks!
hello people watching this early with me
hi
so..... in other words.. madara simple had a post traumatic stress disorder or (PTSD) that was never able to recover from?? hmm sounds like someone should have come up with a psychology no jutsu technique. problem solved.
Muahahaha... XD
And let's not forget Tobirama's paranoia towards the Uchiha. For crying out loud he was making judgements based on rumor.
For those all writing that those episodes are fillers. They are NOT. Next filler episode will be mecha Naruto 1 hour promoting new game special which will be aired at 11 September
watching leaves blow is filler inside an episode. we know wind blows shit, and it aint the dramatic. the episode might not be filler, but clips repeatedly shown from that same episode or weeks earlier is sponging up our time.
Guys don't worry, they gonna b**** about it anyway filler or not filler, they can be happy what they ged they should stop naruto for 5 Months for then to Comprehend s***
The problem is those people don't want a story, they want a fighting show. With nothing but fighting for 24 minutes straight. That kind of show wouldn't last at all. Definitely not 10 years. It's be boring and everyone would stop watching.
That wouldn't even be good enough, as the last guy complaining said that leaves blowing in the wind is filler. Well in that case, what they really want is a bunch of still images....oh wait the manga has that. Go read it.
@ziegen No it's not. Depicting the environment is not in any way "filler". It's done in every single fricking thing ever. You will never find any show, movie, comic, manga, or story that is nothing but action. Unless it's terrible.


It is coming to a head in the manga.
Yeah.... there is a LOT more to go... all fighting ... alll

I need more.... of tobirama
no.. he screwed everything up lol no way i dont like him at all
Well I wouldn't go so far as to dislike him, but his paranoia towards the Uchiha led to a great many problems in the future. As the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
tobirama is a danzo. or i guess danzo is a tobirama.
