He likes hairless hot MILFS if the mole were to have kids first, he might have liked her al ot better
Youre balls are mine!!! lol the look on Erics face
[This comment has been removed] <--- Eric's balls
what balls?
Erec has a joy stick with no coins! How is he gonna play Peck-man or Hornky-Kong...
Forget the look, what about him screaming from phantom pain?
Completely and totally lost it laughing on that scene!!!!!

Also shocked and surprised this series is still broadcasting. When it first started I thought it would last 12 episodes with maybe an OVA.

They made a joke about that in one of the previous episodes. Something along the lines of, "Don't these type of shows end by now?" I have a feeling this show is going to be around for at least 24 episodes. Hopefuly more.
Soon as im like 'haha caught you blue monkey' the explanation mind fucks me..
And we're back to joking about balls XD This show is hilarious
Ah, this show, is actually good.
lol you're just finding that out now?

that had me rolling to lol when he grabs his no nuts self down there and looks up with that face.... timing was perfect.
Agreed~ ED has some post-traumatic stress disorder lol That was the funniest part of the whole episode.

The alternate title for this episode should be "A Squirrel and his Nuts".
He's got a weird obsession with people's balls...
gotta love this show. Nearly made me fall off f the sofa because I was dying of laughter.
I love this show. "Your balls are mine!!!"
Studio Disclaimer: no real talking monkey has been harmed in the production of this episode
yay another episode
a filler episode within a filler anime?

why'd you put a spoiler tag on this? I've got the same question tho, Why no subs on the songs and are the songs as funny as I'm imagining them to be?
Well, seems i can't add url's to the comments, so add this watch?v=gk0yJbz7Yi8 to the end of youtube url and there you have the song with subs.
Your balls are mine!
just making sure. they did hear it talk right? o-o
best episde yet, lol
Episode 13 and 14 both had such great endings haha
