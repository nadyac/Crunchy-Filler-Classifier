13th episode of filler... We may not make it...
Madara Uchiha is the Grinch of Christmas
Obito = ghost of christmas Future; Madara = ghost of past; Orochimaru = ghost of present; Danzo = Scrooge and Naruto is Little Timmy. Poor little Timmy trying so hard to be himself unphased by the evil around him and happy of what he has
yup u right
lol
Danzo as Scrooge probably wouldn't even try to save Naruto (Little Timmy). Would probably say letting him die would be for the good of the village. "His death would prevent a bird from pooping on the stonesheads of the great hokages" LOL XD

Why make fillers when the anime's about to get to the really good parts of this arc? @_@?
so the animation can be top notch hopefully, either way I'm not complaining
Speaking of animation, did you see Sasuke's hand when he was clutching the dirt? Damn, i'm not sure what that's supposed to be but it's sure as hell not a hand
I don't get the filler to make better animation excuse. That's a week of bad ratings and extra work for some poor interns. That's how you get a 400 ep series that could have been done in 200. Its a money machine don't tell me otherwise.
19:56-19:58 gross hand
I think the old animation pre-shippuden was better. I think it gave them a lot more character.
Both brothers ride together, Fight together and Die together... Sasuke & Naruto <3
They had 2 kisses. I feel sorry for Sakura after all
fuck yea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Naruto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!kjnfsdkjhksdhfjknsdfhksja
Lol this episode makes me sick. well im sick literally. why does Madara is still strong even though he dont have other eye and got beaten up a lots o times?
Yep.
JoBert_Calpez: Because the plot says so. There is absolutely no rational reason behind it.


I'm afraid to check the above comments because I really don't want to know!

Even if he lives, his screen time certainly dies.

I dunno why... but for some reason I'm imagining a fusion jutsu of some kind is the only way to save the both of them. So we end up With a Nasuro Uchumaki... I've watched too much DBZ...
Databusion - HA!
WOAH, EVERYONE! TAKE A LOOK, AT THIS EXOTIC SPECIES! I haven't seen anything like it... It looks like a Dragonball fan... Only his comment wasn't down-voted to oblivion instantly :O
Kiba and Akamaru already do a fusion, if that's anything to be considered in-universe.
LMFAO AT IXKINGXI COMMENT!
lol just like Vegeto.
I always get the feeling Hinata is looking at Naruto's dick whenever she uses the byakugan.
Well the whole throbbing veins part doesn't help either.
doesn't her byakugan only allow her to see chakra ?
I just wish there was more then just a tease of romance, but the author is shy on that subject.
LOL
@twistdshade Or so she'd have you believe.....

To be fair to Obito, Madara had all the tailed beasts right before him. Obito had to search the world for each one seperately.
And also Madara is far more op than Obito. When Akatsuki was doing it, they took several days to extract one bijuu, while Madara alone was able to draw in all 9 alone in that short amount of time.
Also it helps that Madara didn't have to restart the rituals that Obito had to spend literal years prepping for (hence why they waited so long to actively hunt the beasts) due to them have been at the very least partially digested by the GM
and Madara had an alive Gedu statue will it was just idle for the akatsuki

damn it i dont want a filler ;--; i want to see naruto and sasuke kick ass

This an't filler. It was all in the manga.
Next episode will be filler though
speaking of Guy I don't recall seeing him for 20 or so episodes now.
tbh i don't even remember what happened or where the heck lee is :/
23 mins feel like ten seconds..
If I only had a dollar for every time a girl ended up doing a faceplant while trying to run in anime...
I actually laughed when she fell,
Ok! Lets run as fast as I can unaware of the broken ground below your feet. lol
Well, I guess since 2014 ended now they are just going to bombard us with 6 months worth of fillers.
meh as long as they are good i don't even mind
GGWP MADARA FED.
Om nom nom. Madara is most satisfied.


@princess2125, your comment slowly drains the hope of humanity; if there is any, that is.
report tailed beast for feeding lol
Tobi asking some serious questions. "What does it feel like to poo?" -Tobi 2014
This show really knows how to put the heroes in a tough spot. loving it.
A double episode would of been nice for christmas
looking forward to this!
You too LOL
ive been waiting forever
yay been waiting for this part to be animated

Everyone stop feeding Madara.
It took 9 members of Akatsuki 3 days to seal one tailed beast. Madara seals all 9 beasts in seconds.
