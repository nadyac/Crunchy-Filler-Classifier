Please tell me I am not the only one creeped out by Juglaburk.
Jugglabark, the closet perv with puppets for friends. Did this fool fall on his head or is it that he never grew up from childhood? Did his body grow yet his mind stayed a child? Well at any rate, nice one Princess!! Three cowlick killer!
sigh... jugglabark is a fruit XD kill himmm!!!!!!!!!!
freaky
Wonder how she feels about mustaches then?
"Like a little bitch", i died.
I'm cereal...super cereal (why did I find that so funny?) and haha that new Incognito ED lolol
That made me laugh so hard too! haha
it was funny because LEon said it XD
Heheh!! Erec's face was priceless!!! That poor guy never gets a break! He deserves something good to happen to him one day.
and when i thought there was a normal person in this show Juglaburk ruins it all
Wow that Jugglaburk has a weird fetish lmfao
Definitely worth 3 stand-up cowlicks
At first i thought he was going to rape her or something but then all the stuffed animals came out then other stuff happened ... that was totally freaking weird
Jugglaburk, what a pretty boy you were, what a creapy personality you had. That was good. As was the ED. The next episode poses to answer some questions....
Erec look like a dam alien when he was crying of embarrassment.... and man that new ending can be miss interpretated in so many ways specially with that dance tha they do..
Great episode "Stand up ED" lol I'd love to see a crossover ep with Gintama and this.
Epic episode!!!! I couldn't stop laughing!! Favorite line: DT to ED "It's up to you now." ROFLMAO
My fave was when Escarlate opened her lizard neck frill lmao.
the new ending is brilliant
I'm getting curious how's this all gonna end...anybody else thought the finger was something else when the ending song began?
I think that was the hidden point of it.
Well, he did that while saying "Stand up, ED!", and the thermal bath episode showed that he has "problems" with "standing up" after DT crushed his beloved treasures XD
@15:32 Upper right corner: Yellow birdy thing looks like Elizabeth. If you're fan of certain anime, you know what what I'm talking about.
GINTAMA.... super Cereal
anyone else see the yellow "erizubesu" doll go flying out the window?
I don't care if this is weird, but I WANT THAT FRILLED LIZARD COSTUME SHE HAD ON......And that face at 18:39....priceless!
The princess looks cute in anything tbh
I lol'd so hard at Erics face. I'm cereal, Super cereal >_<

still miss the old singing from the first twelive
It looks like the next episode will finally give us some answers to this Three Stooges vs the Keystone Kops
