at age 16 she ruined her career? wtf... I don't think that is possible for any career unless you are a piano player and chop off your hands.
I want the ed song for my sing tone.
A good episode. The voice acting improved. I think the regulars got their roles down, but some of the side characters don't seem to have a sense of the mood. But I was able to get into the story anyway. A good episode.
Some of these dub actors need to watch the show, these sought's of animations require a different sort of vocal expression, not to mention some of the characters voices (side characters) don't always fit who their depicting. 5/5 anyway.
