Every fucking character is gonna get a filler! Even Ramen Shop owners' daughter will get a filler!!!

We obviously need to build up Tenten's character before her 1v1 with Madara. But no, in all seriousness, the 'character development' of these fillers is so weak that it's hardly worth the time.


The fillers would not be so bad if they chose better placement. Randomly spitting them into the story is frustrating. I would have loved to know everyone's story as the main story developed not smack dead in the middle of the end
Will my grandchildren, ever live to see the end of this filler?
There was a third exam??? Well, whenever they have a collectors editions I'd like to see some of these fillers, but maybe someone should organize the episodes so these are at the beginning??
there will also be a written test and a practical exam before Naruto gets his license.
Everyone is complaining about filler, and I am sitting here hoping for a Hidden Rain village spin-off
I would pay $$$ for a chronological set of Shippuden, like all the fillers where they should be in sequence.
You just need to have somebody with Rinnegan who can revive you in your 2178 when this filler arch and 3 more have ended ;D
I just noticed ajisai is the summoning pain from when pain attacks the leaf
Its good this show is still going but sad it probably will end soon. it had a good run and many good moments and memory's since Naruto.
You just blew my mind 0.0
She become a summoning jedi!!
IDK why but that broke my heart to find that out...

For being so deep underground, there's a heck of a lot of light
"my team isn't suited for search and rescue" WTF, NEJI = Buyakugan = see through the walls = see them = rescue... this is why filler annoys me.
That is better tracking rather than search AND RESCUE. He searched for her but he wasn't able to rescue her because he would have made the walls caved in and they would of all died like he said. So yeah he has the search part but not rescue
Buyakugan let's Neji see *people* but walls and openings are hard to see. So Buyakugan is little help when finding a route into a maze.
I was completely fine with this filler until they decided to spend twenty years on this portion of it... get back to Gaara already! Also, give us more Fuu! But most of all... Leave this god-forsaken desert already!!!
Not even porn stars get this many fillers....
LOL
Hah
Please end this detour an get back to the main show.
Calling this now, right before the conclusion of the filler (i.e. how they all manage to get that 2nd scroll) we'll go back to the main arc. With 3 weeks of "the story so far". Then go back to the filler just as things get interesting again
lol u realize there are still like 3 - 4 more episodes on the 2nd part of the exam.. then we have part 3 , and then probably fuu getting captured by akutsuki etc. we got a loooooooooonnnnnggg way to go lmao
i much prefer an arc (even a shit one) to how badly they ruined the shows momentum with random fillers, and this way hopefully they buy time to make the main story episodes in much better quality
@3333i, Gaara was the first Jinchuriki to get captured.... so it'll be awhile before she does.
We all knew Ino, Sakura, Chouji was coming. I just expected it two weeks ago.
Right this my current hypothesis for the filler, Ajisai is gonna find Fuu, and they gonna battle it then Ajisai dies but Konan finds out and captures Fuu. End of Filler. Yay!
Not only captures Fuu, but takes Ajisai as a spare body for Pain. Not sure if you've noticed, but she seems to be the body that replaces the animal path that Jiraiya "killed".
I've grown to like Ten-ten a lot more but I just wish she was stronger. Although I guess I wish all the others were quite a bit stronger.
well she can use the sage of six paths weapons for quite a while which is an accomplishment in its own
and using her summoning jutsu for elemental attacks is pretty neat. It's too bad she doesn't really use it more often later on and just sticks with adding more and more weapons.
Ha ha. I don't mind the fillers that much. But they should at least have their own intro. Using the proper intro with Naruto, Sasuke and Madara and then have some idiots wandering around the desert is a cheap shot.

Why is there still filler when the manga is finished?!
Who else just ran the episode in the background to get it out of the new episode queue? Be my guest: 3HJPPPPD6VE

OMG THAT GIRLS IS THE SUMMONER IN THE PATH OF PAIN!

I feel like this filler arc is just for the viewer to revel in TenTen's uselessness and discover that she tried to become stronger (but obviously didn't much from what we've seen.
watch some more filler. I like this better than the previous story. good enough for a guest pass EWVQTM79YD8
Thanks!
