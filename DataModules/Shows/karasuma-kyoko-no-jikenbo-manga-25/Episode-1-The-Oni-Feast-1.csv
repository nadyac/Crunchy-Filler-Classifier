Hi Crunchyroll, I don't know what this is, but it's not Anime. I couldn't make it to the half way point of the first episode it was so bad, and I'll watch bad anime. I hope you are getting these for free and not wasting resources on them.
why cruncyroll
its kinda like a moving manga like MGS PW style
English? Gross. Why do the English voice actors they get always sound terrible?
Seriously all the English VA's are terrible. I bet I could do better.
As soon as I heard "I like your cat" I stopped... hope they upload Japanese version instead later :\
i hear, My god and i quit...
same,didnt even make it 30 seconds, hell only got that far because no one spoke before then
Without fact checking they sound like the team from the "color battle" 2.5 that was released a month or 2 ago
Nope. This is the second fail manga 2.5 I'm curious if they just pulled folks in off the street to do the voice overs.
The story seems interesting but the voices sound so artificial I can't watch till the end...
I don't have an issue with the idea of animating manga per se, but the horrible English VO work kills any desire to watch this. Also, the two-position mouth flapping makes even the lowest budget anime look like a masterpiece by comparison
Yet another example of why I despise most dubbed anime. Terrible, terrible voice acting.
I don't mind dubbed anime, I do mind poor production quality which is more of what this suffers from. The animation, voice acting and production looks hurried and haphazardly put together.
I don't understand the point of this art. If you're just animating the mouth and eyes, I might as well just read the manga if I was actually interested.
Manga 2.5 is for the lazy people who don't want to read.
Common CR just sub it. These dubs just don't fit. The Actors are lifeless, dry and awkward.
"My god!' Sorry, I cant stomach this! I liked some of the other 2.5 stuff, but sorry, i can't even get two minutes into this one.
You guys are overexaggerating things, the dubs are bad, but not as bad as you make them seem. Or maybe its just me, Ive been watching some 90s dubbed anime recently
best dub in history is db for me
Too bad this mini manga series does not have subtitles since I do not care for dubs. I guess I will try the manga itself and hope for an animated series one day. For now, this one goe sback on the CR unwatched by me shelf. ^^
Okay, this is something you hear all the time in dubs, so I'm not criticizing this specifically. Why can't American and Canadian VA's pronounce "kyo" or "ryo" or "ryu"? I'm a native US English speaker and I've never had any problems.
The voice acting wasn't to bad, think the problem was character lines
A highschooler animated series, with decent art, and awful english dubbing. When will you get it through your heads that dubbing is ALWAYS going to be a sub-par piece of garbage?! GET THIS MESS OF THIS SITE!@@@@@@@@@@
You see, CR? This poor individual is so upset that they completely missed the "!" key... D:
I wouldnt say take it off the site, but replace it with better voice acting.
Oh is this like what Marvel has been doing with the animated comics? Kinda lame...-_-
The dubbing for this may be bad but there are a ton of anime that have good, if not better, dubbing then the original. Well, atleast you can see who the weebs are.
I agree, italianodude23. There's a lot of high quality English dubbed anime, but sadly, after watching the first episode, I have to admit this isn't one of them. It seems like they didn't even get to rehearse, but even if it were good, most
of the commentors, here are just plain dub haters. Read most of them admit they stopped watching the instant they heard English. There's no objectivity in their comments. They're just stating their preference. Having said as much as I did,
I think the show is watchable, it's a good story, but the voice acting & even the sound effects can take away from the enjoyment. Whoever is behind this did the show & the voice actors a very bad disservice. They should've let them rehearse
I love English dubs...but this sounds like it was cheaply recorded at a Hong Kong studio or fandub group :x
This is alright
too bad it cant get 2.5 stars
someone...tell me what i just watched please?! D": i did not pay to see this kind of thang!
