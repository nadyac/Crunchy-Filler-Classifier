"You rotten virgin." I couldn't stop laughing xD
couldnt agree more lol
i had to go back 1 minute to watch it again. Kon: "she has Balls" Maid: "Backstabber"
I haven't watched this anime in a while, but watched this episode just for that scene again, lol.
poor Kon TRAPPED between a rock and a HARD place xD
Doesn't matter he had sex.
AND IT FELT SO GOOD!
I like how they deal with the trans thing, I mean, yes it's kind of there as a running gag, but everyones basically like "Yeah, we don't care if she's trans." It only really bothers Kon..
Bunch of trolls that's what this show is, give Marian's balls to ED and everyone would be happy, lol.
indeed that would solve so mutch problems but then ED would not be immune to sneaky ball kicks anymore
He was raped...
The writers in their insulated world consider rape perfectly ok as long as a trannie does it... Don't you love liberal thought process? XP
What what in the butt?
Maybe it's my mind sheltering me, but I don't think they went all the way...
"First time hurting, is a lie." ...That because guys don't bleed you aho!
Marian is an S Class Trap. No joke.
Why do people think anime is intended for children? Then again in America you are "weird" if you watch anything animated as an adult. Animation is not necessarily for kids. Lol tranny focus episode. Anything in this anime NOT innuendo?
As a guy in college who is obsessed with animes (that match my taste), I can say most guys just look at me as a complete and utter dumbass. Then I tell them I'm in engineering and they think I'm a genius. lmao
heh heh in your endo
No joke Seekerhound, I am a welder for Waldon Manufacturing and when my coworkers found out I watched anime all but one gave me the o.O

That ending theme cracks me up every time.
i can't stop myself from fist pumping at the start of every opening when they chant DT
this anime is like watching 4chan. yu got traps, Video games, loitas, rpgs, cosplay, ect.
This show is so strange yet I cant stop watching it
I will say this, if they DID anything, she would be obviously the girl lol. It makes sense cause the first time and hurting applies to girls. Also if she views herself as a girl, she wouldn't want to top. Nothing happened though IMO.
You haven't slept with enough trannies to make that assumption. ;) There's also a whole category of pornography that's pre-op MtF topping 'straight' men. She strikes me as the kind of gal that would like to be in control.
As a MtF Trans myself, i love how they make it so,.....normal, which is all it should be, and shows that there will always be the blind people who really dont understand and in turn lash out over the fact.
gotta feel bad for Kon, I mean damn at that level of trolling lol even if his DT is still intact haha
people that hate kon should stop watching this show if you hate him so much why do you even watch this
I hate him as a character but the show is great. He's even apart of the comedy (like in this episode), that jerkface
I feel stupid because I didn't remember that DT stood for until I was watching something that said the word virgin in Japanese which is "Doutei". It then finally made sense... "Dou Tei" HAH
balls or no balls its love XD
So is he still dt lolz?
he was raped
marian looked better as a guy jussayin
