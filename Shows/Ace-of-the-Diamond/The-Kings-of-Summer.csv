For the 1 trillionth time.....check the preview at the end of the friggin episode and you will know wether next week is or is not recap!!!!! NEXT WEEK IS NOT RECAP YOU DOLT!
@Zimron thats what they want you to think so you will come back for their recap of the recaps O.O
they better have a real season 2 episode next week or I'm dropping this season 2 of recapping season 1.
so did everyone else fast forward to see if it was a recap too?
no just read the comments xD
same just came to check the comments
I saw the star rating and instinctively knew.
same here.. fastforward on phone to check if recap. came here on computer to see comments
not sure why you needed to check, just check the end of the episodes from the week prior and you would know ahead of time.
Ace of the Recap
This many recaps in a row should be illegal...
Of course you know next week will be yet another recap right?
So the guys over at Naruto shippuden should pretty much be condemned for life!! lol
naruto is famous for filler... not recap....
1. naruto = filler and inter episode recap 2. if you would just check to preview for next week you would know that next week is not recap.... you would also have known this week was recap, if you had checked last week.
Next week the new season FINALLY happens! No more recaps!
I hope no one spoils this episode.
The directors of this show really love those journalists.
Are they even going to be of any significance later on?
False Advertising yet again! Season 1 material... Come on. Do better!
this show is so fucking brutal. its pretty good when its not dragged out as hell, now they spend 3 episodes doing a recap?
Brace yourselfs. Real season 2 is comming.
yup, another recap
looks to be the end of the recaps.... thank god.
Guest Pass : 6WNWFD9GZKJ Enjoy :3
You know, I was so happy when I saw this show was continuing so soon after the previous season... guess the joke was on me.
They should have just said that the second season starts on the 27th and that there would be recaps in-between. People probably would have been less annoyed that way.
Luckily it seems like this is the last recap. Thank GOD
There was exactly one interesting moment this episode. At 21:55 the ace pitcher of Teito appears, which will be a new rival school this season. Skip there, then watch the preview, and you're done.
Don't bother. Just a waste of time.
Man, this was painful to have to watch again. They were soooo close!!! :( This new team is really going to have to work hard to be as good as the Seniors.
At least these recap ep's weren't all completely recycled animation! I think.
