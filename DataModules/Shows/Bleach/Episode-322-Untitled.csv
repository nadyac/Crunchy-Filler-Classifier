I'm having trouble picturing a Kenpachi who's even more belligerent than usual.

I wish Kon would get his own gigai or something. He deserves better ;'(
Kon should get a little robot-gigai that has special moves and stuff
i wish ichigo still had the long hair i think it suited him D:
I'm scared of how strong Ichigo's Reigai might be...

isnt it always strange, how ichigo has to protect all these girls? and he does it with a passion too, he's quite the player
To be fair, Yoruichi is one of the biggest badasses in Bleach :p
kayami she has multiple times even if it isnt an episode long or season long thing like ichigo does. (sorry for loss of grammar)

Well keigo was farther away from Aizen, when Tatsuki was right next to him. And also, Keigo seems to have more spiritual power than Tatsuki. Remember how he was able to see the afro soul reaper long before Tatsuki ever could.
Why hasn't Rukia learned bankai yet?
And Ichigo did it in 3 days
LOL @Cynthia123456

Which is part of why Ikkaku's such a bad-ass. He's a third seat and still has bankai <3

"This appears to be a very well conceived plan" it only seems that way because all of the soul reapers are fucking stupid apparently.
That's because being a Captain only involves being powerful and or good at fighting. Intelligence and leadership ability have nothing to do with it. Just like any anime...
I mean look at the squad 12 caption this all went down using his intel and resources. And he is considered to be the most "intelligent" member of the soul society and supposedly has a counter measure for everything! XD
Well to be fair, none of these villains are ordinary at all. The captain of squad 12 is intellegent and all, but it doesn't compare with this villain. Aizen wasn't just ridiculously powerful, he also had godlike foresight.
I love many of the Shinigami in Bleach, but I hate just about everything about Soul Society. Which is kind of the point & pushes the plot along, Seireitei's sheer incompetence needs only 4 highschool kids to save the day, every day.
i love how kyoraku is just laying there humming and smiling in jail, as if he was on a paradise island XD
I wish Rukia had learned bankai by now...
I don't see why soul society needs the 46 geezers.. they never make any good nor smart decisions..
To be honest, they just piss me off.
DUN DUN DUN Plot twist
Guy lost to the retarted shape of his sword lmao
What? The good guys were winning then suddenly it turns out the bad guys are actually winning? I'm shocked that is so out of character for bleach. (Please select a sarcastic tone from the drop down menu before reading this)
Kon is great! why you guys hate him?
This is kinda getting boring without ichigo. i wanna see ichigo with long hair again!!
After what Kira said around 8:40, I realized this was like Pokemon, the first movie. You knoww? :< The clones? Stronger? Ya. :<
the central 46 are annoying
So they're doing this whole double-self thing -again-?
Out of all the Bleach Opening...This by far the BEST ONE!
This show needs a more solid storyline, its getting really anoying.
the reigai r stupid bakas
