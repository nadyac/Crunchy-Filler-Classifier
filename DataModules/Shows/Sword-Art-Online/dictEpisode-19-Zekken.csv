just wouldnt fair used dual sword skills excalibur against yuukiwho only onehanded sword well guess well find out 11 hours cant build proper harem choose winning over over being gentleman truth comes out fair first choice wasnt mass murderer just guilty kidnapping forcible confinement human experimentation develop memorypersonality altering tech so could sell alter asuna jacksonbarber but her parents didnt know any actually knew him small child growing up asuna her childhood friend took advantage because wanted inherit company her dad really enjoyed show until asunas mother showed up now cant watch own parents way too close character here hurts sugou came up asunas mothers response essentially ididntpickhimbutthistimeiswearthisguysnotakidnapperandrapist fact loses her composure seems indicate asuna hit sore spot rapier arc got favorite comes asuna no other arc got into character development quite like one did feel get see whole nother side asuna havent gotten see till now go asuna ;d communicate her true feelings problem goes both ways her mother sat waiting her daughter eat dinner really trying but asuna does not seem make an effort say whats really her mind hopefully theyll real heart heart talk think will clear lot things up between will help her parents truly understand asuna not same person knew before but needs say something apologies essay really dont expect her parents will budge communicates her mind her parents see only child but blissful hell sao added 510 years worth intense lifeexperience asuna felt aincrad best arc because new relation ship between asuna kirito par someone asuna style make remark about angry were her mum not born into rich family then leave by closing door quietly grace while left feeling burned calling your name also forgot stalking weird fetish smelling hair da hell chilled services not pitcher right now lest restraining order freek best guess sugous prison not enjoying himself asunas family would want him suffer plus hed convenient standin target anyone who hated kayaba fact kayaba never arrestedtriedect found kayaba dead his secret residence arrested his wife who keeping him alive through out sao kayaba never captured chose die did some his death no matter circumstances would bring closure but not others general public knew what kirito does also gf not wife why sugou got away things so long imo his family friends asunas family good actor chose hide his true nature smart but not smart thought nothing beats proud look kiritos face asuna finally goes into her top gear this comment removed love asuna told her mom straight out embarrass her parents being poor her mother should know just because married into rich family shouldnt forget where came battle awesome her mother just gold digger all cares about money asuna just reminded her mother where came also asuna more back bone then her mother because her mother leech who only loves money not family seems people simply do not understand culture still lot linearity high school your schools really do determine lot about your opportunities arranged marragies still not uncommon some us understand some extent stuff commonplace accepted some countries but doesnt stop us voicing rather typing our opinions family arranged marriages every generation up until mine trying push too appearantly its about learning love other person sounds crazy but grandparents were together 50 years opening its just damn going an amazing arc yuuki would totally go lesbian asuna perfers her way more than kirito thats all ill say after hanging out yuuki asuna tells her mom imnotintomenanymorep yuuki asuna like way gradually transitioned away excaliber side story opening wee last nice storyboardingdirection itll funny asuna goes lesbian yuuki kirito didnt pull out excalibur so didnt go all out then might think onlynoobsgoalloutforaonehandedskillimadualwieldingprowithabestinslotswordidontneedthatlittleskillp gosh damn arc gonna kill tt can change just upvote changes its happen few times because tablets touchscreen thanks matt784 now upvotted renaryuguus original comment any time also works need give different star rating show will next episode based manga during arc what im really curious see spot will most part anime spot light novel not manga biggest deviation harem feeling fing satisfying this comment removed yeah put bookmarks bar xd proves money cant buy happiness not forever asunas mother clearly cares her daughter which why shes bitch but saidshes still bitch daughter would love someone like kirito also think its really ungrateful her mom dismiss kirito considering got asuna away creepy quasifiance who secretly imprisoning her kirito doesnt an established family name which still very important japan even today too trying get asuna marry someone else like trying light fire water not guy kirito lol someone please give asunas mother bitch slap true enough rx0unicorn even modern western societies yes even us things like your family background can make difference but asunas parents already proved can fooled butterflyboy plus least asunas mother seems determined forgetignore asuna spent two years sao few months prisoner original alo over tenth asunas life spent risking her life death personality well asuna pays her back later rx0unicorn so what slavery existed many generations still does sexual form but wouldnt say thats good right why do think japan one highest youthsuicide rates being common doesnt make right ive read novel man feels already kicking its pretty obvious where season gunna end isnt perhaps least enjoyable arc course alicization will need couple seasons by itself so understandable trying fill out remainder season without really getting into anything substantial alicization will best because some much more like standard rpg will good cant wait refuse believe anyone stronger then kirito sorry thats just fan boying stronger then kirito nope nope nope saw asunas mother behaving treating asuna made so angry get new screen keep large quanitity cheap replaceable screens cupboard coz punched screen cracked must get really expensive feels like parents though mostly grades smile kiritos face calculated lost against zekken asuna fight zekken would choose asuna go merry adventure while kirito can make up lost time sinon lisbeth silica
