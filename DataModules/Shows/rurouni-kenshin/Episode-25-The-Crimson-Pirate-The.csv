What is it about Japanese pirates and thongs?
Kenshin X Kaoru

dammit why did i click show spoiler comment ;-;
y dont the guys work.. it seems like only miss kaoru is workin
I seriously love Kenshin, Sanosuke, Kaoru AND Yahiko. They make such a wicked team. :') Can't get enough of this Anime..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's a little peculiar how Shura has also a manly girl voice. Well, Kenshin's is supposed to be a girly man's voice. In any case, they both sound so similar. xD

dam sano you suck in this ep
Yeah, it was pretty weak how took that lame shot to the ankles. Doesn't seem like something Sano would fall for.
Still waiting for like a really bad-ass villain that is like supposed to be able to end the world and shit,that use his fists.So hes just going to walk up to Sano and be like "WIND TIGER PUNC-*CRACK* OGHMYFCKINGGODHOLYSHIT,OWWWW WATDAFUUUUU
why are anime female characters annoying
12:25 is a repeat of the beginning scene and for those of you wondering, Shura is a hot chick, like any good pirate would be. The battle songs kept making me think about yu-gi-oh: forbidden memories.
Kenshin looked so weak.

I guess you'll be missing the good parts then..
pretty much, first 25 is introduction then it starts getting good.
