Kaito is a massive troll and such a badass
how is he not batman. he's rich, uses gadgets, motivated by dead parent, catching bad guys.
His mom is still alive.
He may not actually be rich. In the pool episode he gambled with the old man's money...well, I suppose we will see.
Batman is drawn better.
Key words "dead parent." In batman, he has two dead parents.
Batman is a douche and has a smaller nose. What's with the beaks on everyone in this anime? They must all be descendants of Pinocchio and pathological liars.
It's okay Kid, not everyone can be good at ice skating. At least your terrible skating managed to work in your favor.
Seiyuu that voiced many of the regular characters in previous Kid adapatations remain the same, but some key ones also changed. Hakuba was Ishida Akira and I wish he was still doing it. Miyano is amazing, but not ideal for Hakuba.
I agree, this style of Miyano's doesn't really have the Hakuba -feeling to it. Hopefully he'll find the right style soon... Of course I loved Ishida's work so I may be a bit biased but still.
okay how did he get the chain underneath?
that rat... kid sent it there just because he wants aoko's dad to look bad.heeheehee xD
she didnt invite her friend?
I find it funny how nobody links "Kaito" (Phantom Thief) to the actual person named "Kaito" lol
he should be researching where he is getting all these custom human sized balloons rather than asking about his favorite sports team...
aw, man... i read the description of this episode first and I was really hoping the detective was Jimmy/Conan. (if you don't know who I'm talking about why are you even watching this...)
The part about classmates should have been the clue that brought the detective's identity to light ;P
yes
Nykidxx this is anime not real life if you don't enjoy the show please go elsewhere, no one likes a hater....
I can make a lot of comments, but the most important one is that, This show is getting more and more ridiculous every episode. Take a hair sample from his hats that he loses every other episode. like sheesh.
Aoko and Kaito, sitting in a tree...
When is he going to take out the white sport car for a spin? Does he like walking or flying by gilder to his heist?
A little behind the scenes trivia: Kaito's VA (Kappei Yamaguchi) did L in Death Note. And Hakuba's did Light. The detective/criminal role reversal is nice.
Pecasso? Really? Sigh, Subtitle fail.
They really make it hard to root for anyone, tbh; Nakamori and Saguru are full of themselves, and then just when I'm cheering for the Kid I remember that he's Kaiba under the hat and just want to smack him one. =(
dudes birthday is one day off from me august 30 1997
lol the trick he used was used on another anime as well ^^
