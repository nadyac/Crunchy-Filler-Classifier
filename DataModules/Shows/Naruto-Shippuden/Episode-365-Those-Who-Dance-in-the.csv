Alternate spoiler title: How Orochimaru got his groove back.



I actually agree with heartfeltdox 100% ( at the risk of a few thumbs down) I have done more back tracking in this series than every metroidvania combined. It was more interesting, and always is more interesting; when characters stay dead
lol so orochimaru is the Ultimate villian in the show not Madara and he shows us that he was just waiting on the side line for his time. Good to see Oro's back!
It's time like these I wonder how Hidan is doing in his little hole.
jiraya sank in the sea where he died at nd Kabuto couldnt get his body due to the pressure at those levels he already mentioned it .... nd orochimaru can be revived from any cursed mark thats on any one student : he came back from Anko's

Omfg I forgot about that guy. Lmao!

is sasuke the one who dance in the shadow while naruto the hokage, the lime light? I would love to see them become leaders leading the leaf.
"Are these calories?" - Choji Oh my dear Choji xD
xD lol I thought that's what he said!
I think the episode where he came back should have been called "Voldemort's Horcrux".
what about kiba's troll: Choji, you're getting bigger
I think that was the first time We've seen some CONCERN on the Faces of Obito and Madara! Yeahhhh, boy. Get em' Naruto!
In this Episode, Naruto becomes a WiFi router.. xD
Linksys no jutsu
Agreed. That comment was awesome and those that agree get to redeem CEM6VYPZANX
omg I never thought about Naruto becoming a router..... good work firebooster you made my day

Well, this show is all about bonds!!

the hokages look so sick

I was pretty sure the 3rd and 4th both used some cursed death jutsu as they died sothey couldn't be reanimated
this gonna be so pimp, ya'll.
that why they had to break the seal with the death mask
Dam! This episode was awesome! Can't wait for the next episode! It is going to get so sick!
Holy shit I want to see a father and son meet up again
R.I.P Neji Eyebrows.... 10:16

She was pretty close to touching that Rasen-Shuriken. I was worried it would hit her.

She was probably my favorite part of this episode! Although I liked it all. VE9NMFB74SJ
Damn i get wait for next week :O
They actually say the 26th, which is 2 weeks from now.. So we should get next weeks, and then have to wait 2 weeks after that.
Yeah, they're wrapping up this series next episode I think! Maybe we'll be lucky enough to get a double bill?! There hasn't been one of those for a loooong time!
hey, how do you check that? the availability notes? cuz I want to kno when there is going to be a two week wait in advance, I hate finding out when Im checking thursday and it says next week. always like WTF!!!!
its below the episode on the right hand side of the screen
hey wackojackmusic I hope you now in the manga theres so much more im not spoiling anything but damn a lot of stuff goes down

Were there ever any better words?

YEAHHHHHHHH! And We're BACK to the 4th Great Ninja War, on this LOVELY Thursday Morning!

Tell that to the opening song.
Next episode (or however many it takes for this to pan out) is going to be fucking amazing.
Welcome dedicated fans!
Right back at You, fellow Shippuden Fan! =D

Dattebayo!

If there are no more fillers Naruto Shippuden will be in the best anime top spot again with what's coming up in the episodes in the manga. Get your eyes ready
unless they but fillers like they usually do
[This comment has been removed]
theres not many flashbacks in the manga but threre will probably be a couple fillers but by the time this seires hits episode 380 390 the manga will be finished especialy at the rate the manga is going
so is anyone else wondering why nobody is even like worried about capitan yamato? even before like the main war started nobody was like "wheres capitan yamato?" haha i miss his wood style jutsu ass
i like the way kurama expresses his pride in naruto, by putting his parents down lol
I'm glad Orochimaru is getting some face-time.
im sick and tired don't feel well...But that can't stop me from enjoying this episode XD
