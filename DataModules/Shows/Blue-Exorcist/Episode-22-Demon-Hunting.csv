So let me get this straight... Mephisto's drawings are worse than Rukia's from Bleach? xD
Da Vinci got nothing on dat
yukio is such a punk and just realized it, so sad I too him till now
Yukio made me soooo mad on this episode. I am watching this series for the 34th time now, and every time I get mad at Yukio.... I sooo agree with you Frostshade....
Bahahah, in THAT case, they must be pretty darned awful! XD
Excuse me sir or ma'am but Rukia's drawing were amazing

hahaha awesome!
Well they kinda look like her. Plus his face is burned up as f*ck if that means anything, @Mellaphone
even if she was their mother that doesn't mean he is their grandfather, still that progressed too fast they should've made it a bit longer so it would sink in.
i absolutely love Mephisto's drawings xD
They were absolutely fantastic, I think he draws better than me.
ummm, is it just me, or do the bars look big enough for rin to slip out. I mean come on that dog wasn't that small rin could slide out side ways lol

anime= defys logic
Mephisto has always been My favorite. <3
If Gehenna is like mirror images, and if you destroy one would it destroy the other?
Better yet, what if Gehenna isn't the reflection?
gasp!
Better yet, what if analogies aren't the best way to explain these two worlds? I think the real concept here is that they are parallel to each other.
Exactly Metal_Monger. You aren't breaking a mirror, you're breaking something more like two blades on a fan. Both blades opposite are balanced, but if you break one, the fan won't spin properly.
...Someone divided by Zero again! XD
yukio a paladin !!?? i can't quit wrap my mind around it......(._.) i kinda want to slap him.
He certainly deserves it more than that Auguste baka...
i hope yukio dies he's the worlds shittiest brother
I hate that grandpa
You and the author is gonna get alot of scolding from Elders this after-noon.
"what the hell has he been smoking" never thought i would hear that in anime other than stuff like samurai champloo
Hahaha, ALWAYS be prepared for anything when watching Anime!
At least Mephisto's drawings are colorful. Lol
AAAHHHH A DEMON WITH....... GLASSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lmfao...XD =D
whats with the sudden burst in plot speed???
Knew some stupid shady shit was about to go down... And Yukio was a dumbass to not think something wasnt suspicious at all
notice how the girls didn't have guns fuck that i would have been like fuck thsi bow and arrow shit gimme the damn gun mofo
Oh god, I really hope that this isn't a 24 episode series :c. I was hoping for a long series where everyone grasps their skills through adventures while we learn about the world D:
Not everyone can be Eichiro Oda

I understand where Yukio is coming from with wanting to protect his brother and all, BUT REALLY?? HE DOESN'T EVEN QUESTION THIS SUPPOSED AND SUDDEN GRANDFATHER OF HIS??
