Poor Klein. It must be tough when your buddy has a five-piece harem and your only love interests are NPCs.
Actually in the novel it explained that he got a contact info card from her.... Hmm weird, the NPCs are controlled by AI and all of the GMs should be on break to.... (wink!)
As admiral ackbar would say "IT'S A TRAP!"
yuah poor klein
15:00
Klein is part of the Harem, but sadly he's the Eunuch guard.
Even Pina looked mad when Sinon was flirting with Kirito. Hahaha
Asuna and Kirito are dating, right? Now here's the thing, how come Asuna didn't gouge out Kirito's eyeballs after that any reasonable Girlfriend would have done it...
@Xplizit, you mean UNreasonable girlfriend. If another girl flirts with a guy who's taken, it's not his fault. Speaking as a girlfriend, I would be annoyed at the girl.
Sinon is quite bold, to do that in front of Asuna. She should know that Kirito & Asuna are an item. Is this a declaration of war, and Kirito's heart is the battlefield? Nah, I think Kirito friend-zoned Sinon with his gallant reply.
you mad, asuna, elizebeth, and (whats-her-name) ? You mad?
OH HELL NO SINON KIRITO IS ASUNAS SO BACK OF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, Sinon has balls for flirting with Kirito in front of Asuna.
He did say it wasn't entirely true ( meaning it was half right half wrong). As for the length of Alicization, well the second part is around around the same length as the first( which was 5 volumes) and the WN did end with Aliciaztion so..
DarkJak2050: true, though usually when people refer to Alicization they refer to part one "Project Alicization". I do wonder if the author would stop where he did during the WN....I do envy the people who read the WN
Kirito X Sacchi, if she hadn't been, we'll call it lost for sensitivity issues, there wouldn't be a harem. after leaving Asuna at the end of the first boss fight he didn't think of her until after the accident when he went to front lines.
@DarkJak2050 - I don't know how far the localization of the novel is done but, I've read up to the 6th volume in the Alicization arc.
FINAL FANTASY SUCKSSS!ALOT!!
"Each time you draw this sword, remember me in your heart." If this was any other anime, everyone would've been trying to hold Asuna back.
Well, not in other anime, but you all know what I mean.
Well on the Novel is different plus next 7 episodes is all about Asuna plus 7 other Light Novels


Having Yui in the party as a boss tracker is basically cheating.
i need Yui for FFXIV and as a personal assistant app on my phone XD that would be so handy.

yep, total Deus Ex Machina
FNAF = "There's about to be a Freddie Jump scare' *Jump happens, Throws CP across room anyway*
Congrats you have unlocked hidden Triple sword skill.
A little One Piece training and he'll be good.
santoryu ftw!
Now we wait for Kirito to turn Excalibur black.
I was actually hoping it transform into the annoying excalibur from soul eater!
Fool!
once you go black...
Excalibuuur! Excalibuuur!
Baka.

Or he could just learn how to use a hammer. Why can't he get hammer skills? It seems like everything else is possible in this MMO...
Not a single point in hammer skills.

Couldn't he just respec his skill points, or is that not even a thing in ALO?
hammer weapon isnt as cool as a samurai and katana though, he should just give it to Liz or something lol

A trap it is... for Klein. XD
I believe that there was a story in Norse Mythology that told of Thor pretending to be Freyja just for the purpose of retrieving his stolen hammer. Shoulda seen that comin', Klein!

Two words to tell Klein: Hideyoshi Kinoshita
[This comment has been removed]

If only I could thumbs-up this more than once! It isn't as if Kirito would be offended, and one less competitor for Asuna! Kirito x Asuna forever!
I ship Klein x Lisbeth.
Yes. Klisbeth.

Nice one.
Yui is like DBM (Deadly Boss Mods) an addon for World of Warcraft.
Being an EverQuest 2 player instead of WoW, ACT (Advanced Combat Tracker) is what she reminded me of hehe!
If quests and bosses are randomly generated, I'd still say it's unfair. Yui has direct access into the system and subverts the unpredictability of the random bosses. It'd be another thing if Thyrm was a recurring boss. Does it bother me? No
well yui is basically a self aware admin npc created by the abnormalities in sao and brought into another virtual reality game. If i'm not mistaken she could probably still "delete" an enemy although there is no point since nobody dies.
Very unlikely she could do a deletion. That's part of what got her detected by the Cardinal system in SAO.
I posted a reply saying the same thing...please don't think I copied him lol.
The secret downside of having a harem: tough on the bank account.

He doesn't use it for himself lol. You'll hardly see it used, most likely.
It's called "character empathy." Look it up.
But not the one from Soul Eater, right?
Fools!
Kirito doesn't have nearly the strength stat to wield Excalibur. Sinon, on the other hand, can shoot it with a magic rope and pull it out of a huge pit single handedly.
i feel like Kirito and Asuna aren't dating but they are ; o ; much mislead from the episodes :[
Didn't they say that Sinon was playing ALO only for 2 weeks after converting from GGO? She probably doesn't know yet. It's not like Kirito and Asuna always does public displays of affection.

Yeah who ever told that was wrong. GGO is the third major arc of the series and Calibur is a simple side story but still canon.
At the end of GGO Sinon was thinking that they were dating But stopped thinking, It was at the dicey caffey As Kirito was explaining how Asuna was holding his hand & the warmth made him remember the Five-Seven. The anime didn't explain well
@tsukuruyatan I think you don't understand what canon means. If it's in the official LN, it's canon.
everyones reaction when Sinon gave Kirito the sword was priceless and way to go Sinon making all the girls jealous.
Everyone was pretty much thinking, "Oh GREAT, now there's ANOTHER ONE" XD
THE HAREM CONTINUES!
I know Klein's feeling.. that moment you get a legendary item and its for a different class.
That's the REAL way to get a legendary, not paying 300 USD to convert gems > gold and buy one off the TP.
bound on use? and since he can't use it...
He could probably use it, Just not be very skilled at it
Agil uses 2 handed axes, not maces. Lizbeth is the mace user.

It's a good thing they have DeadlyBossMods -- err, I mean Yui*
Kirito and Asuna were for all intent and purposes married by the end of the first season and now Asuna has been lumped into the background of an harem and really doesn't play any real role in the story. This bothers me greatly.
Dear Kirito, Please shower Asuna with more love, you manwhore. Love, Everyone
