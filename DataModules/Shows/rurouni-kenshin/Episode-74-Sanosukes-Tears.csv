The first time I've felt anything in this arc...I feel really bad for Sanosuke...poor dude.

thats right believe in kinshin after all he has a cross on his cheek lol.
LOL bear the cross of kinshin!
if sayo dies as this episodes suggest ima be pissed, they better set sanoske with someone after this bs.
He'll always have Megumi... >.> Dat love/hate relationship.
Sayo's love/love relationship is so much better for Sano though >..<

When I hear the start of the Opening Theme, it sounds like I accidentally started an episode of some 70's sitcom like 'Sanford and Son' or something


For some reason Kenshin's eyes seem even more piercing when he is blind.
