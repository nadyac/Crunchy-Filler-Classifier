Such a great series has to come to an end..I hope this gets another season in the future.
Well they also did some episodes that hadn't yet been done in Conan as not all the manga chapters are crossovers. Seeing how the Midnight Crow arc only came out last year after a 2-3 year hiatus, I don't expect any Kaito Kid canon soon.
I do as well, but it will need a hiatus. Gotta say tho, making things very obvious to the viewer but escaping the protagonist has a very old-school cartoon feel to it. Like scooby-doo.
it most be one more sesion he looking for a dimond with a map in and he havent find it so it most be somwere
At the end he said "at the moment the show is over", then he says "lets meet again (sometime)." My translation skills may be bad, but it sounds like a season 2 is possible.
@Visorboy95 is that not most anime, I mean you've watched this anime until eps. 24 clearly you love it so lets be a bit more optimistic about the future of this wonderful show...See you next illusion! =)
The feels...I want another season!
Amazing but I wish more people knew about this anime. It saddens me that this is the last episode but it was my most favorite anime even better than Attack on Titan.
I really had a lot of fun with this show. I'd enjoy another season, but I can be satisfied with it ending here, too. Well done, production team!
awww.. y all the good shows end?
If it's any consolation, all the bad shows end, too.
That's just the way the end of the season goes...Especially a particularly good season like this winter has been.
N-n-next illusion....right?



Naw It's safe to say his mom and dad are Corbeau.
no, it could be that the father did all of it including playing as mom.
There's a good chance that it's both. After all, we did see Corbeau and Harry or w/e at the same time. And also with what Kaito said at the end of the episode about surpassing Kaito Kid, and with his dad adding that last recording too.
Log Horizon, Parasyte, Saekano, then This. It's just too much!
Love this anime and figured give. 8Q9UDLSQGJ5 SUAEFTX89NB L3Q9F9QURC8
What an amazing show this was! Had lots of fun watching every episode. So glad Kid still appears in Detective Conan.
Q_Q I hope Aoyama Gosho seriously adds on to Magic Kaito sometime soon...
I hope this had a good enough following in Japan for Gosho Aoyama to start doing Magic Kaito more frequently.
Need more Kaito. Thank god for his appearances in Conan.
Kept me smiling till the end... and then made me cry so, so hard
Perfect Series. Hope They can make a season 2. Though I wouldn't doubt it.
Love this anime i hope there is a season 2 i hope he will appear on Detective Conan again here are some Guest passes 1.XRHKGX7ZHW3 2.HDUVHYWWFNK
well there are over 800 eps of conan so maybe....?
No there isn't :P Wait another half a year and come back to me
So, then...if Mom is Corbeau's assistant (the one outside the window last ep. and this), then does that mean Harry/Corbeau was Dad? (And if so, what does it mean that he's letting his son pursue dangerous criminals for vengeance?)
What a fun journey this was #BEst anime ever after DxD
I would definitely agree and there is so much more they can do with another season too.
Although they've used up all the manga already, including the really recent special event release stuff (which these last 2 episodes were based on), and this manga has technically been over for more than one decade....
naw the manga is still on-going. Story continues on in Conan and with specials. Like you said the chapter which were these last episodes came out october 2014 which moved the story up. Giving us more insight about his mom n dad.
