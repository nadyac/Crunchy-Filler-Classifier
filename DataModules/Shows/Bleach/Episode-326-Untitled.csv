orihime should heal old man yama's arm so he can have 2 again
I think his spiritual pressure is far to huge for her to be able to do that.
I though her power was to reverse space time? His spiritual pressure shouldn't be a problem. Then again, we wouldn't want Orihime to suddenly become useful.
I think Yama Jii keeps any scar he gets from combat. It's kinda like his pride or something. He probably refused being healed.
seems the shop is not doing so well, Urahara is still using a Commodore 64
Hey, obviously, Urahara is a true classic game/system collector... 'Cuz he's a boss like that. And because he can easily reproduce them. Actually, he could have a really profitable racquet going... $_$
He has probably taken that Commodore and overhauled the shit out of it. I'd say its probably the most powerful computer on the planet if it belongs to that man...
When is Yachiru going to fight??
never...
In the manga
Love how she dodged that attack. It's like a big game to her.
Kageroza is one ugly bastard.
Damn Kageroza you really attacked Toshiro's heart in this episode :/
It's easy... Toshiro is pathetic... and weak minded, he's make a terrible Sith...
Siths are stupid.
anyone else want just ONCE to see the columns of the Seriete (spelling?) fall in a Domino effect from someone's big blast of power? lol
i hate hinamori!!!! she makes hitsugaya make a fool of himself!!! grrrrr
I get it now. All of you calling Toshiro weak are young boys that just don't get what happened there. That actually the most heart warming heroric fight I have ever seen in Bleach. It made me love Toshiro so much more then I already did.
boys if you want the Girls to love you.. BE like Toshiro.. <3 Momo is so lucky.. and GIRLS stop blaming Momo herself!!!... she hasn't even recovered from the Aizen fight! But these Fake Momo's held the real Momo's feelings. She loves him :
I totally don't buy that any guy would be that stupid. It's not cute that he knew at least the first one was a fake and didn't do anything. It's dumb.
Best Beach filler EVER!!!
Bleach,,.
no he obviously meant you fill up on this at the beach
I like it how Komamura ignores Kenpachi and says don't worry about me. Haha then Kenpachi's like hey whose worrying about you
@sandekip: What the hell are you talking about? Have you forgotten the 30 crappy fillers we got during Naruto Shippuden's last season? Just wait... The Fullbringers arc is really nice.
Yoruichi - Yay


Toshiro, get your shit together.
i truly hate momo that stupid whore! i dont care if shes a reigai its not fair for her to team up with another momo!
Gooooooooooooood
@ManZtheLegend Yes they do. So stop telling people to stop telling people not to complain.
