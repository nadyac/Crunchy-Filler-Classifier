Every time i look at the maid i have to tell myself its a guy.
its a trap!!!!
i'd say they where messing with him if not for the guy/girls voice
it's ok as long as there cute.
I hate to admit this but.....The maid would make a pretty cute girl....
BTW that's pretty much online games xD. boy plays as girl char xD
anbody else think when they first saw Erecpyle Dukakis that it said erectile disfunction?
When the doc came in i was hoping hes would say he was a girl. God only gives good looking guys miracles.
haha his balls got cracked
sucks for the dude and his nads, looked like he had been through hell
he will never have kids
I actually knew a dude who lost a nut and had a "prosthetic" to keep him "balanced" as it were.
poor Erec... he's got less balls than Maria now XD
Looooooooooooool
so where did his Dragon boots go? they were so cool looking, and even has a special attack (Dragon NUT BUSTER OF DOOM!!!!)
I'm gonna bet that he accidentally stepped on someone's foot, and the princess determined they were a liability and had them destroyed.
So the show is about a character named DT who hangs out with a tranny and constantly fights ED at every turn. A lot of thought went into this symbolism lol.
ive never felt sympathy for the bad guy in any anime ever... until now
lol funny
Erec no longer, now Erica.
NOTHING WILL EVER SHAKE OUR BALLSINESS.....lol Balls balls balls balls balls.....xD
This is SAO alternate Universe...the lost episodes...on the cutting room floor like...its a fork in the SAO tale...sort of like...what could of happened it the Animators drank more...
Even greater things would happen, you mean?
DT = Virgin and Dimensional transfer. In other words, he hasn't put his "Worm" in the "Hole" yet.
Well... Darn, the hottest guy in the show lost one of his family jewels. D: I don't know how I feel about this. Poor bishie.
IKR i feel so bad for him DX
1...? he lost both lawl
...wonder how long that ipod will last with no charger.....XD......(ends up lasting the whole season) -.- really...
Gintama meets SOA?
Ah, the defeat that lingers after you get kicked in the testicles.
ok we have all these swords and stuff and then..out of no were there's a friggin tank
This show is so funny! I don't think i could ever take it seriously
next ep i'll laugh if he says you don't got the balls to stand up to me LOL
I had to pause it to laugh my ass off when the subordinates were making references to balls and sex.
Damn the second one looked ever more painful than the first
all i can think is ravemaster
