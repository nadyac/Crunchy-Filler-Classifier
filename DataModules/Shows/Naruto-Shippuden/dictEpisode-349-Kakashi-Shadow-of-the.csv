really think just some really big canines already know can smell blood cant shaggy would imply shaved sometimes lol kakashi took off his mask no one would know who under his mask just another mask hes truly dashing~ hatred danzo even greater than before danzo messing things up its more like danzo represents conservative side konoha relies force keep land secure hes more an endsjustifiesthemeans guy agree most comments about danzo but feel hes owed an ounce perspective sandaimes appointed advisor along other decades minato disbanded root not 3rd who turned convenient blind eye man could not agree more sabakunoakatsuki hate danzo so much more than before danzos way solving problems keeping konoha safe caused so many problems caused itachi kill uchihas ended up making sasuke go rogue danzo ended up making kabuto kill his mother now messed up nagato who else thatwoulddefinitelyleaveaholeinyourheart possibly worst choice words one could picked situation why didnt minato seem sad kakashii know didnt see die but still teacher didnt seem really affected by deaths its obviously least while since rins death good while since obitos presumably minato healthy person who knows grieve then move dialogue actually said leaveamarkscarwoundonyourheart hole here just translators being bit cheeky wait what hole heart oh oh oh everytime see ending think poorobito maybe possibly thats why still dont know about madara plans thank spiritwolf15 will learn madaras background mr spiritwolf15 what madara wants force peace upon masses forced peace not peace some people like myself revel chaos take away wrong either way look its wrong show makes love feel bad about villains all rich back stories full twists turns make seem human again except danzo hes just an ass should see gintama then every villain will make cry wanted chaos then madara could just alter genjutsu specifically so perceive chaos world whole point infinite tsukuyomi can create anyones perfect world kakashi anbu gear sharingan badass naruto looks just like his dad acts like his mom did really say kushinas eyes really im watching episode because showing minato kushina need more screen time seriously maybe its because dead dont much screen time naruto looks just like kushina only his colouring common minato 1no im not jelly bruh 2yes actually noticed even saw minatos eyes its obvious its little upward no lot upward much more smaller damnnn kakashi like 10 years old already stared post traumatic stress life shinobi struggle picking up book symptom possible pts why wear mask no ones around wtf hope would reveal his face arc lolol arc actually reinstill hatred everyone danzo ending so badass funny orochimaru said 3rd would puppet 4th danzo gonna try himhe could never contain orochimaru ppeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh havent heard orochimarus voice actor so long sounded unusually more scratchynot exactly remember think orochimaru reason danzo all dang sharingans mistake lol due orochimarus help only first hokages cells not sharingans dont think orochimaru sharingan would keep himself give danzo danzo trash but exciting trash good characterplot development kind trash can danzo just idk dissapear history hes fucked up so much shit superlevelhelper wowwhatd get so wrong chemistry its not like calculus where misunderstand piece an equation get everything wrong by default argument neatly illustrates why dont think right wrong really very useful concepts better think terms conflict interest his reasons ours hopefully win path hell paved good intentions danzo like hitler believed right doesnt change fact his methods results were completely evil lucky all ever learned chemistry teacher cook crystal meth did mr white chem teacher well love dude some awkward moments class though think going through something home best filler series really worth watching why anime not manga why would book same story anime story writers showing creativity such concept lost amongst people lol ppl should just enjoy episode its good not analyze so much whether its content manga not 386chaos its because animes arent known reinterpreting manga use source material however known adding additional content catching up manga jermox deserve all thumbs up although do reinterpret sometimes sucks well one dont care about anything wasnt manga but each own guess funny people down vote comments arent bad but annoyed left good battle filler arc appointment minato fourth hokage bit narutoin him thinking might see very similar looking moment not too far now writers could pull ultimate troll move naruto could sacrifice himself end show dont think itll end naruto becoming hokage but wont die ahhhh danzo go sasuke killed him now feel better least these fillers cooler than ones gave us before least contains information can possibly directly correlate current battle vs obito idk were manga not but still wouldnt label filler irrelevant story aka ramen ninja episode ones damn ostrich very relevant not filler all background story all hinted throughout series now know filler manga may not considered filler anime maybe some previous fillers were good regardless whether its relevant story line its not part manga its filler its part manga its canon pretty simple dont want see danzos stupid face anymore will probably destroy screen do httpiimgurcomt1ry1eqgif like good way kushina so cute though one moment made whole ark even more awesome kushina awesome lol sakura sucks though kidding sakura amazing even kept up manga actually being major help great fighter hinata other handas always completely useless anbu kakashi action finally begun cant wait see yamato well anbu kakashi anbu yamato~ dont forget anbu itachi having narutos voice actor do young guy really not sitting well ears other younger versions cast fit quite well but think an odd choice whenever teen guy talks just hear naruto thats what does sound weird lol didnt actually notice narutos voice actor who did guy haha right neither dont think so think konohamarus voice will ever lessen hate danzoi think not war7c98gpjz lessened after showed his backstory died but now its started flare up again kakashi gave goosebumps end youre not only one
