The look on that guy's face when Kaito's 'dummy' was blowing up!
when chicks start breakin out the handcuffs...
the fun starts.
This show is being underrated. Such a fun show.
I agree this show is wonderful and should get more love. But I believe the fact that the first season being released in spread out manner instead of just released all at once. Is killing this series simulcast appeal.
well its an old anime
You're so cold, like ice cream. But ice cream...is sweet. Gotta love those cheesy Kaito lines.
That feeling when it was the first response I thought of when she said he's cold like ice cream. I don't like fictional characters calling me cheesy.
At least he didn't say "But ice cream is tasty." Maybe he's not quite old enough for that. xD
I love how he was basically, "You're acting all deredere...you must be putting on an act. I wanna see the real Aoko who crabs at me all the time!"
Took the guy 7 episodes to notice his face? All Kaito uses to cover his face is the eye pieces *facepalms*
And Clark Kent uses glasses...
and avoids bright lights
This is the first time Nakamori's had the opportunity to see Kid's face directly.
Those lock-picking skills at the start... Legendary.
Rivals my Skyrim character.

7 episodes later I think the sharp noses are charming.
Is it lame that I found that rollercoaster ride a bit too realistic and freaked out? It brings back bad memories of the Dominator... *shivers*
It wasn't that realistic, his head would have gotten chopped up on that first bump.

i love how close they replicated disney world, i knew what it was even with the fake names
At least they fixed their noses. It isn't as bad as it once was

They're so cute!!!!!
All that sleeping gas that these cops keep inhaling can't be good for their long-term health.
To be fair, Kogoro's been ingesting ungodly amounts of alcohol and tranqs from Conan for nearly 20 years, and he's still as strong as an elephant! XD
Cool. And that place they went to on their date reminded me of Disney Land a bit.
Actually the layout of Tropical Land in both Detective Conan and Magic Kaito resembles that of Tokyo Disney Land's... I believe this is intentional.
If only she knew...lol
I could have done without the magic portion of this show. As well the gags. I was hoping for something more lie detective Conan but from kaito s point of view.
Well, it is /Magic/ Kaito. Also, while it's in the same 'verse as DC, it's actually based on Aoyama's Magic Kaito manga instead, so the tone ends up being different.
Needs more views, people need to remember to vote them 5 stars every episode!!! I'm loving this show more and more every time!! Plus that beat when he's about to "transform."
Mr. Pepper? lol
Cheesy? I think you've got the wrong type of dairy there.
