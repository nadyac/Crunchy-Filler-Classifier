Kaito is the best damn troll period
I don't even have to watch the episode to give that a thumbs up. : )
i agree hes got the nose
we need a second season
we need to put a comma at the end of his sentence...
i honestly cant get enough of this show, i hope they will make multiple seasons
Sorry but the the manga artist said he will only make 24 episodes but there is a movie about coming out this year "Detective Conan vs Kaito kid " and Kaito kid will probably continue with Detective Conan or maybe his gone make anew season
If the first season does well, it's possible.
if this happened in America kid would have been shot by now don't Japanese cops carry guns or at least tasers?
Ah this anime is so good
I really love this show He's got style!
Yup i totally agree!
But of course, a true phantom thief is all about style.
Absolutely! A classic show of stage magic, combined with the farce of bungling cops as an opening act, all absolutely free for the audience (well, except for any crimes Nakamori would have stopped had he not been chasing Kid...)!
Love the opening. One of the best this winter!
I actually like the ending song better.
I really like both openings and endings for once. That's a first for me. Also if you didn't know the singer of this Ed is Galileo Galilee who sang Anohana's Op
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack when Kaito is listening to his prerecorded voice of his father. You know. down by the jukebox.

and try to shoot or taser him don't they carry guns?
I didn't plan on binge watching this series and yet here I am...
Gotta love Jii at the end there.
We all know who the real star is... Keep being awesome, Jii -chan!
Aww, a happy ending for everyone, even Jii.
This is true entertainment.
This show never ceases to amaze me
Kaito is the King of Trolls
Hey you guys do realize that there are older versions of Kaito Kid 1412 and the current version is just being updated for us to enjoy right? Other from that. We all love this series don't we regardless of what they do.
