long live the classics
Aye!
one of the all tme best animes
First time watching this show, and i'm really liking it.
This is one of my all time favorite animes. I love Kenshin!
This is one of the only series which I don't mind re-watching
this is a fine show, it is
What a lol whenever Kenshin pulls Kaoru's ponytail. xD
timeless classic and swordmanship
Gotta love the classics, super cheesy in some spots but still enough for it to be awesome
Kenshin ftw, i'm sooo glade CR got this!
This was one of my first manga series. It's so great to watch the anime again.
A few things from the manga were cut from the latter half minutes of this episode. First, Yahiko BITES Gasuke (who was originally just a random goon) in the crotch. Also, Yahiko's mother was a prostitute who died of syphilis.
such good memories of watching this series (almost 100 eps) and the OVAs over a decade ago! Natsukashii de gozaru!
Bwagh, can't get over Kenshin's female voice actor. Going back to dubbed.
Rurouni Kenshin was one of the first manga I ever read. I loved the artwork and story. I'm finally getting around to watching the anime. It's disorienting hearing Kenshin sound like a woman. Still, I like it.
Looking forward to watching this entire series through again. Been a few years since I last done so. Those of you new to the series best stick with it, cause things get real good as the series progresses.
they don't have to wait, it is already good. It just gets better.
child hood has come back YES!!!!
I alway thought it was funny that Yahiko voiced by the same actress that voices Noa Izumi of Patlabor, Miina Tominaga.
this will be my 3rd time watching this series all the way thru
This series will always have a special place in my heart although I will say that I love the manga even more
