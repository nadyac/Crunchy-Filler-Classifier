I heard you like flashbacks so we put a flashback in your flashback

How could you guys tell if it is bad?
Well this episode was boring. I have a feeling that it won't get much better. Just how many episodes are they going to do, until we get back to the main story? I thought Naruto was going to end soon? I'd be ok with some closure.
he a fat a-s-s
The second half of this episode was redeeming, but still only 3 stars' worth. This arc was so promising with the interactions of Neji and Shikamaru. It had the nostalgic Naruto feel. Then the writers just gave up.

Soooo i herd u liek fillers!
I actually am finding these better than the way over hyped episodes of fighting whats'his'name with each episode containing 10 seconds of actual time filled with grandstanding and introspection.
the filler was good till they got to this fight. every thing in this fight was just poorly done
^ I agree. I was about to be like Team 8 needs to just turn in their headbands now if they can't beat this team. In fact, if Kurenai saw the last episode she'd probably be so mortified she'd see to it herself.
When I saw Hinata in the thumbnail for the last episode, I lost the desire to watch Shippuden. I've now got five episodes to marathon....
60 seconds in i felt like vomitting, this story needs to end ASAP
i think they made shino way to weak this episode too.
Used to be better? They did an entire episode about pee before they jumped to Shippuden. Naruto filler is notoriously bad.
well i like kiba so this was bearable for me....but i agree these fillers are putting a bad taste in my mouth...the only EP that I really enjoyed was the fight between Lee and that other taijutsu guy (dont remember name and 2 lazy 2 check)
I think liking the characters makes filler like this even less enjoyable... There's a point where the characters are so embarassingly, blatantly weakened for the sake of implied character development that I'd prefer not see them at all.
i think there's about 2 episodes of filler left.
Next stage please lets get this thing moving along. We got a war to watch.
I WANT MY WAR!
They've barely even touched Sakura's team since they started this part of the exam, so I think we definitely have a while to go yet.
I haven't watched a single one of them i'm just here to see the preview, and YEP still a filler, and apparently its a Tenten filler now...... great.....
I haven't been watching, either, just check back to see if it's over yet. When you don't want to catch up with the manga it's one thing, but when the manga is finished there's just no excuse for this.
just trying to drag it out.
So Kiba doesn't wash his clothes.
Or his ass either by the look of him lol

It was part of the jutsu.
I am pretty sure I saw two different pairs of scrolls... what the hell is up with that?
Just when I thought it couldn't get worse than last weeks episode, it does. If we have to have fillers at least get to interesting characters, like Fuu. :\
14:38 - Big sweaty ninja don't just fall from the sky you know.
Remember when they said no more fillers this year.
well that was in 2014 now it isnt 2014 anymore so they are gonna put a whole year of fillers out
It'll be 2241 before we see the conclusion to the War.
Even when Naruto isn't there, he still ends up saving everyone.
My opinion is they say the word "Naruto" too much even though Naruto isn't in this filler.
Remember kids, your entire value as a character depends on your ability to tie all your life accomplishments back to Naruto. You can't function without him. smh
Ah Kiba, still thinking you'll be able to catch up to Naruto.
Kiba couldn't beat Naruto even if he fought pre-puberty Naruto.
Is it just me or was kiba dropped on his head at birth?
Several times by the look of it.

I really dont get why they have to keep relating the chuunin exam to naruto. like get your own reason to win, you dont need naruto. Why cant these characters say anything other than "because naruto believes"
Probably because the show is called Naruto. If it was called Leaf Village Chronicles, Naruto would be part of the story instead of the reason we have one at all.
Poor Akamaru gets dragged through endless intense training without a care for his well being because of Kiba's massive inferiority complex.
Wave a dozen donuts in the air and the fat clod will come rolling along to them, end of chase.



I love seeing more about the lifes of the other ninja, just wish they kept it in a seperate titled story, like " Naruto Side Stories" or something like that. That way you can watch the main plot entirely and then on the side watch them.
Shino's way more badass than they've made him in any of this filler arc....
