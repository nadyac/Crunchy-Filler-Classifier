Very deep episode, I feel like I can understand Kakashi better and now I see him and the first couple of episodes of Naruto differently!
That Naruto Picture made me laugh lol
it made my day~!! <3
This is such a beautiful episode. Made me smile so much. Especially lol 20:08-20:23, Kakashi blushing!! I'm so proud his students learned and came back to him. Lightening his heart bit by bit.
i thought he was a weird pervert at first

Woah just realized this. This is episode 360, there are 360 degrees in a circle. We made a full circle right back to the beginning of naruto !
Very nice observation.
Dayum that's....just amazing. This show is even more awesome with this little surprising element
Well that would be to the beginning of Naruto Shippuden not original Naruto.
that pic of naruto LOL
Although they are the symbol of the Nazi party, I believe they were in used far earlier and had nothing to do with their ideals. I could be wrong but I think it is still common place in some cultures.
You are correct. Used in various cultures, usually meaning good fortune. Until the nazis used it, and now most folks only remember the bad imagery. Similarly pentacles were good until flipped vertically and now only seen as demonic.
OMG i want that last pic of naruto as a poster to put on my wall, its too funny! And if you didnt know who he was you might actually think he is scary! (which just makes it funnier to me) lol
The swastika is a symbol traditionally meant for peace, in Hinduism, Buddhism, and the entire world. Hitler hi-jacked it, and used it in a way it was not intentionally meant for. There is a BBC documentary on youtube dicussing it, I believe
That pic was from the 2nd episode of Naruto I think
Not gonna lie. I would totally want Guy Sensei as my Jonin Leader. I can feel the youth from here
With Guy as your leader, you'd never get bored that's for sure.
Lee: "Neji, what does your Byakugan say about his power of youth?!" Neji: "It's over 9000!!"
lols XD
You'd probably feel like you went through navy seal training every day too.
@Cryo_Gen, more like a whole weeks of Navy Seal training, everyday.
I see what they're doing. Now everyone is going to watch the first series now... dammit
If it happens to be the exact same Naruto original episode I'm calling Shenanigans. What would be an easier way to fill time than to have the same episode played again after all.
They will show a different perspective though.
This is actually the final episode of the Naruto Shippuuden series. We are now entering the loop, where next week is episode 1 of the original Naruto series. It will continue infinitely.
If you look at the preview, it's a fresh new animation of the old one. You can tell because the characters look more Shippuden stylised - Sasuke's hair is shorter and all three of their faces are long and thin rather than childish looking
Kakashi is awesome! He has darkness in his heart but he knows he has to do something about it.
@xFloyd Oh my goodness mine too! Had the hots for him since I first started middle school! (I'm now in college, let that sad fact sink in) xD
Did anyone else see Kakashi blush at 20:15? Give a thumbs up if you did.
@ishida617 they did learn a good lesson, but not the one Kakashi wanted them to.
LOL that's a throw back to naruto's wind style training lol. I can see kakashi's beloved comedic side emerging.

Haha! I thought they made Naruto retake that photo. Guess not XD

Those pictures were taken in Ep 2 right after they became Genin before meeting Kakashi in Ep 3/4 ish. Naruto had another picture made later. This must have taken place right after they graduated.
No Naruto did not get another made, they show it in another Ep. with lady Tsunade and/or Shizune looking at Naruto's application pic, saying he should get it re done or something. thou i do not know Ep it was in thou.
Was probably a homage to that moment
I saw Kakashi blush when the kids said they are very graceful or greatful...
Awwww being under guy's guidance looks like so much fun, he is basically a adoptive dad.
Lol! naruto picture
flashback fillers all from kakashi point of view.... restart!!!!
AAAGGGGHHH *child sasuke wakes up* Itachi: and thats why you don't touch my pudding sasuke *eyes go back to normal and smiles*
It's a very deep episode. We get character development on Kakashi. His father committed suicide is what drove him darkness then lost two teammates,it's got worse. It all makes sense why the 3rd Hokage wanted Sasuke, Naruto under him.
Actually, during the chuunin exams, when Sasuke and Gaara fought, Kakashi told Gai that he personally asked the 3rd Hokage to train Sasuke...
But this is to train him personally for the Chuunin Exam AFTER the team had formed
Yeah, if I remember he felt he was suited for it since he was the only Leaf nin left with a sharingan.
The 3rd and Kakashi both wanted Sasuke You all seem to forget that Sasuke was wanted by everyone in the beginning like his first kiss with naruto.
Kakashi is fucking awesome. Those students deserved to fail.
Especially those pricks who were trying to attack each other o.O
They would've gotten an A+ in the Hidden Mist....
I suppose we already know the punchline for next episode, but it would be interesting to see how Kakashi transitions from being cold-hearted to being the mentor he is. We never really do get that in the original Naruto run.
Only one more filler.
You who complain about this Kakashi arc likely never had to suffer the indignity of waiting a whole week to see those 3 kids chase a f#$@ng lost dog in the woods as their mission, and the following week being a clip show!
To be honest.. I want to see more of Itachi's life and Shisui and also the life of the First and Second hokage.
Shisui died pretty young tbh, I don't think there would be much to show. As for the first and second and possibly others.. well, lets not make a spinoff series for every character in naruto shall we?
@castano22 oh? the first hokage and second hmm??? you will get PLENTY of their origin story and madara's origin story and how the leaf was first formed later on. it was a real interesting arc in the manga. can't wait to see it
While that is true, I would've liked to see more on Tobirama's story.
Danzo tried to kill the 3rd Hokage. If anything he's worse than the Uchiha. Why didn't he go extinct with the rest of them?
@Crimsonreignx I understand that its technically filler but as long as nothing contradicts the canon, I think Kishi would probably give this the same status as cannon.Think of it as another pov and expansion of kakashis character.
@crimsonreignx you DO realize that all of this that was shown in this episode has happened right? it is not filler. at all. it has all been talked about and discussed and referenced numerous times. get it right son.
Uh yeah, those things may not be canon, but they fit right in with his style. Also, not all of it was bs. He did give Itachi the ultimatum of killing off the Uchiha to save Sasuke, and even his ties to Orochimaru were real.
@Crimsonreignx You sir have unlocked a Crunchy Roll Achievement-First Viewer To Think That Danzo Has Done Nothing Wrong!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Lol Danzo's crazy he took out the clan so he could put all their sharingans into his arm.
These new episodes are great showing the students growth from a teachers perspective.
And hereeee weeee gooooo!!!!
I like the new Intro, finally some Hinata, Naruto can be really dumb most of the time xD
So... naruto is both? Imo he needs to just choose hinata already, but he's still after sakura even after the bs she pulled when going after sasuke...
As I see it, ever since Sakura tried to cozy up to him in the Land of Iron he hasn't acted "in love" with her. She's still important to him, but he saw the painful truth at that time; that she would only have eyes for Sasuke.
Hinata could've been a really cool character if her entire screentime didn't consist of her swooning at every sighting of Naruto. Her one cool moment was 1v1ing Pain to save Naruto, but he never talked to her about it :/
I think Naruto probably blocked that event out because it struck a nerve in him and he doesn't wanna lose it again lol

Naruto's picture made me laugh, i'd forgotten about that pic. LOL
Wow, it's almost like we're right back where we started. I actually wouldn't mind if we kept going to the Zabuza arc, it's still my favorite.
Let's not get carried away.
I would like to see the Zabuza arc through Kakashi's eyes, but for the love of god, don't do it now. Make a side series or something, but I need them to get back to what is going on with Naruto and Madara and all that.
Madara? who that?
naruto restart! but through kakashi's eyes lol
Naruto restart but without filler and well paced (i.e. without dragging scenes out for the sake of dragging things out)!
