I think I'm in love with the master too haha
I feel bad for whoever gave birth to that guy. o-o
The destruction army reminds me of those guys from trigun
I think I have fallen in love with a man that is 28 years older than me *^*
Yahiko don't care about logic. What is logic in an anime?
i fucking hate this guy he's like Babidi from dragon ball
Will go down in history as my favorite episode of any anime ever. That is all!
Is the voice actor for the midget Juppogatana the same guy as the voice actor for Jakken or whatever from Inuyasha? Sesshoumaru's little cronie guy.
Yes, it's the same voice actor. That would explain why I recognized his voice. XD Also learned that the same voice actor plays the voice of Brook in One Piece. XD
Seijuro is the man!
Such a stupid looking kid of an enemy, although very dangerous and powerful.

Half expected Captain Levi to swoop in during this episode.
the music during the titans scream reminds me of terminator O.o
