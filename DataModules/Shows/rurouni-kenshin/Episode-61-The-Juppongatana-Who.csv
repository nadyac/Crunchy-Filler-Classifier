Episodes 28 to 61 of Rurouni Kenshin = one of the most epic story arcs in any anime ever
wow what a guy he's trying to make a heaven in hell and they were all happy good for them hope they overthrow satan and what not.
I think you mean Enji.
Uhhh.. Shishio taking over hell.. I'm okay with that
Rurouni Sojiro : searching for an answer
This was great I loved how Kenshin was a human who could accept the help of his friends who weren't just plot devices. Good triumphed over evil and the characters were developed. That being said, I want to see a spinoff where hell is at war
Sojiro Seta Wandering Samurai
All Sojiro needs now is a Sakaboto and an anime and it will be badass and if not more than this.
I have to admit, I'd feel perfectly fine if the anime ended here. This episode and the ending theme fit so well together, and the ending of this arc was awesome.
was that butterfly supposed to be symbolic or something
The Japanese view butterflies as souls of the living and the dead. They are considered symbols of joy and longevity. Generally a guardian of sorts. Take it as you will I thought it was representing a guardian of the era but who knows lol
This story arc was pretty good. The only thing I disliked was the whole 'battle arena' ending to the whole thing. Especially since 90% of it was just posturing. But hey, it's a shounen anime, what do you expect? :
I'm glad I watched the first season because it really payed off in the Kyoto Arc. Now I'm done I think.

...Saito!!
It would have served the series well to have a pair of offshoot series of Shishio and Sojiro in the aftermath of this arc... even if one of them is simply attempting to overthrow the Enma from Hell. Oh well... all is left to imagination.
The characters never seized to amuse me.
