possible keksimonsteri book does really good job not letting know mikami reiko so im very happy anime did great job too liked show but never noticed his aunt mikami were same person uhhhhhhhhhhh what guys last episode ms mikami died teacher one after sendthedeadbacktodeath then students came out kill mei but killed but theres realy what heck possible dead didnt die moment just wounded done so would suspect her less thought already dead calamity didnt stop though could also see her walking around after building burst into flames either felt really stupid ;x dont think looked alike all mean hair color diffrent did die her hair every morning before class then wash off before saw her his grandparents house holy shit chromosomes restored ten seconds finished reading these comments none guys seen movie backdraft think kurt russel 90s sheeeeez ya also dont forget about back drafts flashovers mean reality all would died build by michael bay misaki should become class three teacher problem solved long time ihatebeingquestioned dont think shes cut out being teacher this comment removed calamity continues long dead person take up extra spot considering frequent death place calamity aint goin nowhere but then shed go through process consent kill student do realize hard itd convince parents child already dead wouldnt consent just kill student parents wouldnt remember kid real memories would return thisisnotnormal man badass teacher 15 years ago known about tape who whole time now why didnt stop wouldnt known because person killed never remembered because dead person also person who made tape hid so no way librarian would known teacher 26 years ago believe teachers name 15 years ago kouga something like mentioned couple episodes back field trip being explained believe first part tape thinking more along lines captainobvious teacher commits suicide front class nope still normal thisisnotnormal understatement year no understatement century actually sniper noticed right killed reiko went like frames shot his rib cage lungs then jumped zoomed out shot shows him collapsing holding his chest does anything misaki do make any sense also anybody who seeing thisask urself class cursedshould go any future feild trips asked ur self then think why am laughing kouichi probably just running adrenaline its too bad red haired girl died only wanted remembered but couldnt happen cuz reiko died year memories altered who knows mb will remember her later am only one watched last little clip after credits must mean remember what happened either also remember reiko realized someone must died who extra decided share fact thats stop curse saw always wait till end because anime likes add scenes after credits think only people personally involved remember mei kouichi probably remembered everything happened its only said dead person forgotten not events though probably will forget some point youre right did look like sakakibara perhaps killer his father fled country after murdering reiko thus explaining why truly india whole time this comment removed yukito ayatsuji needs hurry up writing another no its another another escape thy chandelier; by pillar thee suffer oh man pillar falling guy beginning made lol xd im free squush haha one made laugh too imgoingtomakeitoutalive lol nope ikr this comment removed turns around look fallen chandelier killed other classmates doesnt check any tries save himself crushed brutally help people looked like kouichi killed reiko past oo this comment removed dad since never saw him idk about killer but dad said kouichi year half ago his memories werent altered since india werent so irresponsible signal area werent so bad actually dad asks about year half ago kouichi corrects him hadnt time dad all like oh yeh yer right man india hot hangs up quite an interesting theory his dad killer find entirely possibly but will most likely never know guess its just one those things writer leaves reader coincidence no one anime sense urgency who just walks through burning building filled psychopathic killers koichi stood middle room fire his cell phone 10 minutes xd koichi even brushed off piece wood caught fire off his shoulder like nothing lol so do mei koichi hook up what apparently writer making spinoff sequel so fingers crossed people guys so thirsty xd well 19982013 15 years so would almost 30 kind like aunt guy who accidentally killed another 13 years earlier creepy wouldnt funny right then his dad called him complain about hot india lmao maybe call about heat foreshadowment call end fire anyone
