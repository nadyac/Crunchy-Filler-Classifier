recap end 2:18
thanks
thanks brahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
lol at comments saying these fights suck, fights should be short and quick, they are fricken soul reapers, not dbz warriors. Byakuya was fricken boss in this episode
Finally, Someone speaking the truth!
Byakuya shouldn't even have had so much trouble with Tsukishima to begin with.
Tsukishima is just beastly with his ability so Byakuya had a tough time, but Tsukishima is a human so he has limits. If Tsukishima had taken some of Ichigo's powers he would of won the fight.
I disagree at any rate he would still have lost the fight, you forget that Captains only use a small % of there power for fear of destroying the Human World. He would have still won because he is holding back most of his energy,
I've gotta agree with GamerRaf...Plus Byakuya is My Boy...I can't down Him! For those of You who think Tsukishima is a walk in the park, I beg to differ!
dchompy : it wasn't his first time using his bankai. byakuga also used it on the ye control guy arrancar. who were about to finish of rukia. he uses it more frequently after coming to sense after ichigo's encounter.
Just here to make the comment chain even longer
tsukishima is hundreds of years too early to challenge byakuya...literally
Byakuya is the only one who is so bad ass that he can literally just ignore Tsukishima's hax
That's the Head of Kuchiki clan for You! =D
I started clapping at the end of this episode alone in my room. and it was so epic i still don't feel stupid for it.
ahahhaah I feel you .
I do that all the time, My Friend! Like the other Day, the new No Game, No Life...at the End I jumped up and shouted WHOO and started clapping. Haha, it was awesome.

omg rukia, you're so funny... ahahahaha, she wont cut the toy! YEAH byakuya, you did it!! <3 the 2 siblings in action.
I still wonder.. Zaraki vs Byakuya... Who would win?
Zaraki would.
it would be a tie they would both die as space implodes around them.
kenpachi, i'ts been said. blow for blow kenpachi would fuck anyone up. byakuya's lil scratches would not effect kenpachi's epic badass
the only fight they had was in wuako mundo or las noches but that was more of an arguement then a fight lol while they were epicly screwing Yami up
Even though Byakuya is My Boy, if (when) Zaraki gains Bankai...Wow.
OMG!! Rukia is sooo CUTE!!!! And Byakuya learned something new. As cheesy as that is, that was a good episode, but I'm still worried about Rukia.
11:04 Rukia's thoughts: "The only thing I regret after these turn of events is...THAT IM GOING TO DIE" XD
tfs
he means Team Four Star, the makers of an abridged dragon ball z series and that was a reference
kon should have come in to save rukia
That would've been nice. XD
Rukia x Kon. X3
I never thought I'd hear Byakuya say he enjoyed a battle
after bleach returns from its break (its not ending) i wouldnt mind seeing a filler on what soul society did during the 17 months after aizen's defeat

so.... who does anything other than click on bleach and naruto here?
ME! Crunchyroll was made for anime not Bleach,DBZ,Naruto and one peice alone it was made for ANIME EVERYWHERE ( except for hentai we leave that to XXX sites )
I wish dbz was on here.
Byakuya and tsukishima has some similarities. the way they talk and act but byakuya is my man for now! LOL
why is it that just when things are getting really sick and the characters are all leveled up, the show ends!! I am so sad T.T
You guys need to study ur bleach facts the episodes are temporarily suspended so the manga can get ahead of the anime again it was catching up to fast tite kubo wants to continue bleach for another five years it will be back in like sept.
I don't know if you read the Manga, but i do. I know what you mean by this.. It's been Months and they're still in the same Arc.. It's gonna take awhile for it be completed..
haha rukia looks like kon little bit
Fights are short because the enemies are WEAK. Why? 1. They're human. Soul Reapers can withstand hits and injuries better than a human. 2. Ya'll got too comfy with the UBER LONG Aizen fights XD
lol rukia and her soft spot for cute things
