have to say this is one of the best episodes since the tailed beast fight. nonstop fighting, and kakashi is a true genius haha




Lol obviously half of the people that replied to this comment.. dude....Great Ninja War 1..? No.. Just stop.
kakashi's heavy breathing really sells his disbelief
He ends up getting used by madara obito=nagato all over again
he is also the one who helped itachi kill of his clansmen right so he could have got some sharingan from there too

hmm... obito letters rearranged is close to tobi... hmm... right eye hole only mask from when he lost his left eye.. tobi has the same dimensional space as the obito eye kakashi got... seems likely.
Don't forget that Tobi was able to get Deidara's arm that Kakashi warped away.
the next episode, omg im gonna go all nuts when that mask is off.
It's Tobi, he's a good boy.
Yeah i remember him lol pretty old
lol we all know who it is they've already explained it an now kakashi confirms who it is now that he realizes that there eyes are linked

Even the name is almost the same.
That Nine Tail Smile, So cute!!!
Adorable and scary at the same time.
The beginning had me tearing up
now finally getting to the manga catching up
The nine tails flapping its ears at naruto!! if that isn't adorable I don't know what is.
@ericosan The only thing more adorable would be chibi nine tails doing it
Here we go! Best part of the week!!!
Merry christmas Guys


NO! DON'T SPOIL IT FOR THE OTHERS!
If you still don't know who Tobi is then i gotta say you're kinda slow. There have been soo many hints, but seeing kakashi's reaction to the "kanabi bridge" part and that their eyes are linked, the answer should seem obvious by now lol!
I always tell myself "wait a month, that way you will have a bunch of new episodes to watch" But here I am at 3 am in the morning watching what seemed like a 2 minute episode.
same here!!
OMFG THIS EP IS AWESOME FROM START TO END
Who else went wtf at the first few minutes of this episode? I thought I was watching an old episode but then I couldn't recall that opening scene. Nevertheless, it was a great addition.
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE NEXT WEEK'S EPISODE !
NAOOOOO!!! They can't end it like that! Why isn't it a double feature this week? AARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!
They skipped a week a while back so there should be a double header coming up sometime in the near future.
whooo next week and for you anime lovers if you dont have a clue who the guy behind the mask is you'l get a surprise next week or that following weeks episode they gave you many hint who the person could be in this episode

Oh well, do your best to get psyched up again.

Im like a kid in a candy store i couldn't wait so i looked it up =/ haha im ashamed hahaha
Can't believe I didn't make the connection between Kakashi's vortex and Tobi's until now...but that's the clue

Sometimes I think Naruto is gonna end with Naruto as Hokage just throwing up a peace sign saying "BELIEVE IT!" with a huge smile on his face.
no it would be "BELIEVE IT, YA KNOW?".
I like "Ya know?" more so than "Believe it!"
"Ya know?" is better

shikamaru's gonna become hokage and in his depression, naruto is gonna get a job at ramen ichiraku. and then we'll get a new spinoff "the ex-hokage candidate is a part timer"
Badass introduction... Made me want to go outside and jump off a building. I think i'll finish this first though.
awesome!!!!
Hooray for the revelation!

super ep great way t do a build up
