I'm not saying I like Kaoru, but I don't see why people hate her so much. Sure she's not the greatest female lead ever *cough*Balsa*cough* but she's not awful either.
One of my favorite episodes~ <3
that it is...

I like Kaoru.... I think, and I'm pretty sure Watsuki agrees, that she's not quite portrayed the way he intended though.
The song is "1/2" right? .. Like 1/2 glad that Kaoru and Yahiko went to Kyoto?
At first I was worried but now if Misao learns the truth in this way from her new friends I don't believe she will turn against Kenshin anymore, especially since she knows Kenshin is nice and if Aoshi is after him then the evil one is him.

I was with Misao in the beginning - nevermind the fate of the nation, nevermind that she's endangering herself and Kenshin - nope, Kaoru just HAS to see him. O.o And what is she going to do after that? Just get in the way, I'm sure.
I expected the master to at least have greying hair and a few wrinkles..
PSH NOT Seijuro Hiko!!
One of the secret techniques of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu is to slow the aging process so the swordsman is always at his peak performance.
GAHHH!!!! Commercials come at the best parts and worst times!!!
Shanks!!
NETERO SAMA
Good thing classes don't start for another week....can't stop watching!
One of the best episodes ever.
Great episode
the "dramatic music" gets annoying and repetitive.
