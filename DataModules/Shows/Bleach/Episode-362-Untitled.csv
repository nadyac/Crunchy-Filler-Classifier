Loki: I have an army! Stark: We have a Hulk. Ichigo: We have Kenpachi.
Kenpachi was awarded - Drawn First Blood, Insta-Kill, Badass, ect...
Flawless Victory!
No mullet = No power
...I don't remember that from the movie....
Bring an army, bring ten armies! Throw those damn watchers back into the abyss!
"Hold on a sec Kuchiki. That one looks stronger. Switch with me." XD OMFG Kenpachi!! At a time like this...
Actually Kenpachi couldn't even scratch Alucard. That damn bastard is omnipresent and intangible
Gin....
Alucard couldnt scratch kenpachi because Alucard doesnt have the right power or weapons for that
bitch alucard is immortal

Recap over 3:19
LOL I love it when annoying bastards are cocky and get owned really really hard. I just find it really hilarious
Yes, I missed Kenpachi.
Super geezer gains 9000 total health points! Kenpachi overkills for 99,999 damage!
LMAO! "Hold on Kuchiki. That one looks stronger. Switch with me!"
lol typical Kenpachi.
Poor Orihime loves Ichigo so much that even in that sword cant tell her not to.
That guy is a disgrace to The Hulk.
awww that makes me happy they finally care for ichigo for all he done for them
"What a bore..." Kenpachi is a boss.
OMG BLEACH AWESSOOMMMEE!
Fuck yeah it is
all their new hairstyles looks so much better than before =D
Seems like the Opening sounds a lot lighter than the other previous episodes
Kenpachi, too funny! :}
Hulk King Bradley SMASH the MADAO, Kenpachi STFU slash
OMFG CANT WAIT TO SEE IF ICHIGO CAN STILL USE HIS BANKAI GONNA BE EPIC IF HE STILL CAN AND THEN USE HIS FULLBRING ON TOP OF THAT!!!
FULLBRING REMOVE remember

As much as I love Ichigo's bankai, it's nice seeing him fight in Shikai every now and again
Ya but not for the very final episodes
Orihima: Oh good they all came to stop Ichigo. Chad: But why does it look like their on his side? Me: omfg I wanna take a bullet to the head just because of this...
