it's a good thing that Yukino know's how to fight since she can't use her celestial spirits and dam can she fight go Yukino!!
@DeathByEsdeath there are no japanese subtitles. Who would make japanese subtitles for a show with japanese dubbing? The settings only show No Subtitles and English Subtitles (by right-clicking)
@DeathByEsdeath Why do you say Nihongo? Is that necessary or is that according to keikaku (keikaku means plan)?
@romdream Who? Those that serve deaf and hard-of-hearing Japanese, of course! Unfortunately, I don't think CR has the rights to those in this case. Let's be thankful that we have lyrics for the OP and ED themes.
Not sure about Japan, but all broadcasting in China and Taiwan are subtitled due to regional dialects.
i know right
Hey there natsu, Did it hurt? when you fell from heaven?
Ha! He got dropped into a pickup line! I can hear the fangirls screaming.
lol
lol
i dunno about natsu, but my ribs sure hurt
No, but it sure hurt when I crawled up from hell (the response to that one: That must be why you're so hot)

and no one even tries to find out if there is another use for the globe either...
Because those ALWAYS end well
@shadowsWalking agreed
lol
I'm conflicted on which version of Virgo I like more, but if someone asked....Yes.
Choosing between Virgo, S... or M? Silly @Jeffbucc, you don't have to be conflicted; the term is S&M! Gotta have both!
gotta love her, she's a switch!!
Aight so then here's this question should I be concerned if her dialogue got to me?
@crsed now that's concerning

Yes!! These characters are so useless!
And so follows the story of how Fairy Tail was permanently banned from the Magic Library.
Fairy Tail members don't care for permabans. Laxus came back, didn't he?
I hope the Magic Library is self restoring.
Fairy Tail Friday...
And now the wait for next week begins...
Saturday morning in Australia
im starting to enjoy the new ending than the opening it's really catchy.
Whoa, Yukino and her fists...
Yeah and the Old version of Virgo would have said, " Thank you may I have Another ? "

Well she is pretty handy with her whip so she isn't at a total loss for defense, this is the most hands on fighting action we have ever seen from her I think...(they grow up so fast)
I swear this episode feels like it's 50% NaLu. Like, every sentence out of Natsu's mouth is like ship tease
i have to say its pretty stupid to find an item the spirits are looking for when they can't find it knowing they are going to snatch it away when you do find it.
It wasn't can't find...... It was haven't found it yet
Damn !!! Yukino came out swinging with the Ass Kickin' equivalence of Razor blades and Lemon juice !!! Major improvement from when she was humiliated and booted out of Sabertooth during the Games.
Virgo reminds me of Esdeath
Salty people downvoting your ever-present first posts.
Wanted to see Natsu go serious mode, guess it can't happen all the time, gotta take a beating and get back up stronger.
That tiny ass book Taurus was using the hell is made of. It block all of Natsu's attacks.
I was wondering about that book too, I guess there's magic like that in the celestial world
Ah Natsu, just recklessly jumping into action without listening to Erza's instructions. He's in for an Erza beating in the near future.
Let's be honest here; when it comes to Lucy, Natsu will do anything to make her happy, even defying Erza's or the Master's orders.
Good point.
He's even more reckless than Luf~ -- I mean Lucy. From Edolas. Yeah, let's go with that.
I'm glad Natsu spent the time during Erza's orders thinking about how to get to the celestial world and asking Master Crux to bring him there *poof* Natsu would had destroyed the Library more than Virgo did
I know I shouldn't, but I feel a little more proud over the fact that my zodiac sign is no longer represented by a pervy cow... >>' No matter how temporary it may be. ^^'
thumbs up for extended Levy screen time
Hopefully they explain why they forgot their memories and why they decided to rebel and try to achieve perfect freedom. If not then Loke is a douche.
Natsu didn't listen to a word that was said. Surprise.
