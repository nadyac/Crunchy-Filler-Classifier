2:34 end of recap
Why is Orihime still in Yukio's game world? What the... Chad looks even bigger oO
What is up with the drawing in the episode... everyone is really skinny and super tall..
Is it just me or is Chad talking more and more the deeper we get into the series?
By the time this episodes over Chads gona sound like Barry White..

well they do have to grow
@hollamondw Even in the best arcs Bleach's plot has always been paper thin.
Tsukishimas true identity? Criss Angel - He mindfreaks people.
I liked her old hairstyle, now she looks dopey like Rangiku. Anyone else notice how the boobs in this show are either flat as a washboard, or the size of a prize-winning ham? The 2 extremes!
well i dont thing prize winning hams were that cose but i think maybewater melons hehe but idk about the flat washboards maybe a little hill but not flat completely
Riruka and Tatsuki would probably disagree with that.
I like Orihime's new style
inoue makes me fullbring!!!
when they were 15 they were close to being 7 footers. now that they are 17 they are all close to yao ming level. of course chad already surpassed yao he s now in manute bol stage.
Incomplete fullbring definitely looked way better than the complete one.
ikr
riruka only eats donuts...and orihime eats a hot dog for breakfast. how are they not fat??
Food directly into boobs.
lol
That's anime for ya.
She's probably pushing 200 with all that boobage. And dat ass!
I like Tatsuki but I really wish they would cut off that damn mullet they gave her xD
I think she looks better with it.
2:34 recap end
how the hell is a hot dog breakfast?? O_o
With maple syrup and eggs!
I love this new full-bringer stuff,I can't wait until we see what Ichigo's Dad,Rukia and Uruhara are doing.
can people shut up about the manga who cares seriously if is not the same or not... also fckin idiots that post spoiler about the anime fck u why cant people stfu and enjoy the damn anime for fck sake
@v0xtheriot The fat goes to their boobs.
My god,compare to the beginning of the series Orihime's boobs are..........DAMN.I can't stop looking at them.They became Rangiku's. Anyway,like the extra stuff they're adding,it's expands the arc beyond the manga.
ah, tsukishima and his mind rape powers
i still think people should watch demon king even tho its only 12 episodes
Demon King Daimao, AWESOME!
Why are you mentioning demon king as a comment to Bleach?
at 13:30 Chad was so tall they couldn't put the drop of sweat on his head, so they put it on his shoulder LOL
The frustrating thing is... I bet any one of the captains could destroy this guy, hell, I bet Omaeda could...

i mean we know aizen is still alive he just got sent to prison for 20,000 years lol
