Next week, we will be visiting why Naruto got a splinter 15 years ago.

error code 404: continuation of main plot not found....
^ LOL that
@ Rekkaba: were you intentionally saving that comment for the 404th episode? LOL
I'd be lying if I said no. Thought it up back near the start of all these fillers, saw that we were nearing the 400s and decided that if they made it to episode 404 then "Bam!"
Damn you know it's bad when tenten gets her own episode
You know its bad when Tenten's episode is turning out to be better then Hinata's...
@Najja To be fair the last couple of weeks have been more of Kiba's episodes.
Kiba: NARUTO!! Tell me what I should do! Naruto: You do know I'm not really here right?
Aww... I think Tenten deserves more screentime, though. I really like her, myself. Though, she does seem to be better suited to mainly tsukkomi like in Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth XD.
FILLER C-C-COMBO!!
they plan for the anime to finish up by the end of the year i think
@ShadowsWalking There are fillers so they can have more time to put extra special time into the final episodes, you won't want the final episodes to have the quality of this level would you?
@SimpleEnjoyer That has nothing to do with it. They're buffing the schedule so the series can finish out at the end of the year in the fall season. Of course they'd want to continue making money for an extra six months.
I really don't mind this filler its pretty good
It's certainly not as mind-bendingly bad as some Naruto filler (wish I could get those years back). It equates to a period that happened and will probably never be covered in the manga. It's filler, but as close to real as it probably can.
Hmm... Not half bad. I was expecting something like last week. Thank god that wasn't the case. Also, Tenten wishes to have more screen time.
I'm glad of seeing some Tenten, a bit more interesting then the last group. Tenten was not used enough in the series.
very true not the best but much better than last weeks haha
Tell Tenten that this isn't Gintama, so suck it up.
All she really lacks is one of the Hidden Rain shinobi's umbrellas and red hair.
The best part of this filler is that Neji is still alive, every time I see him I get kinda sad knowing what awaits him.
am at the point were i dont remember were the main story is anymore
So hard to go back and re-watch, huh? Well, Kurama gave Gara a plan to save Naruto after Naruto got Kurama pulled out of him, and they went off. Sasuke is trapped and helpless beside Madara on top of the statue, while ...
Kakashi and Guy are fighting Zetsu. Orochimaru and his group are running towards Sasuke, and the main fighting force is in front of the thousand hand statue (with the other Zetsu on top asking what pooping feels like). Some unknown person..
Some unknown person steps up to where Sasuke is and they aren't revealed. Garra, Sakura, and unconscious/dead Naruto are flying on sand to where Kakashi and Minato are (I messed up, Guy is at the Gedo statue) ... but still, suspense point.
Oh god, this all started because Son Goku had to ask Gaara about their friendship.
Omg I wonder if Tenten will be ok!! I mean it's not like this is a prequel and we already know the answer or anything like that. The tension is killing me!!
Na shes dies, the one in the war is just a clone they made using some Tech developed by orochimaru.
TV Tokyo! Enough with the fillers! PLEASE! PLEEEEASE!
I want the fillers to stop. I want to finish this once and or all. I wan to watch the last movie.
If you want the story, read the manga. Since i already know everything that happens in the main story, Filler is the only thing i enjoy watching.
I appreciate fillers that create new stories within the universe, like OVAs or movies. But fillers that try to re-tell or try to open up arcs that have already played out, that's just lazy and clearly being done to milk the franchise.
Wasn't this filler suppose to be about gaara remembering how he became the Kaze Kage? When did everyone from the leaf village appear? How does he remember/ know any of this? Logic completely thrown off by so many fillers. smh
I actually really enjoyed this episode. I wouldn't mind if it kept going.
Hmmm, only Kakashi would regularly climb a cliff with one arm like it's a walk in the park.
Yo, we know you like filler, so we put some filler in your filler so you can hate while you hate.
404: Error "TenTens problems" not found
Well this was much better than the last couple of episodes, no enemy with sweat and belch jutsu and even if it was brief it had Kakashi being cool.
Seems Tenten is the "Sakura" of this team.
you only just realised that all the female characters in the teams are sakura like except hinata
Well Hinata used to be in the same boat.
The Hinata filler was nice and short
Isn't that hidden rain girl one of Pain of six path, who's using summons?
nah, summon's girl like one of the followers. did you see the scene where Pain girl with wings tells Ajisai and her team to go take the exams?
Will you all just shut up? I get it, you all want the fillers to end. But the longer the filler is, the more time they have to work on the the awesome fights to come in the main story. So at least try to enjoy what your getting.
I swear they made this episode because people were talking about how convenient her mile-long ladder was. Maybe she can summon us a better filler episode!
FILLER BELIEVE IT!
Lol. the generic leaf team at the beginning of the episode is terrible. They didn't even give them different clothes, they're all earth-colored, and they have no key physical features = they'll die soon. Filler team within filler flashback.
What happened to opening the hidden gates hurting your body a great deal? Lee seems to do it without any consequences now.
If I made any show that reached 404 in today's world.. I'd have to insert a "not found" joke...
I always wanted to know more about Ajisai
