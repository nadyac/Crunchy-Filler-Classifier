little bit close youveonlybeenplayingfor2weeksandyouwantalegendaryweapon youbetyourfuckinassidoiwannashootpeoplefromamileaway think new character wouldnt transfer her ggo char yeah its specifically stated novel did not transfer her character ggo but made new character scratch no excalibur will ever surpass souls eaters excaliburbaka this comment removed kirito could bring sword gunfight then sinon can bring bow magicfight something like sees jellyphant yells out appayipyip its avatar animated cartoon no spoke avatar last airbender dude just made day im so happy haha glad im not only one who thought avatar last airbender arc just side story ln but want make an entire arc out im down just long dont skimp mothers rosario sure same hope so too wish didnt do side story but itll give some more screen time sinon least who doesnt really show up next arc this comment removed now look back what said think enough material two more seasons assuming each season four novels asuna great wife kirito obviously doesnt problem him grabbing some tail every now then whole thread tail its own yeah agree didnt realize sinon first this comment removed fair knows kiritos heart fixed her anyway so why would mind much this comment removed looks amazing cant wait next episode but hope klein gets more screen time because seems cut him off lot am sure klein will show his badassness redditcomronetrueklein this comment removed well least made klein compensate his lack screentime by using him hollow fragment kirito first rule about nekos dont pull tail lol typical kirito ask yui rides motha fkin dragon his relationship asuna solid enough isnt jealous type so get kirito feeling secure enough flirt seen sort thing real life too poor klein but wouldnt first guy younger girlfriend asuna one those open girlfriends why would someone who knows loved jealous about something silly think asuna great because apparently doesnt care kirito equipping his second sword like ash turning his hat backwards shit going get real this comment removed dont compare him ash just bad analogy iwanttoseekiritobeforeireturntokyoto oh trust would want see too seeing what were did go bed together ala 165 just behind scenes youll notice anime asuna naked least topless bed after underwear incident yep series simply did not show action were clearly did spend night together worth noting sao hf its heavily suggested kirito bangs asuna one side events this comment removed what sao hf damn want bathroom like asunas dont want one like want one one asuna bubam just want asuna asuna gorgeous though no denying dont get why do episode 145 recap about start new unrelated story arc anyway easy filler cheap screentime pad out series guess least sao filler 34 episodes rather than other anime filler 23498757 effing episodes little sarcastic exaggeration seems seed having some pretty interesting affects mmo games behind scenes wonder part what kiayaba up by giving his pet program kirito idiots who think filler dont get recaps work japan seeing asuna nake bath totally necessary mean could not live asuna fanservice yes yes an attempt make up mostly leaving her out last arc shame anyone who started shipping sinon lol screw asuna all about silica fair did say cant fly its not conspicuous nyrb right cant fly down only thing thats visible tip pyramid can only really see youre high up 017 kirito starts his morning cup tea somebody found excalibur fool bakame nude asuna bathing within first minutes yes do approve yes wish every time did quests 80% group would females damn kirito alpha male pretty common city heroes since most guys would rather watch third person female avatar tights run around screen both sorta cool world forces gender matching avatars same destiny someone other than remembers city heroes god also need make game much character options coh approve these coh comments dammit now guys made want play again hope deal goes through soon hype new season show asuna nude bath scene kirito pulling sinons tail yup going one great season bad an arc your way burger king after opening credit scenes cant tell music playing isnt inspired by chrono triggers lunarfestival music theres no denying its just too similar one another
