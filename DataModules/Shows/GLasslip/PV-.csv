seems very interesting. must..watch...
hahah I'm really wanting to and looking forward to watching this not just because PA Works, but cause Taneda Risa is there..and I love these slice of life anime shows
The music in the video really reminded me of Hanasaku Iroha. Can't wait to watch this.
It got chickens plus PA works.......... #InstaWatch
@lunawarwolf87 that would be because nano.RIPE does several songs in Hanasaku Iroha (seriously love them all, one of my favorite animes).
@lunawarwolf87 Yeah, Nano.RIPE has a unique sound that I have liked since Hanasaku Iroha. Good to hear it again.
I need subtitles *cry*
Word(s).
lmao at all comments above. so so true

Very true. You know you've watched too much anime when you don't need subtitles to know what's going on.
I watch a ton and yet i am unable to translate welp
the animation is sooooooo pretty, this is already in my watchlist
Reminds me of Anohana for some reason. Like it, definitely watching this.
A P.A. Works series? This is a must watch! I hope it has great character development like that of Nagi No Asukara!
it looks like it's going to make me cry.. :(
and sounds like it too
Looks like a grown up version of Anohana, can't wait to watch it!
The scenery itself kinda reminds me of Nagi no asakura. This looks so interesting. I hope there won't be any ninjas cutting onions on this one. I don't think my heart would be prepared for that.
I thought the exact same thing, was just scrolling through the comments wondering if anyone else saw the resemblance... Same production team maybe? Def on my watch list
Why is Haru in this anime? He's suppose to be training for Nationals or Regionals or whatever.
So this is an anime about chickens?
Chickens appear to be involved....but they may not be central to the story. Subtitles would help a lot.
A slice of life work about a group of friends, each with varying circumstances and goals. Central theme based on the PV appears to be the contrast between living in the present and working towards a vision of the future.
Rest assured this is no Tamako market. The chickens do not talk and KyoAni is not involved.
I dunno... I remember the LAST time P.A. Works had a chicken in an anime... True Tears, anyone?
true tears...:'( i dont know wheather to smile or cry...
a nice slow and steady slice of life its always good, to many action anime this days, when all one wants to do is relax with a nice story after coming out of work. This will be a good anime
Shouldn't be hard to put subtitles in the PV I would think. Would help me know whats going on
Looks like a lot of drama, not sure if I'm emotionally ready for this :/
I don't get why Cr doesn't sub the pv's
I already know which character I'mma end up falling for....
00:59 Tsumugu(Nagi no Asukara) is that you?!?! o u o;
Seems like a good anime to watch this summer! It feels very summer-y, you know.
reminds me of nagi no asukara...ADD TO QUEUE!
Probably because its made by the same studio
Same studio as nagi no asu, hanasaku iroha, and tari tari... in short you know this will be a great slice of life work. Also a theme (ED) by nano.Ripe, so I have high expectations.
PA WORKS did Angel Beats
Yes .... lets keep posting obvious comments to others viewers that are lazy enough to not look up the studio which shows all their different previous works XD
YAYY. Lol. I am one of those lazy viewers hahaha
I have no idea what they are saying but I feel the feels already
