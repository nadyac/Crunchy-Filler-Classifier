only 2 mins into the ep and let me just say..fuck you Danzo
hes like the ghost nappa of naruto xD

@Lionhead23b: Nah. He'd just go kill folks who oppose him. He'd of killed Minato anyway, then blame it on the Stone & cause a new war with them. Then he'd blame that on The Third. Hey! If you like Danzo, then you'll love Emperor Palpatine!
g
Danzo makes Palpatine look like a saint. At least he admits what he is in the end.
Someone give Guy a hug. He is trying really hard >.<
Well he did had to kill one of his best friends, I wouldnt blame him
I don't think he is blaming anyone. I mean Danzo is a snake tongued bastard who could turn a saint into a sinner. He is taking advantage of the weakness in Kakashi's heart.
Danzo twisted the truth of what the 3rd was doing.
Poor Kakashi. He's just a kid & he's got P.T.S.D. from killing his friend while on the battle field. A friendly fire incident is haunting his dreams. What kind of childhood is that? Who really wants that? I'm sure Gai will save his friend.
*hugs* I agree hehe and man did he love dumplings at that age! Guy seems to be the only one really trying to pull Kakashi out of it.
Even the Feudal Lord doesn't like Danzo. Confirmed everyone hates Danzo...
Danzo sees the world through war colored glasses, with him at the top of the chain directing. Power is his aim. Hardly a "good" guy. His motives just happen to align with the betterment of the Leaf.
And Hanzo zzzz
@bhbuehler uh yes we do? its pretty much proven hes admitted it, go back to the hideouts and the fight clubs he put together, the experiments with the revival jutsu's, and curse marks? MMM ._.
@edosansung: At first I was like, 'You're nuts!' But after some thought, I remembered Sarutobi Hiruzen's words to Danzo, "We need both the light and the dark. If we lose either one, then there would be disruptions." So, now I see your point
Maybe Hanzo really was just truely selfish until this day when he decides the fucked up things he will do actually will have to benefit the leaf for him to do them
OKAY!! Lesson learned. Never sneak up on Kakashi. NEVER.

Agreed about the bandwidth. For the most part it is that there are far too many people trying to watch the episode first thing in HD. That is the problem. Crunchyrolls servers are ok, but they are not meant to be bombarded by 50,000 ppl
Hmmm, So if everyone tries to watch a show at 1080 at launch there could be lag??? why is that? Thats like saying if everyone tries to make a phone call at the same time there could be lag/congestion ?? oh wait is really is like that....
Theres a place you can go to complain about this. This is not that place. Theres also alot of factors (some user, others provider) that can be and likely is the majority of the reasons for poor performance.
If I get lag a lot I usually try stepping down to the next lower quality and that usually helps even though I get 25 Mbps down from my ISP.
'Scuse me, is this the line for ObamaCare?
Aww Young Yamato looks adorable~
Awesome episode! Anyone notice while Kakashi is reading about Hashirama and the Wood Style, one of the dead shinobi looks exactly like Sasuke? xD
I did, I also noticed that the Third Hokage has the same voice of King Bradley in FMA, (Hidekatsu Shibata). That took me long enough, I guess the Third hasn't been around much lately.
Haha, yeah I saw the Sasuke lookalike as well.
I thought I saw Madara, the real one.
Wooo! More ANBU Kakashi and ANBU Yamato action~ Mokuton!
"A segment of anime, whether it be an entire episode or part of one, which does not appear in the manga of the title." - urbandictionary dot com. This filler seems more relevant to story and enjoyable, but not in manga = filler.
I'd advise against quoting a definition like that. You'll forget how the definition of "filler" works, especially since manga can have "filler" too. Observe the word directly, it is there to fill up time so that a work lasts longer.
This is doing well to get people interested in the kakashi spinoff.... I was sold before these episodes aired but now I'm hyped for it.
in a shonen anime "filler" means non-canon. So this is filler, good filler mind you, but filler none the less.
i love fillers for anime it makes the series go on longer meaning less sad times for us
To make matter Worse for Danzo, (what i got from this episode) Danzo tried talking kakashi into killing Lord Third, wtf danzo.....

Thus ends another Thursday morning, with an episode of Naruto Shippuden.
I Love this arc! I don't care if it is a filler at least we learn more about the characters back story. People that complain about fillers should be grateful that the anime hasn't ended and when it does everyone will want more episodes.

I only complain about some fillers. Like the one when they were rebuilding the village and everyone got a pointless flashback. Who are the trying to fool, everyone knows they were just trying to waste time.
I would hardly call this filler. I read the manga, and because of bad memory lol, I don't remember if this was in there, but it's definitely part of the story, and something I was really curious about.
It definitely wasn't in the manga, and therefore it's filler. It's really good filler, but it's still filler.
When the anime has finished I'll be hoping they go back and redo the series without all the filler and dragging out they've done. If they did that then I would buy the dvds because I could actually enjoy rewatching all of the episodes.
That Macbeth reference, all of neptune's water will not rid him of his guilt
Yay, finally some more extensive background information on Kakashi. Kakashi time! <3 Though, I really am excited about them getting back to the present arc as it is very interesting.
I liked the ineraction between Hiruzen and Danzo. They have a very interesting dynamic.
As much as like I like this Kakashi arc. I can't wait till it's over and we get to see some Madara and Obito action.
Confirmed! Naruto Space-uden!
Implying there's any action upcoming... This series had so much potential wasted to carter kids (and yet I still watch it)
as far as what's coming up, action is an understatement
According to them the entirety of this war will be the end for them with the writing.
i know right!! i rlly wish i could see some of the major fight now lol

i think its yamato,jiraya,kabuto,white zetsu,
No its Uchiha Izuna
Danzo is a sneaky bastard...But I love the way the third hokage put him in check.

That's one of the reasons why he is the third hokage!

Getting caught spinning in the Hokage chair. AWKWARD!
it bring back memoirs when i was on elementary
WV5LK7WMFPW B3U6ZVHY3VU WNPK87NB4UP VCFVJCLGEKW somebody takes advantage of those; I never get to use them.
Thanks!
is it just me but im starting to feel sorry for obito he only wanted to save rin and could till it was to late and Madara Knew to stall him for just long enough.
