Dude....holy sh*t...Arcadios gets major badass points this episode.
Tater, learn the rate of heat transfer. touching a flame would bring your skin temperature up, much faster than your blood. you would be down to charred muscle before your blood would reach boiling temperature, plus its flowing.
Why argue over minor details. Suffice to say lava is deadly. Even being near it. I've always rolled my eyes when video games put you mere feet away from it in a room full of it. The ambient temp alone..Anyhow you survive by magic/plot armor
Anyone else remember the previous episodes? They explained how people can take the kind of damage they dish out in this series with just minor scraps or bruises to show for it. MAGIC, they use it to strengthen their bodies defense too.

Arcadios = floor is lava master.
This episode reminded me of my childhood "watch out there's lava on the floor!"
I died so many times as a child because of those lava floors. Well that and my "friend" who always pushed me into said lava.

They did mark them as spoilers and it was featured in the episode. I don't really see what you are complaining about.

the new OP is really catchy lol
For a moment i thought there was a new op after 6 eps but gotta give it up for boa who sang this op xD
Amazing song, the video is questionable.
Na-nanana-nanana Oh! Na-nanana-na Hey! Hey!
This OP has me hypnotized & wrapped around its finger! (/>3<)/ MASAYUME CHASING! Na-nanana-nanana Oh! Na-nanana-na Hey! Hey!
I love the Natsu and Lucy scene at the end
come on mirajane kick her ass already.............
She shouldn't struggle anymore now that Lisana is back
@gonzalez007 when in the series did mira get demoted from s-class as far as I remember she never lost that rank
@marinewrestler i'm pretty sure they've referred to her as a former s-class a few times, although i don't think she lost the rank formally.
well she should tactically still an S-class, otherwise she wouldn't been on the Tenj Island with Erza and Gildarts on the S-class exam.
she had stopped fighting once Lisanna died so she was former S class then she began fighting again as an S-class
LOL, what the hell is Happy imagining...
He is always imagining something hella crazy lol


Just wait 'til you see him in action!
Ya that form of Gajeel is pretty badass
I prefer the first part art of Gajeel, he looks how he should look like, a punk dragonslayer. I also don't like the new art of Gilg- I mean Laxus. He looks kinda like a frog now. And in the end, both of it is due to them taking out details.

Little kids: ruining self esteem everywhere forever

It's already pretty far ahead in the manga.. So I wouldn't mind this going a bit faster haha ;;;
Agreed they are really dragging this fight out for some reason
LOL right this fight was legit like. Barely a chapter, they got their asses whooped this is sooo drawn out. The manga is way ahead so.. I don't think that's it

Considering the first iteration was cancelled due to catching up to the manga, I think I'd rather have them take it a little slow; its rare enough for a long-running series to come back once it's off the air, I doubt they'd get a third try.

Contradictions. I specifically remember Jose (Phantom Lord's master) stating that Fairy Tail only rose to power once Makarov became master. But it seems the First's was just as rowdy.
I think by that they mean publicly. As in FT had power before, and built a strong foundation. Than Erza, Natsu and the others came along and really put the guilds name out there. Even if not for the best reasons.
You know that you are & have a super badass guild if you have been that way since Number one was the Master xD
Well we got some filler in this episode or anime add ons, but that is okay, I thought the Asuka sense was funny and adorable.
Gotta always count on the kids to call it how they see it XD What's even more funnier though is the fact that in Maven's time she had rooms piled high with just Apology Letters.Well, if you want to count on a guild to mix up trouble,call FT
the problem is we need to wait til next week
Dried plums, only used in the most heinous of murders.
Those things just had to resemble Wendy's weakness. Looks like she's gotten her herself into a pickle... or in this case, a dried plum xP
you need to come up withered plums. They'll bleach much better.
Best part about Fridays

yes and no she a leas has to have her key for them to come out on there own. So Lucy is just a girl now lol.
She could unleash that Urano-something spell she did in the Oracion Seis arc and almost did in her fight with Flare.
Urano Metria, and if you'll recall she needs Gemini to pull that off. though I suppose Yukino might be able to do it in Gemini's stead....
Hmm helpless lucy again....looks like its time for Loke to show up again since he don't need no stinkin key to be summoned XD
Aye sir!
I guess you could say Arcadios is taking his hot meal to go.
Dried plums, Wendy's one weakness. Looks like she's got herself into a sour situation.
So instead of having motion sickness as her weakness its sour stuff
Well, one would say it's better to be bullied by sour stuff than to be unable to quickly travel to many different places.
When did people suddenly stop calling them prunes? I see 'dried plums' everywhere now, I don't see 'dried grapes' instead of raisins though.
Because umeboshi are closer to apricots than plums.
Recap ends at 3:20 roughly
Arcadios just went terminator on us
Still waiting to see Natsu use that god slayer flame.
I want to see he him use the electric-fire flame and god flame at the same time
dchompy that would be epic...and extremely OP haha
