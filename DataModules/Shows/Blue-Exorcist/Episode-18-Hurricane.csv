could konekomaru be a any more of a puss
@applecupsup i love your picture it's so cuuuttee
I like how his cat doesnt help him
probably taking a cat nap
Did you ever have one of those days when an evil crow possesses you? Koneko's having one of those days...:P
Rin is so nice, how do they not trust him?
I would trust him even more because hes the son of satan, it probably gives him more motivation to kick the shit out of his dead beat dad XD
Rin ----> Son of Satan Konekomaru -----> Krillin in another anime?
I understand why they don't trust Rin. If they did right away they would be stupid. I do think they don't have to be asses about it though.
Did you not see the scene where he tried to kill that demon next to koneko without giving them an explanation... hes an idiot and doesnt explain why things look the way they do thats why they dont trust him
Not just the Main cast of the Anime, but ALL characters who are on Screen, 110% of the time, have issues too. And when not monologuing each other, its like they forget what is said during panic or in times of Confidence within One another.
I want Rin's teeth.....biting people would be so fun =D
Let's be honest guys. If you found out one of your friends was the son of Satan, you'd probably get the hell out of there and run to the nearest church.
I accidentally brused my brothers back purple with a basseball and a few times I was asked if I was a vampire because of my teeth.
I used to have teeth like that, but the alignment of my jaw caused them to wear down dangerously fast. My teeth are all even now, which I have been told is actually creepier...But I miss them :'(
No, Twinchap...I'd certainly seek Mental care, albeit. Cause not only am I acknowledging gobbleydegook which is as real as Elmo, but Heck...If I'd go back to where I went last time...That place was LOVELY Stay for a Lock-Down 72 Hr ward! XD
My eyeteeth/canines are so prominent I have a bulge in my gums, lower and upper jaw.
Man if I had fangs tearing through a steak would be a breeze
Welll, You know You CAN get the procedure done Cosmetically...! Just a thought!
How can you NOT be friends with, Rin? <3333333 Rinny ;u;
There's a whole bunch of shit going on, but my mind keeps drawing back to last episode when Yukio was in his underwear... >//////////<
His butt though ... ufffffnnff, perfection!
I hate that little monk kid. He shouldn't let himself get haunted by that retarded bird. >:(
I agree. I didnt see this coming, honestly in either the Anime or Manga which I'm Reading and have been the last several Weeks. I liked Him! Knew He was quiet, but definitely didn't expect Him to channel His own "mini Path of Pain" vs Rin!
riinnn y r u so freakin hot!omg
When is Rin gonna stop being stubborn and actually train.
I want to watch more....but it's 4:32 am....I work in three hours. Probably an hour of sleep would help...but.....well, at least it's not at a cliffhanger again.
it's 8:41am =_=
This episode pissed me off so much >:O they all made him feel like crap and they didn't even say sorry only konekomaru and then at the end they act like nothing happened? seriously -.- a big f you! to bon I hate him now -__-
Agreed. Fuck everybody at the end of this episode. Rin earned that sweet, sweet vindication and they were just assholes. Give Konekomaru at least a little grief.
The biggest shithead in this anime to me is Konekomaru. I know Rin is the son of satan and all, but damn they don't have to be assholes about it! >:l
Well, THAT may be going a bit far...I believe that Konekamaru was, One way or another being led by this Beast to do as He did. Notice at 6:30 into the Video what the Beast says...Kona totes wasn't completely under His own FULL sentience.
Poor Rin :'(
such a weak willed person
lmao! his name is uke! rate this up if ya know wat i mean. lol anyway
Aww...how cute a lil hamster amaimon. xD
Thumbs up if you hate Konekomaru!
Konekomaru's annoying me..he was the only one who rly objected fixin' the Koma Sword too.. @nov1336 Blame the killer, not the offspring. Thats stupid Why drag in ppl who hav nothing to do with it? no point.~ You couldn't possibly gain it
I love Rin!! <3 He is soooo adorable!!! I never want this anime to end.
