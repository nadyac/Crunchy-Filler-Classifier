The voice actor of Yutaro is the same person as that of Luffy from One Piece
This show reminds me so much of Gintama..only classic...
I was thinking the same thing.
The main difference with Gintama is that, in place of "Westerners" invading Japan's culture, it was aliens. I think they're actually both set in the Meiji Period, that being said. Or that was always my theory.

Isn't that hard on the chandelier?
This is why Kenshin is so amazing. He fights for a just government where he knows will punish him for his crimes if it becomes a reality. A true hero.
