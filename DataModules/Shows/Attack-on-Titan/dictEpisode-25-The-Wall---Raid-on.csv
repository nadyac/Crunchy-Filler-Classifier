around 15 minute mark almost quite literally wall text this comment removed hehe turn what am gonna do life now 2016 so story begins this comment removed ugh ended such cliff hangar now sequel will made years after original apparently make sure watch very very end after credits dont know why but every time see rieneers facei cant help remembering armored titan not read manga so am just speculating last scene really want us nightmares cant sleep right now thanks bruh sooooooothat thing endermmmafter creditsthat titanwall breathed laughteror nawh but still creepy ending keep us guessing teenage mutant ninjatitan everyone throw money random attack titan merchandise so enough money make season just good fuck feeding your kids more important loooool truer words never spoken season already gotten release date more precisely yeardate its told released 2016 thats good idea especially sense japanese economy just tanked annie use harden its super effective oh god used haki why didnt ever think about till read your comment xd way us fans some start kickstarter next season sometimes feel though merch will not directly support feel theres option directly support creators chances high could always use stock market well kind could support animation company but not show specifically whereas buy merch than shows interest particular show well gives everyone involved more money suppose could always become sponsor send money instruction use one aot season but who knows would probably already making material available will ready release soon get enough second season isnt funny everytime eren annie fought end up some type sex position fact thought way means your pervert most thous positions were wrestling moves lol knew someone would thinking xd what wrestling moves ones involve bed every position sex position because naturally before having sex humans wrestle its so male can show can dominance over female female wins then dont mate best anime year most enjoyment ive gotten out series long time thanks director author everyone worked amazing anime all emotions spurred but now feel empty reaching end lol hope another onethere so much still dont know heard wont second season but last episode will come out december will go extent being select cinemas according various magazines but dont like its fruits basket all over again reason why im sure second season will great because taking time hope keep short about 50+ episodes like full metal alchemist death note then againdeath note didnt best ending im guessing will make 2nd season once manga gets far enough finishes already said will make 2nd season but not year 2014 since working movie manga comes out monthly starting production next year damn gotta love symbolism mikasa giving eren bread first
