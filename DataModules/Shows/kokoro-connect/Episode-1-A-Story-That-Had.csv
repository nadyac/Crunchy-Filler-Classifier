Let's face it, for any guy who suddenly finds himself in a girl's body, the first thing he's gonna do is play with the boobs.
If I turned into a male, I would play with my dick. hahaha
you'd like it, it's great
It would be awkward to be pleasuring yourself with parts you didn't have previously, but yes, boobs would be the first priority, of course.
I'd probably be confused for a few minutes and then realize awkwardly that I needed to use the restroom.
First and foremost. I'd learn how to pee as a girl. just cuz its a total mystery to me
Is that an Undertaker poster on their club room wall? Har har

I never thought I'd see Undertaker from WWE again.
@imtheonlysane1here Talk about Yamada and the 7 witches!
Thumbs up if you're a member of the "Go Home" club
love that anime!!!
same here!
Me here after watching all of school days: "Why is everyone so happy???"
Watching this after School Days makes me expect it to turn really dark in a couple of episodes...
@Etgamerz gotta love your dp xD

@Edua, maybe.....
@Panda-chan, uh so first, we take the titan out, then we let the steam out e_e
You gotta hold it ever so slightly to the right though because it likes to hang to the left a bit and if left to it's own devices will miss completely. .........or is that just me.
each one is different some lean to the right, others to the left
As a girl, I'd hope the switch happened in winter so I could go outside and write my name in the snow. XD
First thing the male did after realizing he was in a girl's body was touch her/his breasts. Sounds about right.
the male
undertaker!!!!
everytime i saw that rainbow i was hopeing to see the nyan cat going by
Almost every anime starts off with a lazy but talented brother that gets waken up by a annoying kid sister who has excellent cooking skills and has breakfast ready so her brother won't be late for school. So cliche...
HEY it happens...... somewhere....
i think that might be me.... im scared
My little sister would wake me up by letting the dog into my room so he would jump on me and lick my face until I got up >.>
Is this what going to happen every episode.
Hope so.
I know why this is happening! ....Aliens.
nope a wizard did it! haha
Not even 5 minutes a bit of perving at schoolgirls [and paying 120 yen for the privilege[. You stay classy Japan.
Guy says no to having sex with a lesbian while possessing a female body, I've come to the conclusion that he's homosexual.
Uh don't forget you'll get the feeling of being violated
I am fine with this.
yeah that scene was getting hot. its a shame the real iori had to but in.
He admitted it was about to get busy -- he was merely interrupted!
The orange haired chick looks like Asuna from SAO and The other chicks sounds just like kurapika from hunter x hunter ^_^
nice to see a fellow sao watcher watching this
the guy looks like kirito too!! lol
just finished with Chihayafuru and his name is Taichi. The feels!
Plenty of shows have a body swap episode, but I haven't seen it used for a whole series before. It'll be interesting to see where they go with it. Also, it's unusual to see an anime character with a facial blemish. It's really distracting!
I KNOW!!! First thing I did when I saw it was pause the video and wipe my computer screen.... But it was still there!!!!
First time I ever saw a facial blemish was in Nyarko-san
my first time was yukio in blue excorcist
hooray!!!! now i have some thing interesting to watch ^^
The $64million question:- can they keep this interesting for more than a couple of episodes??
I feel like I'm very late to this show, this upsets me
Was that supposed to be a poster of the Undertaker in their club room?
OMG it's Naze from medaka box!
