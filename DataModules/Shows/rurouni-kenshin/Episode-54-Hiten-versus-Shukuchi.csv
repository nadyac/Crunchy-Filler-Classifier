The bad-assery here is off the charts
I'm digging the cool, jazzy ending song!


Ok so Epic doesn't define how Epic this episode is.. If that makes sense......... BUT...... Sojiro really pissed me off until this episode.. :O O_o
Who would win in a fight, Kenshin or Kenshiro? I'm Betting Kenshiro. WAAA CHA CHA CHA CHA!
Kenshiro has superhuman strength, beyond that which is found in this anime, so I agree with you. But, it's an apples to oranges comparison. A fairer battle would be Kenshiro vs. Goku, perhaps.
It's also comparing across decades. Kenshin is of the Meiji Era; Kenshiro appears in the year of 199X after nuclear war engulfs the world.
Well, seeing as his skin becomes 10x tougher than steel when shirtless, his Hokuto Shinken similar to Futae no Kiwami with Shukuchi speed, and an unwavering will to fight to the death I would say Kenshiro would win hands-down.
RK is an anime based off real events that actually took place. Kenshin's character was based off a real samurai named Kawakami Gensai who lived at the same time as the anime takes place. FOTNS and DB(Z,GT) are mostly fantasy.
