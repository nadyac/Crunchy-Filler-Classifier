Ah, it's nice seeing Conan pop up in Kid's show.

If you want to watch this episode in Conan's POV, it is Detective Conan episode 627-628
thnx
Is it just me or they skip ep 5 - 10 ?!
Yeah I'm a bit confused as well...... maybe I just forgot how to count?
They well be putting out 2 older eps plus 1 new ep each week till they are all caught up. It was in the news annoucement
ah.
guess i can't watch 11-12 till they find 5-10...
Even if they need to spread out the releases, it's still stupid to release a part 2 episode without part 1...
Inspector: "He used fire to activate the sprinklers!" Great detective skills man.
I like how Nakamori-keibu is just like "hey Conan, let me consult with you about KID" and last time when it was Shinichi, he was like "NO GET AWAY. THIS IS MY TURF."
had no idea starting this series it was so connected to that series i watched briefly on tv when it was dubbed. (they stopped showing new episodes and was not to where i could search for it and watch elsewhere)
Great Episode!

This is just a cameo with Conan, not actually trying to follow the DC storyline. That's why its out of order. This storyline is supposed to be separate from DC I believe
haha gd one < 3 glad to see conan
just realized they skipped like 6 eps. fuu
Volume 70, chapters 731 - 733 in the DC manga. =3
well crap i didn't even realize this was ep. 11 until after i watched it...O_O
such a flawless plan! what could go wrong?
I just spit my pop out. FREAKING CONAN?!!? NANNNNII
you can find episodes 9 and 10 on Gogoanime.com
His hair. It's black. . . but it was brown before. Did he die it?
