What happened to the horse? Best character of this arc.
no one in this damn show ever has to pay for their evil doing no matter how many people they kill or how many villages they destroy. It's ridiculous.
One of the main themes of the show is atoning for your own sins. So, it's left up to the characters to find a way to atone. Things don't work that way in the real world, because most real villains don't choose to atone.
There's a Buddhist belief that says "Purity and impurity depend on oneself. No one purifies another." This can be taken to mean that nobody can punish another person for their evil deeds. That makes the aforementioned a bit clearer.
I wish i had been able to watch this as a kid- my childhood would have been so much more epic haha!
It was great
