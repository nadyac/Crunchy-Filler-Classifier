what clothes :3

I loved the first chunin exam arc.. but i have to be honest i like this one as well. + I'd like to see more of fuu
Nothing beats the filler with Naruto and the Ostrich, that was my favorite filler ep.
Is there no official canon for the second chunin exams?
I think this actually is canon, but I don't really feel like sorting through the manga to prove it.
This filler story IS canon to the show. It was said early on (somewhere in the first 10 episodes) that Naruto and Sasuke were the only ones that wasn't chunin. It was in that same episode that we learned that Gaara was the new kazekage.

Am actually ok with this filler its just as interesting as the first Chunin Exams
I thought the first chunin exams were a lot more interesting
God. This ep just reminded me that Naruto is still a goddamned genin. >.<'
Isn't he a Sanin currently? O.o
Sannin isnt a ranking of ninja. It translates to "three people" Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru where sannin because the helped in the Ninja War and Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura are probably considered Sannin because they are heroes now.
Naruto is a Sennin, as in Sage. It is not a rank, it is a title. His current rank is still that of a Genin here.
That feel when this filler is going to last for at least 3 more months probably. It's a whole fucking Chunin exam. ;_;
It'll probably take 5-6 months if they're doing 20+ filler episodes. This is the last filler arc after all so they aren't holding back.
@The Lion Souled oh f*ck yes there is Haruhi Suzumiya.
Oh my God, the endless seven days. That was such a troll, I watched that online and I still got trolled, having to feed through each episode with it's pathetically tiny differences hoping I don't miss something important!
pls no :c

If everyone just didnt answer a question, theyd all pass and no one would have a lowest average.
exactly; need to remember the chunin exams only award the best for final promotion and with that if you can narrow your field of competitors even getting rid of others who may be better trained then you by a mere simple flaw you do it

Then you'd go below the average and fail. With your idea would just get not to be immediately disqualified, but you'll fail because you're below the average.

jeez it's prisoner's dilemma. think about it a little. A 90 is likely to get a team disqualified since many teams are likely to get 100.
I've got nothing against these fillers, they are quite interesting. Even though I want the main story, it's not like this is disappointing.
same here,but i just want to see Madara which is becoming way more badass now ;-;
Except Robo Naruto. That one was just trolling us for a week! xD
maybe this is the part where neji solves the exam and gets promoted to jounin. I may be wrong but among the konoha 11 he is the only jounin. I'll count this filler as canon-filler
i was excited to watch this episode until i remembered it would just be another filler, it's not a bad story and i don't want naruto to end but i really wanna see the end already give us fillers after the last episode
Man its good to see Neji again ;_;
Glad I wasn't the only one who thought that.
Keep the fillers coming , I don't want Naruto to end !!!
same here!!
Like always when things are starting to get interesting and we get all hyped up for the next episode they totally take dump on us and kill our emotional hype just like that by giving us a filler. It's always the same pattern in Naruto.
its not ending forever lol they are making another series of naruto after shippuden
In manga form, that is.
Don't worry with how popular Naruto they're obviously going make a anime adaption eventually.
all of these fillers the madara episode better be a movie
why so much filers when the manga is over ?

Glad to know I wasn't the only one
You weren't. I've always wanted to see Fuu and Han. They seem like interesting characters and they have next to no real information on them. So hope to see more of her in this filler arc
Isn't the obvious answer the fact that there were 2 classrooms upstairs and 1 downstairs to designate the 50+50+0 questions?
Isn't it "just" as obvious that the 40 point question is the bottom and the two 30s are the tops? No, really: I can see assuming the ground floor is zero, but it is an assumption. If we needed 0+1+1, then it seems symbolic.
*Facepalm* Don't know how I didn't notice that the other option is also 2 of one and 1 of the other when I thought that.
Even though this is a filler, i have to say I love watchin this Chunin exam stuff. Its as good as the first time they did this,
I agree. I loved the original Chunin exam arc and so far this Chunin exam is shaping up to be just as good.
If you hate fillers, for you should probably be reading the dang manga ffs... Anime do this. Beside I love this universe and learning more about the events that happened. I love relevant 'filler'. I am in no rush to leave Naruto Universe.
Shikamaru, you magnificent bastard I read your book!

Yup, that first test would definitely be a guaranteed pass if Naruto was on the team.
