My mood has never gone from uplifted, happy, and proud right to bone-chilling, "OH SHIT!" so fast.
So freaking good, my favorite anime this season did not disappoint.

Doesn't matter how thick skinned you are, that arrow went right thru his heart!
I originally read the OP's post and was like "Wha..?" then I finished the episode and was like "OMG! They're right! Holy crap!" Next episode! I almost don't even wanna see what happens after this meeting. Ahhhh!!!
In this episode, when Sinha says he's hungry, he uses the feminine phrase "anaka suita" instead of the masculine phrase "hara hetta." Very interesting....
This episode just took this show to a completely new level. Everything about this episode was perfect.

The character development alone was amazing. Watch the first two episodes again and then this one.
YES DART! YES!
Episode ends.... *throws laptop out window*.
@mariokarter13 he is there because there have been a lot of problems in Awa, he went there just like them to see the problem. It isn't that unlikely for her to run into him.
I might as well take this time to clarify: I have no problem with the twist in and of itself, but with the execution. It's like she ran headlong into a tree. In the desert.
Does Yona has true bloodlust now that she has killed? Soo-Won is not so safe around her, me thinks.
personally, i think soo-won is going to torture her though, not the other way around.... but i mean i see her this close (fingers just barely not touching) to freezing up.

THE ACTION, THE TENSION, THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, THE EXCITEMENT, THAT UNEXPECTED ENDING HOLY SH!T ALL OF THE BUILD UP AND SLOW PACING. THEY MADE IT UP IN THIS ONE EPISODE. TOTALLY MAKING THIS ANIME ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS SEASON!!
People, PLEASE stop perpetuating this scanlation-reading. I beg you!! Publishers don't license series they know the majority of potential readers have already read, and will have little motivation to purchase. If you can't wait, import it.
Personally, I buy the DVDs, books, etc. Because I've fallen in like with the scan/translations that I've found online OR been able to watch on Crunchyroll. It can take years for English translations to catch up to the original.
I'm happy for fans who buy, but so many DON'T buy after reading scans online. Having 12+ vol scanned online makes US publishers not want to license it, because the content's already out there, basically impossible to take down.
My point is, scanlators are NOT HELPING a series' chances of being licensed when they continue beyond the first volume or two. You might argue 1-2 vol help introduce new readers and let them "preview" but anything past that is only harmful.
my heart d r o p p e d at the end, both upset and happy and scared and lovestruck AHH.
She is truly Yona of the dawn. This episode gave me chills.
Well you say "broken" if you use "dawn" but it might be more like "Yona has risen" - IDK, I'm no linguist but that would account for both possibilities.
Indeed. "Yona" only means a few obscure, rarely used words in Japanese, none of which mean dawn. (It's also the way you would pronounce "Jonah" in Japanese, but I don't think anyone cares about that.)
Yona is, in keeping with the show's naming scheme, a Korean girl's name. It means "lotus blossom", hence a lot of the show's imagery
Its a freaking name. It doesnt have to mean anything.
God I love Yona. Just goes to show you, you don't have to be OP to be a good main character.
Although it helps to have an OP harem to make up for it.
Let's all be honest here..Kumji deserved to get every single squire inch of his ass kicked. That arrow had his name written on it.
Kumji got Slained.
Did anyone even look for Kumji's body to make sure he died? And where was Hak at the end? I know he was rock-hard when he saw Yona make that shot. He should be stalking...err...guarding her!
It didn't appear that he actually got hit in the heart, although it was darn close. You just know he will make another appearance.
Spoiler
Kumji be sleeping with da fishes. The boats had set sail & were out to sea. Who'd let him get saved & taken back to shore? I enjoyed thinking about the off screen moment where Jae Ha pushes him under the water just to be sure.

Yea, it definitely was an "Oh shit!" moment.


That ending tho! bricks were shat
Man, I'm gonna be so sad if they don't give us a season 2. You really can't do this series justice in a single season.

I don't think things can be summed up in just a movie or OVA, or even with just one other season (the manga is still ongoing and a LOT has happened and will still happen). I wish they make more seasons...
Talking about second seasons...I want Claymore Season 2 Why must I be reminded of the fact theres only one anime season for that? I love that show.
Claymore was amazing
to bad its not on crunchyroll
This episode was amazing! Action and humor and Squirrel, oh my! It's definitely satisfying to see just how strong Yona has become.
"You can take my arms or head, or anything else you want, but don't touch Yona--" So many notable scenes in this episode. Let's not forget that Yun and Yona moment.
I never forget the Yoon and Yona moments. They're so fluffy and adorable.
.....that ending...that squirrel....that stripping.....
that stripping makes you go from "oh yea" to "wtf, lol" really fast.
"Don't eat Sinha, squirrel!" Chewing through the ropes earlier now seems entirely coincidental...
He was eating a bowl later on too. A solid stone bowl. Took whole chunks off it! That squirrel will devour them all one day, bones and everything.

the last color he saw was orange --- that of the dawn as he fell into the sea.
What better way to fire up Yona's loyal servants by saying you can hit on her after the battle.
I hope a certain someone gets Hak'd to pieces next episode.

spoiler dude
Nice spoiler asshat
And everyone watching collectively said "FFUUUUUUCCKKKK!!!"
All together now!
EH?!?!?!?! THAT ENDING?! WHY YOU MAKE US WAIT A WEEK?! NO, WE NEED TO KNOW NOW!!! GAHHH!!!! The battle scenes were so cool. I love all the characters. They are all so amazing!
The battle scenes were truly incredible. I feel truly ashamed that I complained about the animation at the beginning of the arc for even a second. If there was an ever an episode that money should saved up for, it was this episode.
I used to be an insufferable slave trading douche bag, but then I took an arrow to the knee......
Hitting on Yona. Hak: That might be good... and Now I'm all fired up! YAY!!!
