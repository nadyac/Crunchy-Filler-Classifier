completely agree. He's such a wussy when he needs to be confident, and overly bold when he should hold back.
He's probably overly bold at times like that because he's trying to compensate for his wussiness. Just charging in headfirst eliminates the chance for him to chicken out.
There sure is a lot of moth-slaying in this arc.
