I think its more likley, that Kirito figured out DG's ploy, and hesitated enough to see what's going on.
@Backflip_2003 @Warchefray It was explained in the anime as well (Yui's ALO capabilities). Anyway, due to her core programming she does understand how to use admin powers, but she'd still need credentials. Otherwise she'd just be denied.
Kiri-OP does it again
lol...

Ikr?! I was thinking LOOK ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?! >:(
all of them in ALO would be like "not another one, damn you Kirito"
Don't worry, there's someone to nurse him back in the hospital
^ lmao that nurse though
looooooooo
Guy gets shot through the stomach by a sniper rifle, his body is blown apart and his legs fall into a chasm. "DEAD" Thanks for the notification, GGO...
hilarious lol
I like how the marker is on his legs and not his head.
I think he was being sarcastic as in the guy got blown apart but the game still gives you a notification that he died,when you all ready now that
LMAO! XD
Maybe the marker is there for the other player. "Oh, he's dead, and not playing dead." Like that.
"It's a gun game, but he'll still use a sword instead of a gun." Ofc.
The fast, fluid movements are a result of 100% of the weight being in the handle, him being used to heavier swords isn't really a factor, it's just that the photon sword is really light. Making the obvious comparison with the lightsaber.
Nevermind that it SOUNDS like one.
Ikr, it's like they sampled the sound effects from Star Wars and just put them in.
^ Not that theres a problem with that. I mean even the gundam series for the longest time have used a sample of a lightsaber's general hum as part of their overall sound.
photo = a light particle, saber = a type of sword

@querkle. If you know the light novels like I do and I think I know what you are thinking, I really hope that horrible cliffhanger doesn't happen. To wait a year or more for that.... uggggg
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's possible that Kirito shot Sinon. Think about it, if you're a distance away and DG is about to kill her what do you do? Shoot her first to remove her from the tournament so he can't kill her.
I think some one else shot the gun from Death Gun's hand. maybe one of sinons friends
Who else had to go back and make sure the sound Death Gun's shot makes during the first kill and the sound-effect in the blackout in the end were the same? :3
@kcaz64 It was my impression DG didn't kill Dyne because he was already dead. Maybe the gun has no effect on a dead avatar or DG figured D had logged out or something.


Sinon is a planned kill, Remember episode 3? the list with Zekushiido & another picture had a red X' over them while Sinon's picture didn't. The folder was titled "photolist" That was a hit list if i ever saw one.

But wait can you really say that DG did not plan to kill her if you go back a few eps Sinon was on DG`s list
True, she was a planned kill, he had his eyes on her already thro the computer that other episode. NO SINON DOONT DIE!!!

Needs more "Same Sword Time, Same Sword Channel."
The cliffhanger is real. 2 days to see how it turns out.
I might have to re-subscribe just so I can see this sooner.
@microalgae, or ya know just use another anime site

Like a good wife, Asuna acts as soon as she knows something's wrong.
It would've been pretty shoddy if they all just sat there, "No big out, Kirito's hunting serial killers again". Glad they didn't drop the ball there, although Kirito really should've said "killed two, no wait, three people now" to Sinon.
Asuna is the best girl in the world. *_*
No panicking from here. She springs into action and even has Yui dig for info. Wonder what Asuna and the others will do when they get more info on what's going on?

Who said he won't do that at the beginning of the next episode?! =P
No way! That's Kirito and Asuna's code word! =P
11:28 - 12:10...I could watch that scene all day long!!!!!
The safety word is "Switch"
I thought it was a game mechanic from SAO. It seemed that only one swordsman could attack a mob at a time, and they had to "Switch" to change places with each other. Or was that really just a strategy that Kirito and Asuna worked out?

@cdalgorta did you pay attention to pale rider's health bar and dc status? pretty obvious whats going on......why use such showy theatrics in killing people?
I'm pretty sure Death Gun has to shoot a player who isn't in dead status yet because then wouldn't he have shot Dyne also.
I haven't read the novels but it would not have saved him, like @Abner_doon says, I'll simply add - if it's impossible to kill via the game, logically how else could they die?

@Aldones Maybe because its a tournament they might have it set so the body's don't disappear. to add it the effect of the tournament.
--Cliffhangers level: Attack on Titan-- Side Effects: Hyperactive rage, Episode Withdrawal, Explosive Otaku fangasms, unhappy school girls.
Lol! Can't really relate to the AoT comment, but I pretty much feel the same way XD. This Cliffhager is more like Kamen Rider GAIM level for me.. (Probably the other series I'm watching right now with the most cliffhangers..)
Same
MY LIFE: Good Anime-Cliffhanger Good Anime-Cliffhanger I CANT WAIT ONE MORE WEEK also theres the 25 anime which only one doesnt end and in 25 eps be a douche with cliffhangers...
This cliffhanger is nothing compare to Knights of Sidonia cliff hanger at the last episode of the 1st season.... And now i wait forever and ever.... 0.0
@AnimeJunkie18, Shingeki no Kyojin (AoT) was basically Cliffhanger: The Anime, every single goddamn episode.
=OMG he put his sword in the right spot. GOOD JOB KIRITO=
In the final episode, when it's all over and he transitions back to ALO or something, it would be kind of funny to watch him put away his huge sword by just slamming it into the ground while trying to hang it on his waist.
^since klein has a habbit of hovering behind him he'd probably get stabbed in the foot XD
Don't worry. Sinnon will get groped in front of a helpless Kirito too.
Aw Yui is so cute at the beginning when she was talking about Kirito
Those little punches were adorable.
You can't do that SAO. You can't just end it there like that.
true that
Haha, had a feeling it was going to end there. Now it's up to our brains to try to figure out what happens. I say Kirito comes from behind to interrupt the shot and Sinon somehow snaps out of it. What do y'all think? (no manga spoiler plz)
Ninja Jedi Bullet Action. Awesome.
Artless cliffhanger, but I guess they had to end the episode somewhere.

Some serious Jedi Sh*t going on right there :-D All those deflection, the people that mocked Photon sword must be feeling pretty silly right about now :-) Tho lets face it, only Kirito could do That !
Not deflecting he is literally: 1. vaporizing the shots for lower caliber 2. Slicing in half higher caliber
Just waiting for Kirito to show up any minute now


Kirito is just too badass for GGO, especially with his light saber
The force is strong with this one. ~ Yoda approves!!!
11:28 - 12:10...I could watch that scene all day long!!!!!
As a Star Wars fanboy I approve Kirito's elevation to Jedi. :-)
Although if Kirito gets angry again, he'll become a Sith lord. He'll be a bad ass with a light saber and lighting powers.
The leader of the most notorious SAO PK guild, Laughing Coffin, was pronounced Poo. All fear... THE POO!
I think there's a bug in the comments section that causes duplicates. I see this in just about every single video I watch.
I don't know, I'm pronouncing it like Po, like from the Kung Fu Panda movies
@7:00, Klein pronounces PoH as poo, quite amusing
We all stand corrected, pffffffffff (Laugh) Thank you

Okay, let me just point out a plot hole here: Did they not just finish having a discussion about the fact that Death Gun uses the AI L96 with a suppressor? The barrel poking out from behind that board was most certainly NOT L96/suppressed.

I noticed ^^. I hoped they'd notice but no...after the big deal she made about the rarity of the rifle...NOT being able to identify the lack of massive suppressor...
That's the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the barrel!
Is that a suppressor, or just a muzzle brake?
since Yui is an AI program, I wonder what her capabilities are now. Is she still tied to Kirito's nervegear or is she able to get web access to other things (or other games) from ALO? I doubt the question will be answered directly.
It is actually explained more in the next arc/light novel Mother's Rosario
She has full web access. Asuna and Kirito often use her to write research papers for class haha. I want one
You just want a kawaii Al to call you Papa.
11:30-12-30 seconds in I was just like, "May the foce be with Kirito..."
And today on "Cooking with Kirito" he will be showing us how to efficiently make a bullet salad.
Seems Tasty!
Bruhh
