No. Sachi died in SAO. SAO players used Nerve Gear which was rigged to kill players when their characters died. Amusphere did not exist until after the SAO players were trapped. The Dr. told Asuna that Yuuki
volunteered to use their machine, which was based off of the Amusphere device, which was under development during the SAO incident.
All I have to say is: "F*ckin AIDS".
God, she been slepin' in that stupid machine for freakin' 3 YEARS????
That's a great episode
So if Kirito's becomes an engineer and makes a lot of cash through his mind blowing inventions, wouldnt that satisfy Asuna's mother about her marrying into a rich family?
@Yozypost to each is own but for me is the best season ever.
@Yozypost I kind of like the absence of any life-threatening "save the world/people" plots. I only hope most viewers appreciate this as well and don't consider these calm-ish episodes to be filler. I have a job so I will be buying theDVDs
Well Asuna comes from old money. Kirito would be new money which some old money families still look at as a lower class then themselves.
Her MOTHER married into that old money.
I'm glad that the fourth segment of this show didn't just introduce a fourth game. It stretched out in more development which I'd missed since season 1. So, I'm really enjoying this season.
.... ... glad I am watching this alone and not with friends or family around. Man card might have been revoked. Damn.
Wow... Visiting terminally ill patients would be so much better for the patient and their families.
Damnit CLANNAD! I haven't been able to cry about anything since you came along. D:
Still rewatching this episode. Haven't stopped crying for 1 week
Indeed
Real men cry, it is those that are too ashamed of manly tears that get their Card revoked.

@DeadlyOats But there's also Ergo Proxy in which a copy overcomes its original... or ends up more original due to "the real thing" having corrupted/lost some of their essence thus the copy, being its core essence, is "more real"-so to speak
You know, if you think about it Heathcliff could be considered a Force Ghost at this point.
@Kiritosan3 I didn't know that was a trope. I understand what you mean but I never thought of it that way. Also, @GodOfFlash I was planning on eventually watching Ergo Proxy thanks to a youtuber named GRarkada. Did you just spoil it?
That was not a spoiler of Ergo Proxy. There's a lot more going on in that show. It's freakin' amazing.
@realsmart987 Trust me. I've watched up to episode 12 of the series. His comment sort of tells me some stuff, but it doesn't spoil anything up to that point. Also, prepare your mind to be f***ed with.
I'm a 300lb ex-military contractor and this episode has my eyes leaking. Man what a way to start a saturday morning. here, I'm not going to be the only one. Y4HRYS4NUKH
I figured that was the case for Yukki but for THAT reason... wow that hit me, literally my jaw dropped! I'll join in on this! Jan 2, 2015: W7LBS6K3F3L
I will also join : -) Jan 2, 2015: 39UEFH6HGDY
Can someone please let me know what the codes are for? I think I might have missed it
same here? I would love to know.
Me too!
Cant... Watch... Show... Through the Teeaars!!! Hardest cry I have had since I found my childhood dog dead and the ending of Code Geass.

The only reason I didn't cry harder during this than during Angel beats is because Angel Beats was like my 2nd anime ever and I WAS NOT prepared for that! D: Kevin Hart- "Noooo he wasn't ready" And Anohana is just downright Feels punch fest
Personally, all the people in the comment section braced me for this episode. For angle beats I went into it thinking it looked cool on Netflix, so I also cried a lot more for Angle Beats
I love this show

After you finish the episode, rewatch the opening.
@vw I was confused on that at first as well. Before I finished this arc in the light novels, I had FULLY thought that Asuna and Yuuki were sisters, and that that was the reason Yuuki called Asuna her sister.
It's also worth noting that, just for fun, Asuna and Yuuki are the first two characters introduced that used their real names in the games they play.
AUUUGH THE FEELS AND UNDERSTANDINGSSSS


When I first started watching SAO II, I thought, where can they take the story now? Then I realized I didn't really care what they did with the characters; I just wanted to watch them. But, now. Now, I'm speechless.
The best part is it isn't over yet. We still have at least one more episode before we all go and watch it again.
All I can say however great SAO is right now, the future arcs are going to be AWESOME! Assuming they stick to the light novels as they have been doing thus far.
I was wrong, Knowing what was coming just made it worse.
I made the same mistake of researching hit. Why do I have so freaking inquisitive?
Well, I didn't research it, I got addicted to the LN after I found SAO & marathoned the first season. First in English & then in Japanese with subs.
I've read the LNs and I'm already used to this feeling. Other anime titles I've seen prior to SAO helped; Kanon, Clannad, Air, Rumbling Hearts, ef a tale of melodies and memories, Looking up at the Half-Moon... Those can be tear jerkers.
Continued: Damn character limit. Now then... [Checks on the Shipment Status of Tissue Boxes; Currently En Route] Fxxx... They better arrive for everyone on time before season's end.
I to saw where this was headed and tried to prepare for it and now my eyes are so red it looks like i did a bunch of coke
For once, nice adult characters, receptionists and a doc who isn't a psycho creep out to take advantage of someone in VR.
IKR, what a relief!
He really seemed to love her like a daughter, the poor man must be heartbroken knowing Yuuki's time is ticking down... T_T
Did you hear the way he talked about the Medical VR system. Don't let your eyes off him.
"Excuse me Yui while I shut the computer on your face without saying anything so the adults can talk." Yui is finally getting treated like a real child!
Omg that's horrible! But I can't say that I didn't think of that when I watched that scene :p poor Yuki probably knew he had set up the meeting with Asuna though
That moment when you realize how lucky you are for having a healthy body. Sigh. This is really sad.
Can't play video! Heathcliff hacked my computer!
same
HEATHCLIFF YOU BASTARD!!!!
Worked for me.
same
I never imagined this show could take me on such a feels trip.
Anyone elses video not playing T_T

Been running into the white screen a bit recently even on older vidoes, but I can usually get past it by changing the resolution I'm watching it on. 480-720 for instance.
worked on my first go, and white screen? never had that issue.
CR appears to be under DDoS attack this afternoon: I keep getting resets from the entire web site and just posting these comments or logging in is being very difficult. Maybe College Humor can make another Kim Jong Un cartoon...
The stopping & starting of the bid almost ran me late for work......... It was worth it!

tell her your a fricking SAO serviver already!

Mm... Like... Them feels are hitting hard...
Yep yep, totally evacuating liquid through my tear ducts.



It was most likely referring to the aids epidemic which hit china really badly, long story short people were being paid to donate blood by the government, but needles were reused and blood was unchecked.. And stuff like that happened...
How do they expect me to finish this episode.........when I CANT SEE THROUGH THE TEARS!!
