But, fall damage.
Wait, how heavy is Sinon? I did some calculations... If she's lighter than 90lbs (which i doubt, no offense) she would basically fly. The force from the shot could soften the force applied on her feet when she lands.
I would LOVE to play an MMO like this...where I can just sit around with my sniper rifle and pick targets off. That's definitely for me.
without knowing the mechanics of the game it's impossible to judge how realistic her move was.
MapleStory but only from a certain height.
CANT WAIT TILL THEY MAKE VIRTUAL WORLDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



That scene of silica getting hung upside down by a plant reminded me of SAO when she was with Kirito good times
Silica Best Character IMO ^^ wish we could see more of her though In the anime ofc! xD
Liz's tiny buckler. Totally useful
But can she no-scope
Well after reading the light novel, its a simple fact that its harder to aim than it looks. Not going to explain it, but simply firing the gun isn't enough.

Other sources confirmed that her glasses aren't prescription, they are made of bulletproof material to help with her anxiety.
bjuandy you're right, because that's how it is in the light novel, which I've read.
bulletproof glasses? damn lmao
Can't wait for kirito to get his ass in that game already

Ya cant wait to see kiriko's pretty hair.
so far I am enjoying this series, and it only just started
i know dawg put his ass in there already
I think Kirito is a female in GGO to disguise his identity I guess
IT WAS OVER TOO SOON
IT'S FOR THE SAKE OF SCIENCE ARROW lol
[Sighs] LastDarkNinja and eickoff: I said not to go there, yet you guys did. And it's just as nertica said. Oh sure they start off the same at first, but they seperate from one another as their stories progress.
@anikevin Yeah that was my favorite part of the whole ep was the Alfheim scene
I don't get it. How did that twenty minutes go by in five minutes?
I get this problem a lot. I sit down to watch a few episodes and when I look over at m clock it's no longer 10 PM but 2 AM.
Pro Tip: In the game at least be brave enough to run towards the guns and die.Well said Sinon only you could remain badass and cute while saying it.
@KaeroJ Do remember the game does have stats I mean Sinon was doing all sorts of wall jumping and whatnot so I'd assume AGI would boost movement speed. @DarkJak2050 Agreed, I can't wait for her to get pwned by Kirito and get humbled.
Why? Sinon's a pro in the game. Kirito's not a pro here
@KaeroJ A 20 to 30 minute walk is nothing to me. I do that all the time since I take the bus and don't have a vehicle. Sometimes I have to walk home or to the bus when it doesn't run to where I live or I miss it or something.

@CasualPotato Dude people will flip out when they see Kirito in action.
BOOOOOM!!! HEAD SHOT!!!
Never mind reading that in an Australian accent. For me BOOM!!! HEADSHOT!!! will always remind me of FPS Doug. If you don't know who FPS Doug is google him.
fortify202: I get that much, I've read the Light Novels. But I just can't stand Snipers, period!!
First Blood! Already liking the direction this season is going in, A character that can stand on their own with their own back story just hope they don't have another pitiful love arc
No camping in this game! <3
I will say though, the love story between Kirito and Asuna wasn't hated by me. It gave enough story to it that I actually enjoyed it, and it certainly played a major part in part 2 of season 1.
The intro isn't about to give us all heart attacks is it?
I know right? Its about as bad as seeing an image of a weeping angel.
Don't look away..or you'll miss it...
Due to licensing restrictions, Sword Art Online II episodes will be delayed by 1 month in Europe, excluding the UK and Ireland. ....you poor poor souls :|.
Yeah, a month is like an eternity in the SAO world.
@theguywhoaskstoomanyquestions you should probably stick to asking questions cause it appears you cant read comments let alone correct them...
Not all hands were visible
It's on hulu
^ Which is only availiable in the US.
Looks like GGO is getting the full 24 or 26 episodes it deserves with the pacing of the show so far which is great because i loved reading GGO. Now to sit back, relax and enjoy the fantastic story to unfold
[This comment has been removed]
Dude really. Its not occasional that anime series focus on particular characters so much. I don't see how you are complaining considering Sinon was awesome throughout the whole thing.

T_T The feels....
Probably 12 episodes max, since GGO only has the Phantom Bullet arc from the LN as source.
"They can't keep their hands off each other" But they are just sitting next to each other?! -_-
its how the creator perceives jealousy through women, thus the odd fantasy way they are thinking that is going on. The actuality is just the opposite though
They just Jelly that he is taken.
That's called undying love for each other.Kirito must be glad he found someone so caring and loving.
Not all hands were visible
It's just an idiom the translator used. The Japanese just mean they act all lovey dovey.
Not much Kirito, or plot development this episode, but Sinon was BADASS, so I'm okay with it XD! Plus, seeing Leafa, Silica, and Liz at the end in ALO was great! Anyway, looks like Kirito is going to tell Asuna about his "mission". Excited!
i like seeing the pervert plant from series one as well it disabled the same cute girl, in the same way it did last time
Bullets through the head? Limbs being blown off? It's good this is all in a virtual world, or we'd be seeing some hardcore censorship.
The sad thing is that it was a teeny tiny bit toned down, but I don't mind because it wasn't that much.
Well in real life, one bullet in the leg does not cut the whole leg off.
@shippage anime nor videogames need to make sense lol
vvell if you fire a minigun that shoot so many rounds that it can cut dovvn a tree in seconds.. and if you use explosive bullets that expand on impact they could blovv ur leg off in real life too, they use those bullets on big animals.
@shippage: It actually does with a high-powered round. WWI-era rifles and machine guns would rip people up into pieces. Life in not neat-n'-clean like Hollywood presents.
It is pure torture waiting 7 whole days to watch the next episode TORTURE TORURE I TELL YOU!!!
Yeah... I'm okay with more Sinon. I was kind of like "ANOTHER female lead =_= ?!..." when I first heard about her, but she seems pretty cool, so I guess it's okay for her to be part of Kirito's "Harem" XD! (Even though I heard she HATES him
AnimeJunkie18 Sinon doesn't exactly Hate Kitrito.... Well i'll just say it doesn't last & it's Complicated. Because i don't want give big spoilers for those of you that haven't read the LN Hopefully the anime will explain it well.
EPISODES TOO SHORT
This is why I waited till the first cour was over. The torture is lessened somewhat this way. Marathoning FTW!
Through some miracle willpower I didn't know I had, I managed to hold off until the whole thing was done. Now I can watch it all after marathoning the first season again. I feel sorry for you poor souls who had to wait between weeks.
Shion is an epic badass but I need more KiritoxAsuna. I need my fix before the harem gets bigger.
yeah this episode was nothing but action sure made up for last week. it was funny to see Lisbeth and Silica be all jealous of Kirito and Asuna.
Leafa was too, don't forget about her
I missed Silica-chan so much! She looks so cute with Her little Dragon still atop Her noggin. AND, She's STILL getting groped by tentacles, and freaking Out over accidentally exposing Her Pantsu! Ahhhh, some things should never change!
"why are you taking this so seriously?" asks the guy who is literally on the verge of tears about losing in a video game.

It really does seem that the best defense in this game is a large ratty cape and a deadpan expression. Maybe seal the deal with a character name like "Banky McBankerton".
I think we all know why Behemoth carries such a large gun and poses like that....
I mean... The guy is Japanese is real life, soooo XD....
GGO is a world wide game, he doesn't have to be japanese
Maybe he is an Aussie?
I think they showed there are four Japanese servers in the first episode (though they are physically located in America)
Relax, last time I heard, Japanese girls think small things are cute
this is really starting to get good ^.^
That profile pic tho
Goes along quite well with that particular Comment of His, Methinks. XD
I read that in shaq's voice without realizing it /.^
LOL^^^
