but fall damage wait heavy sinon did some calculations shes lighter than 90lbs which doubt no offense would basically fly force shot could soften force applied her feet lands would love play an mmo like thiswhere can just sit around sniper rifle pick targets off thats definitely without knowing mechanics game its impossible judge realistic her move maplestory but only certain height cant wait till make virtual worlds scene silica getting hung upside down by plant reminded sao kirito good times silica best character imo wish could see more her though anime ofc xd lizs tiny buckler totally useful but can noscope well after reading light novel its simple fact its harder aim than looks not going explain but simply firing gun isnt enough other sources confirmed her glasses arent prescription made bulletproof material help her anxiety bjuandy youre right because thats light novel which ive read bulletproof glasses damn lmao cant wait kirito get his ass game already ya cant wait see kirikos pretty hair so far am enjoying series only just started know dawg put his ass already think kirito female ggo disguise his identity guess over too soon its sake science arrow lol sighs lastdarkninja eickoff said not go yet guys did its just nertica said oh sure start off same first but seperate one another stories progress yeah favorite part whole ep alfheim scene dont get did twenty minutes go by five minutes get problem lot sit down watch few episodes look over clock its no longer 10 pm but am pro tip game least brave enough run towards guns diewell said sinon only could remain badass cute while saying do remember game does stats mean sinon doing all sorts wall jumping whatnot so id assume agi would boost movement speed agreed cant wait her get pwned by kirito get humbled why sinons pro game kiritos not pro here 20 30 minute walk nothing do all time since take bus dont vehicle sometimes walk home bus doesnt run where live miss something dude people will flip out see kirito action booooom head shot never mind reading an australian accent boom headshot will always remind fps doug dont know who fps doug google him fortify202 get much ive read light novels but just cant stand snipers period first blood already liking direction season going character can stand own own back story just hope dont another pitiful love arc no camping game will say though love story between kirito asuna wasnt hated by gave enough story actually enjoyed certainly played major part part season intro isnt about give us all heart attacks know right its about bad seeing an image weeping angel dont look awayor youll miss due licensing restrictions sword art online ii episodes will delayed by month europe excluding uk ireland poor poor souls yeah month like an eternity sao world should probably stick asking questions cause appears cant read comments let alone correct not all hands were visible its hulu which only availiable us looks like ggo getting full 24 26 episodes deserves pacing show so far which great because loved reading ggo now sit back relax enjoy fantastic story unfold this comment removed dude really its not occasional anime series focus particular characters so much dont see complaining considering sinon awesome throughout whole thing feels probably 12 episodes max since ggo only phantom bullet arc ln source theycantkeeptheirhandsoffeachother but just sitting next each other its creator perceives jealousy through women thus odd fantasy way thinking going actuality just opposite though just jelly taken thats called undying love each otherkirito must glad found someone so caring loving not all hands were visible its just an idiom translator used japanese just mean act all lovey dovey not much kirito plot development episode but sinon badass so im okay xd plus seeing leafa silica liz end alo great anyway looks like kirito going tell asuna about his mission excited like seeing pervert plant series one well disabled same cute girl same way did last time bullets through head limbs being blown off its good all virtual world wed seeing some hardcore censorship sad thing teeny tiny bit toned down but dont mind because wasnt much well real life one bullet leg does not cut whole leg off anime nor videogames need make sense lol vvell fire minigun shoot so many rounds can cut dovvn tree seconds use explosive bullets expand impact could blovv ur leg off real life too use those bullets big animals actually does highpowered round wwiera rifles machine guns would rip people up into pieces life not neatnclean like hollywood presents pure torture waiting whole days watch next episode torture torure tell yeah im okay more sinon kind like first heard about her but seems pretty cool so guess its okay her part kiritos harem xd even though heard hates him animejunkie18 sinon doesnt exactly hate kitrito well ill just say doesnt last its complicated because dont want give big spoilers those havent read ln hopefully anime will explain well episodes too short why waited till first cour over torture lessened somewhat way marathoning ftw through some miracle willpower didnt know managed hold off until whole thing done now can watch all after marathoning first season again feel sorry poor souls who wait between weeks shion an epic badass but need more kiritoxasuna need fix before harem gets bigger yeah episode nothing but action sure made up last week funny see lisbeth silica all jealous kirito asuna leafa too dont forget about her missed silicachan so much looks so cute her little dragon still atop her noggin shes still getting groped by tentacles freaking out over accidentally exposing her pantsu ahhhh some things should never change whyareyoutakingthissoseriously asks guy who literally verge tears about losing video game really does seem best defense game large ratty cape deadpan expression maybe seal deal character name like bankymcbankerton think all know why behemoth carries such large gun poses like mean guy japanese real life soooo xd ggo world wide game doesnt japanese maybe an aussie think showed four japanese servers first episode though physically located america relax last time heard japanese girls think small things cute really starting get good profile pic tho goes along quite well particular comment his methinks xd read shaqs voice without realizing lol
