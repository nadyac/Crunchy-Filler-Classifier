That Toma guy sure likes to walk fast everywhere he goes...
Haha I like Sanosuke laugh especially when both he and kenshin laugh over Kaoru's comment lol
I find it amazing how it took sanosuke so long to realize that the kids are the next target. How dense are these characters?
He's not an audience watching an anime. He doesn't expect everyone to have horribly despicable methods.
I can't say I have much respect for filler episodes, but this arc is at least looking better than the one-shots immediately preceding.
I don't like that a filler character was put to the same power level as Kenshin and even the disciple seems to match him. Let's see if I'm wrong in the next episode.
Remember Kenshin is not that strong if he does have the wish to kill his opponent.
