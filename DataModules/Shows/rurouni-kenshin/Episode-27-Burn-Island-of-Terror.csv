Today on Dr. Kenshin.
My god, everyone is so suicidal in that day and age. It's like the first thing they resort to when anything goes wrong. Poor Kenshin always gotta save 'em the last second.
Damn I get a small cut on my finger and I'm out for a week, she get's shot and she's running already like it was just a small punch to the knee lol
man kenshin got all these girls falling for him
I like Shura. She's pretty and reminds me of Chrismas with her green hair and red eyes.
Really liked this arc. Thought it would be awful at first, but it really shocked me. Shura reminds me of the Assassin chick from Gintama, who Gintoki kind of got feelings for. All aboard Kenshin x Shura fanboat
Shura ja nai! Katsura da!
Actually no. Gintama hate sachiko.

Kenshin, not just a man-slayer, now a Lady-Killer
I have to wonder why the good boy had that kimono old this time in his cave and what has he been doing with it. xD
You either see the worst in everyone or you like thinking about young men... one of these things is deplorable.
Why is everyone attempting suicide in every other episode? .__.;

I like Shura but Kenshin x Kaoru forever <3
I think Shura's my favorite female character so far..
After this episode things start to get a little rough.
