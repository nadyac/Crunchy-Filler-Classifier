fr 127 fire power second dsr 50 its because math not real oh man wish just put entire series up one go could just binge watch yeah some serious flipping out done really well can really see somebody flipping out hyperventilating because know somebodys out going try kill again after all time but now guns but then your dopamine receptors would become immune sao awesomeness because youd flooding too much good thing waiting keeps excited wanting more ive read light novels kirito did mentioned about raiding laughing coffins hq but wasnt really shown light novels although im glad a1 pictures actually animated raid keep up a1 dallnatt same here went binge read staying up over 24 hours some cases pretty much binged sao over two days its an awesome series well block anways will hard beat still great damnit why cant time skip saterdays harem grows better watch out asuna wellfounded confidence hes never once shown slightest interest anyone but her were married kid game over kirito hefty experience watching anime learned harems always grow one golden rules harems asuna primary sinon secondary die fire kirito logic gotta back up even though kirito about so aiming his left leg sinon liar know third one protect his third leg all occasions um do all times going make him girl anyway supposed rex rex kwon do voice lol bwahahahahaha only could give two thumbs up comment hilarious can someone please explain why kirito refuses ever mention sao game do people not google would think name kirito would pretty well known throughout mmorpg games people werent instantly killed died sao ten second delay so before brain fried thats why asuna didnt die because kirito cleared game before could could also kayaba decided make her not complete death process set amount time per request kirito think everyone forgets air uncertainty regarding death sao still active no actual proof died sao died irl least not sao players themselves outside communication wa prohibited bet lot lc members used uncertainty finality death sao justification actions game even though no problem murder sao dont assume killing irl would easy told about sao people would know exactly who would able train themselves stronger than him thus would become next impossible him do well ggo ah shared ptsd never thought would way woo girl mani just dont want stop why must wait another week torture also heard sinon kirito dont get romantic each other but seems shes gonna like another liz side line babe waiting asuna leave this comment removed one girlfriend bitches what player literally hes beater gets all bitches might say hes bitch beater wait now sounds like im condoning domestic violence think all know someone says its impossible kirito kirito always breaks barrier fought sao two years climbed top rankings experience since translated into becoming warrior well least confident na author just likes make his main character over powered deus ex machina rescue because saved every shonen shonenesque character since forever im kidding but can tell by now will overcome anything comes across would gamble life savings kiddo dont think an op character nessesarly bad thing its all do will sinon finally take kirito friendly gesture would asuna furious saw kirito do another girl find out next time onkiritos wonderful harem somehow dont think asuna would like bit end its cuz made her seem incapable protecting herself kirito wasnt around shed died long ago only cuz made her seem so weak compared kirito towards end which much more independent begining shown couple scenes her maybe solo killing decent scary looking mob maybe collect dinner materials surprise meal kirito so something along think most people would feel differently about her volume sao theres scene shows asuna going agro labyrinths month into game sao progress vol lol just noticed xd kiritostill smooth ladieslol
