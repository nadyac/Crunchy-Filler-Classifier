Thanks for the nightmares...
Finally the new arc has arrived, but am I the only that is going to miss these endings? I always looked forward to what sexy women they would draw next lol
MAAAAAAAAAN Sometimes I wonder why I watch this show
So what you're saying is this isn't from the manga?
Sniff.. Sniff... Sniff... MEN! Sniff... Sniff.. Sniff... MEN!!! (I was sleeping after I watched this ep and I actually dreamed of this. It was terrifying. ;-;)
I'm sorry, but that was horrible. If they are going to run episodes like this one, I'd rather not watch it. At least next week is a new arc.
9:35 THEY EVEN GOT SHIROE!!!!
I saw Lupin III at one point....
i noticed it too!!
Loool MEEEEEN. The Happy men at the end! Lul!
What Lupin where? I totally missed it!
10:41 Lupin and the Gun Guy LOL
Is it just me, or did I see a hint of some NaLu fan service going on? <3
"The Walking Men"
nice
Ba dum tsss!
@p21kid Punny XD
Best episode 10/10 would watch again
and i would rate up again!
This comment made me laugh so hard... i don't know why, LOL
Because, MEEEEEN that's why :- )
So glad next week we're back to canon because I seriously need my Tartarous Dose..
Lol, they make it look like becoming MEN is worth than death
Becoming Ichiya, Trust me... it is! x_x
It can be at times...
YES, NEXT WEEK: TARTAROS BEGINS!
yess
Shouldn't this be more suitable for Halloween or April fools?
Lucy was in the bunny suit so should it also be suitable for Easter?
Not to mention April Fools is in a few days > -> <- <
This whole ep was a giant easter egg.... At least, one that has been sitting out in the sun and melted.. MEEEEN....
So did anyone notice Shiro from Log horizon? lol he shows up at 9:37 lmfao xD
Yeah, I was like, Hey, that's Shiroe! ... He's been SNIFFED. 0_0
burn them burn them with fire
Um... Who wrote the episode description? Because Ichiya is NOT the guild master of Blue Pegasus.


I loved that one! It was in the manga too, VERY witty, Mashima-san.
This episode was scary.
eh what did i just watch.... men
Funny to see this in anime form right after the chapter came out in the manga. It is actually even scarier this way...
This is the episode I have been waiting for since I started watching this show. This is heaven... this is MEN
tfw you think the sexy picture is of Ichiya
Honestly it should have been; keep the horror going.
Finally, some MEEEEENNN service
And now for something that will terrify you when someone starts sniffing around you.
