watching this show, makes me realize how scary having friends it is, I'll just keep staying home for now
And that's where anime comes in :p
feels like I'm watching a Soap Opera
the bruises and sprains of today will make relationships easier to deal with tomorrow. with experience comes the potential for wisdom, and wiser actions toward finding greater joy. if you are going to stay home, invite some friends over.
Or, the bruises and sprains of today damage you so much you're terrified to make a move in the future without years of therapy. Don't let fear rule you, but find your joy within yourself. Then you will be confident facing the world.
@sunflower33 without getting into a prolonged discussion, I acknowledge that can happen. Even so, individuals can control a lot with regards to their own hearts from bringing joy to resisting pain. Learning how to do so is key.

When the s**t hits the fan, some guys run and some guys stay. He did the latter here.
For Kakeru's challenge to Yukinari, I think it was more about seeing Yukinari's resolve to pursue Touko. Based on this idea, Takayama got mad because she didn't want to see Yuki's resolve as well as him potentially getting hurt.
I think the point of the challenge was to show that Yuki couldn't have Touko even if he won and it would only hurt Touko if Kakeru never saw her again.
You could say YES!, becuase Yuki unnecessarily over-reacted
Man Okikura is boss. He knows that no matter what Yuki does Touko's never going to fall for him while Touka not seeing Okikura anymore would be breaking her heart. So in reality Okikura's just been nice trying to help Yuki move on!!!!
Well, that episode was just a cluster fuck.
As soon as he said that, I was like "Oh, he just earned a slap!" After Yana was already feeling unwanted, now she's a consolation prize?
Still, he achieved his objective: Yuki and Yanagi left together. ^_^ It seemed to me he was more concerned with how they felt about each other than how they felt about him.
^^ so true
Ehh David was acting like a dick purely to push the the siblings together so that no one would wind up hurt in the end besides him. Pretty sure Touka recognizes this as well and it was pretty blatantly obvious when David smiled afterwards.
"David" didn't actually want the girls to be prizes - he wants people to stop being indecisive and actually do something.

He certainly does care about Touko's desires. He just has to struggle between the feelings within their shared glimpses of the future and the present. He chooses to trust their connection while attempting to reveal it to the others.
What Okikura wants is for the others to start making definitive decisions instead being wishy washy punks like Yukinari.
All Okikura wants is Touko, he doesn't care about being punched or whatever.

I think its all a means to cope with his social awkwardness. For a guy who tends to be very distant from others, it seems Touko is the only one he is comfortable around. Dat harem
The pairings are much more obvious than Nagi no Asukara but I'm still expecting something bad to happen...Still, I'm glad that Touko and Kakeru are being more open to each other
I agree. Nagi no Asukara got quite frustrating in the middle because nothing was happening. A guy confessed, then the girl ran off in guilt for not having the same feelings. At least things are slowly but surely moving in Glasslip!
Nagi Asu was agonizing! And I'm not expecting this to be any less painful; conflict makes good drama & PA Works like to wring every last drop of drama from every conflict you can imagine (& some that you can't!) Dont expect to get off easy!
With all the drama and punch's being thrown, looks like Hiro and Sachi are going good!
Touko already saw a bad future for Sachi.
I don't think she saw anything definitive about Sachi's future, just possibly that things were more rough for her than she was letting show. I'm sure Hiro will help make a difference in her state of health also, even if it's not as lovers.
I know! It's like they have their own little show while all the drama happens to the others.
The only thing Touko saw was Sachi in the hospital, there were no other details. And I agree that Sachi is more of a yuri-inclined girl and shes just being friends with Hiro... just Hiro doesn't know he has been friend-zoned - yet.
WHERE"S MY KISS SCENE <<<< IM WAITING FOR IT
Don't hold your breath!!
Oh god I love Touko. Her reactions to things are actually perfect.

Probably a sib then.
Maybe his mother is a ghost! Wouldn't be too farfetched when you remember this guy can see the future.
He can only hear future events,Touko is the one with future sight. He can only have visions when she is around, and vise versa. They also can't control what they experience.
Hmm- well Touko was around when he opened the door so first qualifying event cleared for the visions event.
Maybe she and her son have the power to leap through time...
Knowing what happens means you can enjoy it twice. Mind. Blown.
It's like reading the manga then watching the anime.
I've honestly had this experience before..this anime is special. Such things are becoming more common in our age, especially for the younger generations. You might not believe me, but I'm so thankful for this anime. It really can help many.
no if the anime were 100% correct adaptation we could enjoy it twice but its usually not cough cough tokyo ghoul, akame ga kill etc your essentially experiencing two different things for the first time now the same thing twice
don't forget Soul Eater.
First, Yuki punches him, then Yana slaps him! But Kakeru didn't hit back. Good for him!
mad respect for Kakeru
Yukinari is a loser. He demands answers from Kakeru on his relationship with Touko, but then punches Kakeru when Kakeru is inquiring about Yukinari's response to Yanagi's confession.
Teen angst is very powerful - it can reduce the IQ by dozens of points. but Yukinari owes Yana an answer and soon.
[This comment has been removed]
@mistersaxon...Yukinari never seemed to have dozens of IQ points for teen angst to work with. By your reckoning, Kakeru was punched by a turnip!!
It's not a GlassLip episode unless Touko says "EHHHH?!" at least once.
Really? I figured from Nagi it was Manaka screaming "Hii-kun" sometimes followed by "wait up!" since that god played out so many times. Welp found the other drinking game for people. Take a shot each time Hii-kun gets said by Manaka.
Now I'm tempted to rewatch those shows and try the drinking games out. That'd be tough
Finish it off with a helping of Miyuki and oniisama.
we'll call an ambulance for hmattt. Good luck man and God's speed.
want a drinking game .... desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu and breath
got to feel bad for David though, a punch and a slap in one episode
And he's still winning. The punch and the slap were worth it.
Just because he has a little bit of clarity in areas that the others don't, he steps up to take the hits for all their sakes in order to get through all this love jumble quickly. Still doesn't mean that it's not confusing and hard for him.
I love how some of gang keep referring Okikura as David xD
Yeah and half of the people watching probably think his name is David too, I look at the comments and almost everyone is calling him David...
xD Oh man I can't tell if that's intentional or not!
I refer to Okikura as David because it's less characters so I can type more. God knows how many times I normally hit that 240 character limit.
yeah, if I comment on an episode I will call him David. Simply because it's easier for a few others to recognise and put a name to a face
I don't birds fly that way...
I don't also talk correct.
A new breed lol
You mean the brown birds that were kind of just flying in one spot? It's very common to see seagulls fly in one spot because of the wind blowing against them. Although there were two birds facing different directions flying in one spot.
Yeah, I've seen birds fly in one spot before. But the different directions is new to me.
I bet Hiro didn't mind that the fireworks festival became a mini-fireworks festival with just Sachi and him.
Dammit Jonathan! You were supposed to help them make up! You're the main character! Stop eating dirt from the ground!
I thought Jonathan was going to stop the fight or something.
@PhantomGundam I see what you did the---DDDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Just wait til that chicken starts posing.
Okikura might have acted like a dick, but Jonathan is the real cock here.
Nah, that's not Jonathan. That's actually his evil bro Dio passing himself off as him. We need to find Josuke and the gang ASAP! I think they were last seen heading towards Egypt.
Touko and Kakeru are the cutest.
Plot twist: OMG Touko was wearing hand protection while working with glass! Finally!
