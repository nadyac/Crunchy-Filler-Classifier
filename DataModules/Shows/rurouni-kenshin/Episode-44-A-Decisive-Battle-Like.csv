Sanosuke giving Saito the finger @ 3:50 LOL
lol, I wonder if they censored that out for the English version
They practically censored it in this version lmao (dub version). Without that comment the subs covered it ;D
dang nice find xD I had to replay it once you wrote that.
i noticed it on the first try only because the animation changed and it seemed "sillier" then his finger did that hahahah that's awesome.
Wow.. I hadn't even noticed that until I saw your comment. heeheeheh! Sano you are just too awesome sometimes. XD
I love that as the series progresses, Saito becomes less murderous and more humorous.
LMAO I couldn't agree more man.

That cloak's not doing it for him. Oddly enough, pink suits him.
TOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. xD
Sanosuke is Awesome 8D This Anime is Awesome!
Sanosuke is a frickin badass.. xD
Having survived, what would Seijuro Hiko's name be if Kenshin had accepted to rename himself that way? xD Or maybe there would be two anyway, after all the name is like a real title.
Seijuro Hiko the 14th xD
This Intro is starting to grow on me...
Lol that suit on kenshin is so ridiculous.
