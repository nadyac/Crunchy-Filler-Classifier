It's good to see Kenshin again, glad CR picked it up. This episode has one of the most memorable scenes with Kaoru and Kenshin. The music is: Pietro Mascagni: Cavalleria rusticana - Intermezzo.
They had really turned up the production value on this ep, I wish it could have looked this good w/ every ep. Great to have it here on CR! Still wish they'd make a new anime series, follow the manga, use some of Watsuki's 2006 redesigns.
That piece of music was perfect for that scene. T_T Thank you for informing us what that piece of music is and who it is by!
That ending, Battousai the Heartslayer.
I feel bad, but this made me giggle.
Such a beautiful scene....
When you see Kaoru cry, you can actually feel how her heart breaks and you can't help but to shed a tear as well. One of my top faves scenes in anime ever.
So I'm not going to lie. I actually did cry a bit..
Im sorry... I didn't cry, I was happy that kenshin was leaving to become a wanderer again
Kenshin is the perfect role model. He is such a real man. ;_;
That he is.
HAI
Poor Kaoru.
A grown man just cried at the end of this episode....
I feel ya man ;__;
Have to watch this on May 14th.
It's getting really good; I love it when things change! Exciting!

That little scene at the end between Kenshin & Kaoru? That just breaks my heart. :|
most beautiful episode T_T
Still like Shura better
"Secret technique: Dear Ken the Pet".......kinky much?
omg noooo, my heart D:
Too bad they had fillers in this anime, but when I think of great Samurai animes, this and Champloo are the top 2, and only 2 for me. <3
a man's man, true heart breaker ;(
MY HEART. T___T
Ahhh .. I see. Kenshin is a closet schizophrenic. It all makes sense now. Here's to hoping his manic side wins!
I don't think you fully understand what schizophrenia is. If you did, you wouldn't call Kenshin one..
