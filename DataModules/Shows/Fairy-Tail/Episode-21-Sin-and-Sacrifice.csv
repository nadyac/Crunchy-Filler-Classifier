"Did you kill one?" "NOPE JUST BROUGHT IT WITH ME!" Had me laughing so hard! Every time I see Sting, he reminds me a little more of Natsu
it totally reminded me of him and the voice and sounded like natsu's too
Just goes to show Sting was hiding a lot of his real emotions there.

at first when that first shot made contact I thought "ok, one shot. Gray will survive." then 7 more shots "ok that had to hurt but maybe Gray will still..." -headshot- "you know what? Nevermind, IM DONE! IM DONE!
Yea, that's how I felt. Although, call me a maniac, I was smiling during it. Are they going to kill people in this show now?

Milliana shouldn't hate Jellal, he was manipulated.
well because ... *imitating Happy's voice* He liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikes her
BAM Head Shot, just to make sure
They sure are meticulous, for antagonists; even more so for runts.
Admit it though, after the first shot your reaction is "He can survive that," then the second round says "he'll be crippled for a while but..." third round: "he's dead Jim."
Nooooooooooooooooo graaay!!!
What will happen to Gray? worries me



they are messing with time.. i can already see them killing a bunch of people then just reverting all of it, from my understanding of time that scenario is complete bullshit though.. and the fairy tail members you saw would still be dead.
agreed

In the Manga the situation looked more fatal because of the lack of blood in the anime version ^^
I wish anime was more consistent when it came to blood/gore. I know it has to to do with the timeslots most likely but recently it feels like there's a lot of censorship in this area. I just think it helps communicate the stakes.
I like to imagine that the magic dragon laser things cauterize the wounds.
Pretty sure cauterizing your heart and brain is worse than not cauterizing...
Everflux, Fairy Tail was actually originally geared to children, despite this fact part of the lack of blood gives the animators... more freedom in a sense, such as with the phantom lord arc. When scenes are more gorey, fights tend to be
kept shorter, or less fight scenes are actually showed. The animators have shown in the past (Natsu vs Gajeel) that they can do brutal scenes without blood, and part of me thinks they have an advantage due to censorship at times. More to do
WTFFF??? I was about to joke about Juvia & Gray and then that happens... I'm officially shocked!!!
I know right that was just wrong in every sense of the meaning of the word. and right in front of juvia to ;(
not that i don't like gray, but i think it would be good for fairy tail to go with the not everything has a happy ending route



OMFG that ending... How fucking dare you end the episode like that!
NO. THIS IS NOT OKAY. YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT LIKE THIS. WHAT THE HELL
its ok, its going to be ok. next episode they will just find all the dragon balls and wish everything back to the way it was....oh wait this isn't Dragonball Z is it?
@Kuroixmachina I agree, this is utter nonsense!!! LIKE WHO THE HELL DOES THIS KIND OF THING TO PEOPLE, THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SHIPPED AND CALLED CANON ON THIS EPISODE!!!
Why did the manga seem to have a much faster pace than than the anime for this arc?
Here's a handy tool. Go pick a chapter. Write out the lines. Get a stopwatch. Read them aloud while timing yourself. You'll see how utterly implausible it is to animate a show directly as it's written. It would just go too quick.
Who cares anyway? We get more Fairy Tail (and other anime) that way, as a manga reader (not for FT yet, but for other shows), I can tell I want extended material wether I read the manga or not.
Well there's flashbacks that rehash the already padded parts of past episodes. It wasn't too bad in this episode actually. They kept them pretty short. Not that they don't exist in manga. It's just they don't usually get reused.
Omg, how about the last 40 episodes of hunter x hunter...where almost ALL of those episodes spanned over a period of maybe 1 hour...:S
Well, I'm behind in Hunter x Hunter like 50 episodes.. LOL
Flare: "STAREEEEEE"

WTF, I spotted a what looks like a Fairy Tail tattoo on that part of the episode. It's on her boob.
That is the Raven Tail tattoo it looks similar to fairy tail but has a different design on the head portion
I think shes crushing on Lucy now xP
We got a spoiler right here ^
That ending. Omg why. Just take my feels. ALL MY FEELS. (also, honestly what was so important that you HAD to tell her RIGHT THERE -facepalm-)
You mean what was not so important... That was so hard to watch!
He was probably telling her to focus on the battle
He will probably survive and, when everything's over, he'll be asked about it and it'll turn out to be something about her butt and we'll all laugh and feel fuzzy and tender and bake cupcakes filled with hopes and dreams... right?
@handsomedead unless fairy tail is disney well a shot through the head umm I really doubt Gray survived which is bullshit I gonna go cry in the corner

Sting confirmed for troll. "NOPE I JUST BOUGHT ONE ALONG SO WE CAN KICK FIGHT IT TOGETHER BRO".

With the way he was acting, it felt like Natsu was rubbing off on Sting a bit ^_^
Sting has always look up to Natsu anyways xD
And they are similar in some ways, like, Sting could totally be a protagonist on a shonen manga, along with Rogue, similar to Gon and Killua.

Them onions get them away
Gray: Juvia I need to tell you something. Juvie: Yes, Gray-sama? Gray: YOU HAVE FINALLY PUSHED ME TO SUICIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh god... I support Gruvia but that was so damn hilarious
I know Gray is ok (just a guess because Fairy Tail), but I still find it cruel. I'm still sensitive from that ending :'(

This is Fairy Tail anime, bruh. If you want to see *more* blood, read the manga. The lack of blood is the only thing I don't like about Fairy Tail.


Does she sacrifice herself for Gray or something? Like using some forbidden time spell?

what a depressing way to end my night.

she still had roles in the next arc but little ones
nooooo prepare urself for the water works coming :*(
The irony of your comment is striking.
and here i was thinking i could live on without having to learn to speak japanese. well crunchyroll sure showed me wrong.
CR right now: "gg scrubs"
