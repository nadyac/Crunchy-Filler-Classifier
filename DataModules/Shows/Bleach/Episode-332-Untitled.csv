that scream at the end from Regai Byakuya sounded a bit gay... he shouldn't scream... he should just fall quietly to keep his calm reputation... lolz
Regai: AAAAAAA~ *gay scream* Real Byakuya: No No! That is NOT how it is done. You are a shame to my presence.
very true he doesnt sound like that at all... ruin his calm cool reputation, and they would be all dead if it was fighting like the reak one by now, he goes to killing blows as fast as possible
This proves that nothing and no one can imitate Byakuya. which makes him such a badass
Does anyone else realize that Genryusai could get his arm fixed/replaced by having Orihime Heal him up? If she could do it with Grimmjow why not the old man?
I don't think the old man would be up for that, I think its like a battle scar for him, to always remember the mistakes/sacrifices he's made in battle
Also he's never been the best at accepting help from others... especially ryoga.
and where are the Vizard? or Ichigo's dad? Heck, this is filler, where are those three Mod souls from the Bount Arc? Illusion and teleportation would be really useful right now...
"When I get back, I better clean my sword." lmao!
Dang, i thought she was going to turn into Captain Planet when they combined their powers.
lol... "He's got us cornered"... umm aren't you flying in the sky? can't you go pretty much anywhere?
I love how Ichigo calls Yamamotto old man haha
He's lucky we owe him .. That is all i have to say.
anyone else enjoying the endings? I am loving watching flashbacks of old eps
i love how they incorporated whats happening in the real story in the filler. about how ichigos losing his powers of course. better than just taking them away after he became a god!!!
I miss godly inchigo, that shit gave me the chills when he said to aizen that he was the one movin mountains XD
I KNOW RIGHT!!! HAHAHAHA GODS FINEST HAHAHA
so what happen to the recaps so people who dont want to see recap can just watch the show recap end @ 2:30
did anyone else notice that Nozimo's weapon is almost exactly like Ukitake's? the only difference is that Ukitake has two swords
Meanwhile humans are just experiencing severe earthquakes.
EWW Toushirou bad guy voice sounds incredibly gross and perverted in a man-love way.
ikr I mean the "lets play, boys" kinda sounded like a rape threat to me :/
Hearing Byakuya make those noises... it's so weird. lol
BACKLASH WAVE....wait wrong show. LOL
Nozomi's Zanpaktou powers are nearly identical to Nel's powers. Not only that but they both have green hair.
I cant wait to see Nozomis Bankai!!!!!!!
you will never see that because she's a weakling she doesnt have one.... only shinigamis finest have bankai, what you think this is? lol
well bankai kinda lost its badassory when grimmjow deflected it with his hand
uuuumm...where dafuq r all the citizens at? its like the place is a ghost town
Omaeda is the biggest pussy in this show. kon kicks more ass than him
