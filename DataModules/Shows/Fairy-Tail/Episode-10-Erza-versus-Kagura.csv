Totally forgot that was a reveal, read this chapter months ago.
ehh they do have the same hair so i guess it works

@djangosp7 i see what you did there fuckin love that anime X3
So the future Lucy will have diet success, learning new things everyday!
Could it be zeref disguised as Lucy he he he he
But she smelled like lucy. Maybe he should taste lol
she has boob reduction
maybe it's Levy in desguise or something :/
@phrosty when girls lose weight, they lose it all over, breasts included. Same goes for weight gain.
Those feels. Time to go back and watch the Tower of Heaven arc. Thanks FT.
Those were my thoughts too
Check out how many people from that arc become badass wizards
Erza and Jellal? I mean, I don't find Sho, Wally or Milliana badass. Simon was badass, but, well...
Miliana was tougher then the other two for sure

Was thinking the same thing. Almost feel like its time to watch it all from the beginning again.


What's interesting is they didn't pull from the first series... they actually reanimated that entire scene.
Yeah Felemoth you're right. Lol I noticed it too, they probably didn't want to let us see the difference on the quality of the animations .. this one is a bit crappy, Levy looked all malformed in that one scene ...
holy f*** i was not expecting her to be THAT strong. I knew she was strong but holy crap


I think the guilt he feels is forcing her to hold back.
Knowing Minerva, she probably pops in just in time to deal the finishing blow and claim the points. I mean, points matter, so why would she allow one of the two captains to get more points by finishing the other off?
@camerohaden no is a bad idea for anyone can use eclipse for their own benefit, meaning the time of the past can endanger the present and the future.
Dude, Erza feels are the worst. I just want her to be happy forever.
No no no no no no no no no NO! You can not leave it at that cliffhanger. Quick! Who has a time machine they can let me borrow?
Hahahaha but he didn't run over anyone; why would he be looking for one of those?
Well even if you did find one you would need 12 keys to open it
Damn, all I have are four keys and a locket...
I have a banana and a microwave, plus a smartphone think I can build a time machine with that

I love your profile picture! :3
I thought it was because she was Milliana's friend (and her friend Simon died) so yeah
@raccun that wouldn't be deep enough for that kinda hatred
I think it's rather annoying that hatred like that can give so much power, it just gives the wrong idea about how to become stronger....pretty much all anime corrects this implication quickly, but still
@Pokenerd93 Hmmmm Who says she wasn't powerful to begin with, I mean she might be strong because she knew she had save her brother from the Child Hunters, just saying not necessarily hate plus shes saving her friend whilst Erza feels guilty
FUCKING CLIFF HANGER

Emsignoretti, I don't think her eye can really be called 'artificial'. I mean, it's functional, and has even been shown to have gained its previously lost ability to cry (unless they just forgot that little hook). Would suck to lose it...
I forgot she lost her eye. Lol
Ya, didn't you notice? In this episode she was only crying out of one eye. I think she can only cry from her fake one when she is truly moved, like the end of the Tower of Heaven arc.

How is that a spoiler?

SERIOUSLY?!?!!? We waited all week for this battle and it still barely happened!! ARRRGGGHHHHH!!!! *heavy sigh* Next week looks awesome too though.
ya. wish they cut some of the flashbacks and had more battle time!
That was straight Dragon Ball Z/Naruto Shippuden games.... aaaaaah!!! *Punches a wall* I guess I just have to wait til next week...
Haha, I'm working through Shippuden and yes....this was that. Still Fairy Tail is way better with filler. Next week will be epic though!
Am I the only one that finds Kagura sexy when she is badass?
I'm in the boat with you.
Nope Kagura <3 Sexy and strong!!!
I was kinda entranced by her since her first appearance. She has that waifu material something.
nope your not the only one
I like her bow, she's adorable when she's not pissed
TIME FOR THE BATTLE OF A LIFETIME -nosebleed- :3


I was kinda baffled by that too. I mean, I thought they would keep the other studio's non-blood tradition, although it could be that that blood was necessary plot-wise (like Gray's frozen blood) or for the cliffhanger. I hope I'm mistaken.

Where the fuck is Gildarts when you need him?
hes having a staring contest with the lightning god slayer, you know the important part before any great battle.
@farvaB wow, are you retarded or just a troll, that's Laxus
Can't wait until Erza gets her hands on Minerva!
Trust me, it'll be worth it!
She's the first character I've wished an excrutiating death upon badly since Jellal. Although currently, Jellal is maybe my favorite male character, I don't think I'll ever like Minerva, no matter what kind of development she gets.

it is just me or did Levy's breast suddenly get bigger when she's suppose to be flat chested?
well in the early episode's she is bigger, then shrinks.
Levy's breasts are a freakin roller coaster. Like a kiddy one. You go high in the beginning and then you go on tiny hills for a full circle before doing to again.

This went by way too freaking fast
