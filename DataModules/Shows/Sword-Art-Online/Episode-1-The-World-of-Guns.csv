@CluelessProgram The LN explained tho the government wasn't able to interfere with SAO out of fear Kayaba would pull the plug, they monitored the players' progress and knew Kirito was one of the highest level players on the front line

Plus the transitional movie (SAO Extra) explains that the government has access to players logs which show who was where when, but they does not tell them what actually happened and how things went down. They need someone to explain events
@CluelessProgram it's because of the game log data. When the 6000 people got released from SAO all the game log data said was the location of characters. The government used that to find out he was involved.

Death Gun appears to also be capable of killing CR servers
So an anonymous guy can kill people without even touching them by giving them a heart attack? Man, this villain is a complete rip-off of Kira, just he uses a "Death Gun" instead of a "Death Note".

Im sure his name is a bit more creative in Japanese. "Shi Ju"
sup bros
shi+ju= forty (instead of yonju)? A dictionary said "shiju" was "teacher" or "scholar". Urban Dictonary said "incredibly hot and irresistible" or feelings of sexual arousal or "one who takes it from men", but UD is like that w/ all words...
Damn, I didn't realize I missed Kirito and Asuna this much....
Yeah, I know. They're doing a really good job of tying it all together without letting you forget the important stuff from SAO and ALO. Great job Kawahara-san and Aniplex!!!!
had to rewatch the first season again just to prep for the new season!
I just now watched the first season and made the poor decision of watching this right after. No now I have to go watch a little bit of Gintama to wind down from the last few episodes... And that filth only referred to as glasses guy.
five bucks says we crash crunchy roll via the amount of streaming
Iwas smart and waited to watch it. it hurt me to wait but no lagging or crashes happened for me
There's no doubt about.. it'll crash again, but on the bright side- SaO is back! WHO CARES! xD
After hearing about what happened last week, I'm actually glad usually don't catch episodes of my anime when it first premieres. I wouldn't be able to take last week
I was trying to watch Fairy tail a few nights ago and couldn't, then my site crashed this was the cause, maybe
yh i was having some proplems aswel but i got it going um sometimes it just go next episode without knowing through the episode but yh. who care's now hehe
I can't believe it's already been two years since the first season. I remember how much I enjoyed watching the episodes that aired that summer, time really flew by! Anyways, this season looks to be great!
Technically, you're all right. In a sense. This is season 3 for the reasons Vicky stated. It's also technically season 2, since the first two arcs went together. Like SoniaFirestorm said, it has II because it doesn't go with the first arc.-
Personally, I think it should have II like it does because it's a completely new arc, with a different story. So, you're all right, no need to go into this further, have a happy day. xD
Okay, cool then.
Technically though, this isn't the third arc. There's more in between.
it will take another 2 years if there is season 3
Mysterious heart failures? Death Gun? Time to revive L from the grave
Wow, a Death Note/SAO cross-over sounds.........FREAKING EPIC!!!!
[This comment has been removed]

Yes. L must be revived from the grave. AND THIS TIME HE SHALL LIVE. (He basically won. And no offence to Near and Mello lovers, but they never would have solved the Kira case without L...)
Death Note is literally the first thing I thought of when I saw the death guy. He reminds me of Yagami Light.
Welcome back to Sword Art Offli-
LMAO..
Trololololololol
xD
Lol, if only
LOLOLOLOL

You're right, Kirito is so OP he doesn't even need bullets, just carry around two sniper rifles on his back like he did with the swords and swing them around like bamboo sticks.
Actually the way he put it in the LN it should have been a knife fight all along.
@splintercell i work for Beretta and i can assure you that her sniper is no Beretta. if it were at best it would be the Sako TRG-22 and the highest caliber for it is ether 338 lapua or 416 rigby..... just saying >__>
@decentintotheinferno shinon's sniper rifle is the Hecate II which is the heavy sniper rifle the French army uses.
The hype is so strong that even crunchyroll can't handle it <33
I decided it would be best to suffer through a few hours instead of risking slow or non-working video.
Everything on crunchy roll lagggggging... but the streaming was ok. This episode was too short. I'm ready for the next one.
I missed the premiere at Anime Expo yesterday, stoked that I can watch it here!
Worked perfectly the next day - YAY for time zone differences making it easy to wait a few hours
i love tht pic XD
So Kirito is a trap for the second season?
[This comment has been removed]
Noooooo, I really dont want that dammit. Ugh... I mean having a cool female character join him sure, but i want kiritoooo T_T

Incorrect. It's a rare "Model" that appears female that is only obtained after so many hours of playing in the... thing.
if he plays as a girl im done... not really but yea
Well ladies and gents, that whole fiasco with the refreshing 50 times on different tabs, CR under maintenance, and the comments being disabled to stop the massive overflow shows how many of us love SAO, so lets keep looking forward to it!
Wow! So that really happened? I just now watched the episode, so I'm ashamed I wasn't a part of that! Though, I'm sure that was annoying, too XD...
Fear Not... the mobile app still works while the server is down
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS CRASH THOSE SERVERS
This many people loving this anime means that the only reason they would stop making it and airing it would be that something bad happened to the people making it and they couldn't do it anymore. SAO has such a huge fan base
Here we go again!
The exit is right up there in the top right corner. You are more than welcome to it
if you dont like it just do not watch it
lol doctor odds mine is in top left corner i use a mac so i say to who dont like it exit in top left corner no need for coments on how u dont like something if u dont like SAO then y u came here
There is no exit. The only way out is to complete the episode or die. Thanks for playing.
well put football_star well put. lol
LOL iGlass.
I was thinking literally, like " woah... some kind of vision glass for your eyes" * looks over to the tv, sees a lens crafter commercial* " Damn"
Can't wait to see this "i Glass" in the year 2025 lol
This is the future, instead of hyping up release date expos, they are cleverly sneaking them in animes
Morgan Freeman has already admitted to testing out iLids.
ilids,funny x)
THAT BOOTY THO THAT SNIPER SHOT THO THAT LIGHT SABER THO THIS ANIME THO

IRK!!!!!!!!! i loved how they did that. vary smart op art work/sequence guys/girls

...I kind of hope that Asuna does like yuri, tbh. : x
That was a serious camel toe trying to get free of them shorts. Weren't it though?
LOL we crashed Crunchyroll... That's pretty much like the 1st day a real MMO... LINK START!... Loading... Loading... Loading... Emergency Maintenance...
that's so true, happened to me plenty of times xD
to the best of us my fiends to the best of us.
Wow, and SAO blasts right back into our lives with a huge bang and a very interseting plot.. Can't wait for the next episode...
You won't be disappointed! The Biggest Problem will be waiting for the next episode.
I'll pay you this much.... what does three fingers translate to in yen?
Pretty sure it means 3,000,000 yen, which about 30,000 murica dollars(give or take some obviously) This measurement is pretty common for anime and even more so for drama. Millions of yen is handled quite often.
Remember, this kid is still in high school and when he looked at the prices at the menu he was stumped. He's going nuts over $3,000 USD IMHO. Life is cheap I guess.
IIRC He said Kirito-kun gon' get about TREE FIDDY
A penny for your thoughts, Kirito? No, more like a slice of cake for your SOUL. This guy comes at a bargain price.

[This comment has been removed as well] <3
Is this really a thing now? Comment trees that no longer have origins? O_o
lol
tentical rape, hmmmm......sounds familiar
LINK START !.... ANDDDDDDD The SAO Fanbase is BACK ! ! ! (Not like we ever left pshh) The Hype is real... We crashed the WHOLE FUCKING site ! It's good to be back.
Looks sweet on my 37 inch TV/Monitor.Tho it would be nice to have easer to read text like FT
So if Kirito wants to be a creator in the future, does he create the NeuroLinker for Accel World?
:O blown ma mind
yes lol i was thinking that too i think he does because he and asuna mention aguemented reality so much
@CoffeeGodEddy That would seem fitting.
Next time Ice sniper? More like next time more maintenance/streaming problems, refreshing fiascos, commenting problems, and lastly but not least, Kirito as a girl XD
@juju, i started with fairy dance cause i had watched the anime for SAO arc and wanted to know what happened next, read them in order from fairy dance - alicization uniting
I've read all the novels available in English and so far IMO it goes Alicization>GGO>Mother's Rosario>Fairy Dance>SAO. Fairy Dance tops SAO due to the underground chapters that were excluded in the anime. Strictly my opinion though.
i found the LN version of Fairy Dance and SAO about equal. i would have liked the anime version of SAO to have incorporated the "First Day" episode from volume 8, since it also incorporated "A Murder Case in the Area" from the same volume
also, i kind of wonder how much his initial writing suffered due to him having to convert the material he originally had on the web to satisfy the publishers as a new author. once he was popular he probably could write what he wanted.
