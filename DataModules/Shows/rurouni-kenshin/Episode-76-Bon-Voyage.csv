It's amazing how almost everyone Himura beats ends up being a friend. Himura also never seems to lose.
Well he probably would have, but that bandage guy basically killed himself. Other than that, yea lol right? His therapeutic sword fighting combo is awesome.
Every time I fought with someone as a child and young teen, we also became good friends. Then again, weapons weren't used, but the premise is sound. There were a few exceptions, but those had special circumstances. Not too, far fetched.
nothing like leaving a dent a couple inches deep and several feet long across another's chest to say, "Why can't we be friends?"

It was doubt. The show explained it very well. "This guy" was filled with doubt, insecurities, and fear. Shishio was sure of himself and his self-righteousness to his core. It makes sense that the former loses easier, even if stronger.
*sniff* Sayo~
Such a powerful arc and that music... so beautiful
