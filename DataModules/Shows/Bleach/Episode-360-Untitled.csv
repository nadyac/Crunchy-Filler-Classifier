this entire arc has become so annoying i cant deal with mistaken memory shit ugh
"TIME TERRS NO RIES" mmm japanese people and L's I love it.
is it just me or does ichigo always get cut on the shoulder
i was thinking the same thing hahah
Aizen was a cooler badie

My mind is so full of f@#$ right now...
Holy shit! I did not see that coming at all!
***MindFuckingBlown***
f**king Bleach needs to stop having flashbacks of the previous episode that takes up half of the current one... its annoying.
Not nearly as bad as naruto and flashbacks
just wait for a show to make a recap episode of a recap episode

But dizzy, after that sudden turn. It kinda makes sense if you think about it. At first, I thought Ginjo was an enemy, and he indeed is, so, yeah, I'd say I am where I started. Maybe...
the show stays on the air almost all year round, so cheer up alil on the pacing, recap, filler/fluffer gripes silly geese, its not so bad compaired to the average 10 hrs a year we get from regular t.v. Love it,but fuck censorship
recap over at 5:38 ISHIDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT A TWISSSSSST!!!!!!
I wanted to say that. I love robot chicken. Great episode, glad I'm catching up and can finish the show tonight.
Best rape face in bleach, yet.
.......What just happened?
