The sentiment is appreciated but Kenshin and Saito are right.. they would get in their way and become burdens. Still, there is no guarantee Kenshin would come back afterwards even if he succeeds.


I dont know why but when Saito threw that uppercut I heard K.O. like in street fighter
Seeing someone else mope like that makes me feel ashamed when I myself mope.
Floor's gotta get cleaned somehow and sweeping alone won't cut it in most cases. So mop away! xD
Kaoru is quite annoying when it comes to Kenshin...
I thought i was the only one who thought that... XD It seems as more and more epis come, she gets more annoying and gets quite useless too compared to the beginning of the series.. :/
Its like shes 12 and fawning over some kid in a band.
Nope not the only one...I wish she would just stay out of his way and let him fight. It was her getting involved that almost got Kenshin killed in the pirate arc.
I don't think she's annoying, she's realistic; what if the love of your life left to become a slayer and possibly die? I know I'd probably be like Kaoru
Too many emotions in one episode, I MUST CONTINUE!
Love seeing this series again... own the dvds and each time i see these episodes I remember the outtakes from the dubbing and they're hilarious.
the fight of Sanosuke vs Saito was like watching a boxer fight a martial artiest, Sanosuke: WHY AREN'T MY PUNCHES HITTING HIM!!!?? Saito: Because the only thing you do is punch randomly.....i block.
Overall I like Kaoru but she seriously needs some development. What happened to taking care of herself with her own strength? She needs that back and to grow up.
Oh my glob! Aoshi!!!! OwO
kamiya is a stupid selfish little girl. my least favorite, she'll just get in ken's way
Megumi's memory must be getting fuzzy because I KNOW Kenshin didn't say all of that to her back when she was about to take her own life.
Im going to admit it, everyone going to kyoto makes me very nervous. But emotional support is important and who knows what kind of crazy suicidal mission Kenshin would go on without Kaoru and the others to ground him.
So did Kenshin use an "It's not you, it's me" or an "It's not me, it's you" reason to break up?
