all in favor for kenpachi and ichigo to have a all out fight in the future say AI!!!
"I don't plan on dying even if i get killed" rofl
I want to see Yachiru fight so badly, i want to know the reason she's a vice captain at her age i know she's badass

Only because Kenpachi wants her to be his vice captain. You don't have to be strong to be one, I mean hell look at Omaeda
no, Frankton. did you see how in previous episodes, she was really fast?? Though I agree, Omaeda kinda weak...
wait, kenpachi vs. kenpachi? how is the universe still intact?
I know kenpachi's zanpakuto is always in shikai but If yachiru is kenpachi's zanpakuto I wonder what his shikai's release phrase would be. I vote for " Go play, Yachiru. "
I want to see yachiru fight!
I love the after-credits part on this one. Poor Isane...
the new animation style fascinates me so that I forget to be bored no matter what--
I finally get to see Unohana fight. Her character seems so quietly CREEPY, Ya know? Anyone that can creep Kurosutchi out has got to be a bad ass.

LOL Byakuya at the end "I will be the first to arrive" "I will be the first to arrive" haha
Zetsu from Naruto must have watched this episode and used Kagerosa's strategy
Nice episode. I want to see Unohana fight and prove why everyone seems so frightened of her strength.
it would be epic if that girl on kenpachi back had a regai lol
Why is the opening so much cooler than the rest of this entire arc so far? -.- Finally got to see Kenpachi fight himself! Now for Unohana!

For how destructive he is that'd probably be bad news for everyone. Guy is already like a nuke blowing everything up what would happen if he had bankai?
"i dont plan on dying even if get killed" ....thug life
HAHAHAHA Kenpachi's dirty kick at 4:30 made me laugh a damn lot !!! XD XD
lol Kenpachi look has changed a bit. Nonetheless Kenpachi is awesome! And Yachiru is CUTE!
The fact that Kenpachi's zanpakuto is so jagged... it must hurt really bad to be cut by it
