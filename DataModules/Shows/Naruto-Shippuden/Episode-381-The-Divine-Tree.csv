Gonna treasure every episode from here on out! T_T Here we go! **(^O^)**
The manga is ending in 5 or so chapters. I'm glad the anime is finally "catching" up. Expecting more filler soon about kaguya soon........
People are acting like because the manga is ending soon, so is the anime. We still have a LOT to get through before the anime is going to end.
Get ready for the fillers!!!
Anime will be done by next year probably
nahh in 10 years, the filler is real withing this one
Im gonna miss this anime... Lets enjoy it to the fullest!
the manga in in the next few weeks. The anime has a VERY LONG time to get near where they are.
There's at least another 113 (if done 1 ep. = 1 ch. w/ no filler) episodes for the anime. 1 per week = 113 -:- 52 = 2.01-2.05 Years of anime left. Assuming there's filler, it'd be more like 2.20-ish years.
only 50 chapters left to catch up to the manga so ill say a year and a half the latest.
Anime is nowhere near done.
My vote is on Gintama.
Now we're just waiting to see exactly how the divine tree mythos and the theft of chakra was really Danzo's fault.

And maybe if we're lucky, the Sage of the Six paths himself can lecture us about how wonderful, self-sacrificing and perfect Itachi is/was/will be.
He was a dick, no redeeming factor in his whole character

Why is are you guys even talkin' 'bout Danzo? Don't tell me he had a hidden-forbidden jutsu to reanimate himself, too! Even so, he's late in the game. He'll show up, just to pull a Sai, and get pwn'd early.
"you're a bigger idiot than my elder brother", lucky i'm home watching this.. safely laughing like a crackhead
The Ten-tails has more forms than Freeza ._.
Odinsknight101, that wouldn't happen to be a Soul Eater reference would it?

Ah! so, ten-tails has about um...6 forms? no no that can't be right
I get that the 10 tails is the Divine Tree, but is it the other way around? maybe Divine Tree is the Ten-tails?
How can this happen? The Ten-Tailed has so many forms ...
Is it me or does it looks like there's only about 200-500 shinobies out of the original 80,000 before the war? At this rate there will be no point in having five cages or missions or anything. Shinobies will have no point to exist anymore
I can see a good ending where the ten tails'/six paths power resurrects everyone after the final climax.
#RESETBUTTON
@ x3tripleace3x. That is not gonna happen. This war is the real stuff. It's impact is final.
@anime_pops But you have to love how the ultimate attack misses every character with a name.
They killed Neji if you forgot
what a suprise all sasuke does is be really salty of how much better than him naruto is without having to be a sadistic emo
DBZ started all these shows that we have now. Naruto same thing as DBZ 1.Main character who starts out weak then gets stronger to protect his friends around him. 2.Has a Close friend who is also his rival that turned evil.
Well on Team 7 Naruto started as dead last and Sasuke was #1. now it's reversed. Sasuke is dead last and Naruto is #1. Naruto worked harder than everyone. Sasuke tried to go for the easy power up. No wonder he's lacking now.

@jctsoi Sorry, but Sasuke isn't dead last. He's still far above Sakura....I understand you trying to ignore her existence though.
Edward, Gohan as a kid = Younger Sakura, a.k.a., useless. Teen Gohan = ALL THE INTERESTING. Adult Gohan = Eh... Ok.

Great now i can never trust a tree >_<
i've never trusted trees sense that one kept eating my kite all those years ago.
So the woman takes a bite of the forbidden fruit and it curses mankind?
@Hoopeterz. Adam and Eve? :O
I was thinking of Blast of Tempest..... that can only mean one thing Aliens....
We are Groot.
Sasu-chan is jelly of Naruto's chakra
Chakra envy lol
You mean the Kyuubi (-_- )
no ^ not the Kyuubi. Naruto's. Because he's able to control that much power, and trained so hard to achieve that strength.
Meheheeheh, Maybe not x)
Everyone's all supportive of filler now
[This comment has been removed]
NO filler NONONO. I'd rather this show ended now than to watch the final arc of bleach again.
@jujitsu213 but the final arc of the bleach anime wasn't filler (i'm assuming you mean the fullbring arc).
This episode was so sick, I can't even put it into words. I don't even care about the art and animation. Never have, really. It's always been about the story itself that makes me so addicted. Sorry, but this episode gets a 10/10 from me.
"The barrier is down now we can fight alongside Naruto and the others!" -- Allied shinobi forces gets wiped out by tree
"I know your not a idoit!" *pause* "OH CRAP!"
He just gets easily overexcited.
That, and he's an idiot.
Im gonna miss this anime /:

I was thinking the same thing...
i thought reanimation give a etrnal supply of chakra
I think he meant the Chakra used to perform the Flying Raijin jutsu that's been placed on Naruto has its Chakra drained meaning it's disappeared so he can't teleport to Naruto.
So in the end, when everything is said and done, Kurama is still a tsundere...
Love how this turned into symbolism involving Genesis.:D Tree of good and evil and the one fruit that no one is suppose to eat, Then a woman the princess ate it.
whoa somehow I never drew that connection. good looking out
In Blast of Tempest there were two trees. Exodus and Genesis. Answer: Aliens
Atleast sasuke has front row seats
haha surpassed all the previous hokage in stupidity. yup that's naruto for you and i love how there's so much difference with kuramaxnaruto relationship compared to before
