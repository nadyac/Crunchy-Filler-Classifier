Is it just me or did some of the pirates not seem human but more like humanoids?
I was thinking maybe this is a boat-load from MiddleEarth. There seem to be a lot of...goblins.
8:46, Uh, that's not what the Moon looks like. If it's larger than a half moon, it should look convex, not concave.
Okay guys, so bare with me on this question...its a bit of a noob one :S What exactly is up with Kenshin's grammar? Is it just the way he speaks, or is it some sort of mechanism in the japanese language? GIMME DAT FILL YO!!
I think it's just something in the language that English might not have. And to have the same effect, the translators add this. I've seen other subs and it was never like this though so I'm not sure.
Oh sweet, thanks for the extra insight Looks like I'll have to do some more personal studies into the Japanese language.
That was a confusing answer, Kenshin does speak a little differently from normal Japanese. In the manga he always refers to himself as "this one." In the anime they put more emphasis on the backwards Yoda-speak.
The short answer is that Kenshin speaks extremely humble/polite Japanese, which doesn't translate well into English. Both the "this one" in the manga and the inverted grammar in the anime subs are attempts at translating it.
This is Edo-jidai (Edo period) Japanese, since this anime takes place from Edo-Meiji. Japanese samurai were depicted as talking differently , using "sessha" and "gozaru" a lot as this is seen in kenshin's speech. Stereotypical of it though
Finally a real lever-action rifle from the west, I was getting tired of those worthless muskets.
There have been so many filler episodes, when will any of them be main-plot relevant? Wait... What is the main plot again?
I've heard it's after episodes 1-28
does it matter? Just enjoy it because it isn't like they are going to be more episodes after this. There are 94 episodes and that is all there will ever be, so chill, and enjoy.
Kenshin was so ready to die in this episode, that is mistake. The producer of this filler didn't understand Kenshin's personality as someone who needs to continue on living to find an answer for how to repent for his sins.
Yeah, it was a a little odd. At first I thought maybe he just knew Shura wouldn't kill him. But then he was all soaking up his last moment in the sunrise and...yeah-no. That's not what the Kenshin I know would do.
I have to disagree with you two. I felt like that scene showed how he is a man of his word and the deal was his life for Miss Kaoru's. Since her life was spared Kenshin has no regrets.
I think the poison clouded his judgement a little, personally.
