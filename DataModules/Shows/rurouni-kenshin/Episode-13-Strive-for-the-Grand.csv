I'm guessing he said that because they are in the Meiji era now, and samurais are illegal.
not samurais are illegal, wearing a sword its illegal only the Imperial and the Police are permitted to wear swords.
With a reverse blade sword no less!
Well, well. For some reason I wasn't expecting a second end theme to appear already.
You too can do sumo if someone pinches you in the butt

Nah, I think it's beautiful. Dubbed doesn't really have the same effect as the subbed
To be honest, I enjoy the dubbed version as much as I enjoy the subbed one...they are what they are. To me, each has it's own merits.
For a show with a historical Japanese setting, it just feels more authentic to have the characters speaking in Japanese. For that reason, even if the dub is good, I find that a show like this should preferably be seen subbed.
