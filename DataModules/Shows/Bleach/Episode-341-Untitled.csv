kudos to whoever keeps fixing seretai. XD
aha but what about the filler where they put on a movie to raise money to fix the seretai?
Don't count it on the account I probably skipped that one.
One filler episode Vs. a filler arc, with examples from the main series as well. Hm... Which one sounds more legitimate?
Hey reishi is matter too, it cost some $ to buy it... kind-of... Also it's hard to get 100 or so reishiitects with enough experience to deconstruct material reishi and reconstruct it into buildings, food, supplies, etc. (how I imagine it)XD
reshi is diffrent to spirit energy so that wouldnt work
That poor plateau get's beat up so much it's a wonder it's still there.
Used to be a mountain. With a peak.
O.O that plateau has been better times.
I wonder how they end up fighting there all the time. I mean, it's not like they just happened to pass that place on the way to somewhere else; it's a hell of a climb!
Who cares its not like its a plateaupus...
The plateau only survived this episode due to plot, because there's no way it'd be standing after that last getsuga tensho from masked Ichigo.
I'm just in awe of the quality of the filler this time. Just an excellent ride the whole way through and then back to the story. All with excellent endings attached as a sort of drawn out curtain call for the show up to this point. Superb
remember when this show was about shinigami fighting hollows?
It wasn't ABOUT that, it was about Ichigo Kurosaki.. a shinigami, who took of that profession because he needed to fight hollows to protect his family.. its about Ichigo protecting his family and friends. Get it right beotch.

I was just thinking the same thing zoka lol, if all the soul reapers are here who's stopping the hollows?
the afro dude.
Yeah duh, the afro dude is taking care of that.
How many times has the tip of that big ass rock fallen off now?
Yeah, I bet it's a pain to put it back up there every time.
Has anyone noticed that when they fight on that hill that the same end piece somehow gets cut off?
Good job! I never noticed that.
BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI BANKAI lolololol end credits ichigo lolololol
..................................................
.......... agree......
You guys don't get it? Ichigo says bankai several times before he loses his spirit energy at the end credits.
Ah simply beautiful! EPIC! Thumbs up if u replayed that scene again.

Daamn I thought it was 1000X better than the final Aizen fight and it was kinda like a movie I though it was an epic episode
the explosions just got more and more epic
Best filler ever for Bleach.
Why cant Naruto take a lesson from Bleach, this is how filler is done. What an amazing arc, not to mention that was probably the best animated episode of Bleach I've seen. Thank god for Bleach.
With the emo chick gone, Kon can finally return to the shadows where he belongs.
-SPILLS MILK- LOOOOOOOL
That must be one strong hill to withstand all those explosions..
how about the columns that don't seem to fall no matter what happens! LOL
Not even Final Getsuga Tenshou would be able to destroy those things.
Somebody make that hill a captain! ;D
funniest of all!
Kon, you're such a pervert but that's what makes you funny.
it would be a mistake if they let kon go back to the real world with that body and plus Capt. Myuuri Lt. would go and shred him up if that happens lol

I kinda wonder who's reishi Kon was created from...
Kagerosa didn't create him...
If Soul Society had insurance, their premiums would be through the roof. Everything always gets DESTROYED D:
Urahara said that he could only bring back Ichigo's shinigami powers (so no Hollow power) with the Reigai technology but yet Ichigo is using his Hollow powers in this battle
That's because Ichigo went through the transformation already. Don't you remember? Right before Rukia and the others came.
his hollow powers are his spiritual powers, or basically make up part of his spiritual powers.....if he awakens his spiritual powers he also awakens his hollow.

Lol I didn't get that either... They did make it a point to say they couldn't awaken his hollow powers, but.... then he turns into a hollow and nobody says anything. -.- Wth. xD
He only lost his soul reaper powers, i dont think he ever lost his hollow powers. Thats y the hollow eventually took over him and went berserk.
The graphics of the action scenes in this episode are like FLCL
