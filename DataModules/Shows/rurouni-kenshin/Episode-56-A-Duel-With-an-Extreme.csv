Kenshin's style of expert swordsmanship mixed with intense emotional therapy is pretty awesome, gotta say
Well I must say, this side of Sojiro is better xD
Couldn't agree more!!
That it is!
The Inferno Room is the HYPEST ROOM EVER!
I want one!
God I love this anime. It shows that people are not bad by birth, but by the actions that they carry out. In essence you also bond with the antagonists. You feel their pain in their back story. You feel relief when they realize everything.
You are so right, sir!
The Inferno Room. Welcome to DIE!
Damn this turns into a massacre now.
