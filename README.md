# The Crunchy Filler Notifier

### What?
This system notifies users if a show on Crunchyroll released a filler episode recently
### How?
It does this by visiting the Crunchyroll site, going to a show's page, and extracting the comments for the latest episode.
It then processes the comments and performs a Naive Bayes classification to determine if an episode is more likely to be a
filler episode or not. Then it sends you back the results.

This is my Spring 2015 Software Engineering project
