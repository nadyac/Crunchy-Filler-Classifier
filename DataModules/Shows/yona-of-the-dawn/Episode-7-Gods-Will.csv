Yona is such a troll lol. "Hak you've been a good boy lately, (pats head) there, there...
It's typically the other way around, too. Next thing we know, Hak is going to start showing off his inner tsundere.
...but he already is. Has been.
Tsundere manly men are the best
That's why i'm the best. "Flexes"
So... Hiryuu had a dragon harem?
Apparently so and Yona wants one too.
ah genetics, tis' a frightening thing indeed. :-P
So when do we get the yaoi harem prequel series? >:D
I was getting a Negima vibe from that story. A predecessor with a yaoi harem, the MC getting an opposite gender harem.
@Darkmagick8 LMAO your comment made my day >w<

yup i agree
Someone's been reading Romeo and Juliet.
I don't think I can say enough how pleasantly surprised I am that I'm enjoying the show as much as I am. I can't be the only one who just checked out the show on a whim, and is now watching every week.
You should try the manga
Someone posted a few pics of it on tumblr so I thought I'd check it out. The art is great! I like it so far.
I was totally bored just browsing crunchyroll, decided to give this a try, and am now sacrificing my health and sleep.
health and sleep are so overrated
@xgraceling literally same.
This OP will never get old nor boring. Its so beautiful, light & refreshing
@domvina: indeed!
I really like the feel of the opening. Anothe one to watch is Natsume Yuijincho. Awesome opening feels and great song to go with
I love Natsume Yujinchou, I'd recommend!
Natsume Yujinchou is one of my all-time faves!! Always feel good after watching it, like Mushi-shi.
@Kaytana: Almost no spoilers? I must be seeing things then...

Most MC heroines: "OMGsh he's so close...I must back away flustered and blushing!" Yona: "I thought you wanted to check your temperature so I stuck my forehead out..." Lol I love this show! ^_^
It's going happen...one day. Probably. And when it does, there will be much rejoicing.
I really like this show. She's a refreshing type of heroine. She's weak and a little slow sometimes but determined and has no hidden agendas.
the kissing scene will happen when you least expect it.
not gonna happen he is lika a pet dog to her and she is a Sakura
I somehow get this feeling that Yona will keep that ornament with her until the end where she'll use it to stab and kill Su-won or something. That would be so ironic. Killed by his gift to Yona.
Maybe she'll use the ornament as an arrowhead and miraculously shoot Soo won with it in the last episode to put a creative twist on it (instead of just stabbing him). I know that won't happen, but a man can dream.
Some hair ornaments can be used as weapons. There were Edo-period kanzashi designed for decoration and defense. So that flowery hair stick might actually be sharp and strong enough for Yona to effectively stab Su-won. *crosses fingers*
@Resident_Gundam - Unfortunately, emotions don't come equipped with a handy on/off switch. She's loved him her entire life. No matter how hurt and betrayed she feels, she can't just throw away everything she felt all those years so easily.
Yes, I don't think she's keeping it because she still loves him but because she loves the old memories that ornament reminds her of...of the hope and dreams she geld onto before she found out he was a douchebag haha
Or maybe he gave it to her for a reason, knowing it's sharp. Maybe, like last episode how he said that Yona and Haku wont be by his side, he knew she'll become stronger and gave that to her as like a foreshadow of when she needs it.
I really love this show... It's really well put together on so many levels... Story wise, character wise and action wise... Let's have more of this!!!
The characters are believable in their roles.
Hak eats what he wants, when he wants! That is all.
I think it should be a universal rule that if you fall off a steep cliff to save someone and survive the drop, you should get whatever you want. Besides, the poor man can't even get Yona to kiss him; at least give him some food!


So everyone with red hair is a red dragon? The only real thing that shows that is that her eyes gave it away.

It just feels strange to see that this time it's the girl that's oblivious to the guy's advances instead of vice versa. Poor Hak. He didn't want the temperature of his head, he wanted the temperature of her lips.
It IS a shoulo series after all.
Well to be fair to Yona, if her head wasn't full of Soo-won, she probably would have noticed Hak by now. It is hard to notice other people when you are as in love with someone as Yona is with Soo-won.

even wondered why guys like Hak don't Exist in this world? Life isnt it not fair!!! I wanna Hak!!
we all do...
i will be your hak! I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE!
They were all Friend-zoned long ago.....
I reckon I could say my fiancee is a Hak; we've been together 6 years and as long as we've been in love he has always been supportive, but also protective, a passionate lover but also my best friend. To me he is always by my side and I his.
you lucky beatch lol xmirror. I'm madly in love with hak, if he dies tables will be flipped

Cool! Yona and Hak are off on a quest!!
Nice, they finally have a goal in mind! The story is finally coming together.
Yona has chosen to really fight and be strong. Can't wait to for the next episode !!! (taking the temperature of your forehead.. ha ha ha denial is a wonderful thing)
The opening got an upgrade! It looks better than before!!!
Hak shield Yona, takes a poisoned arrow to the back as a result, falls off a cliff, shield Yona again to ensure she doesn't die from the drop, & before all this has already sworn loyalty only to her. Forget medals, this man deserves a kiss!
"It's alright. The god of death hasn't come for him yet." LOL that's reassuring
