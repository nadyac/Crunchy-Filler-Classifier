Did that bicycle just fall over from sheer awkwardness?
It was the ghost of past friend-zoned guys, they warned him...
the episode should be named "bike"
It was certainly a device to portray the mood of shock.
The bike fainted, I could see that happening
the bike was like "bruhhhh"
I came for the CHICKENS!!!! WHERE ARE THE CHICKENS!!!!!!
@baka_caca ok, i think i figured it out. the chickens found out that the family was having chicken for dinner, so they ran away. the only logical conclusion i can think of
They had chicken tonight for dinner + They "bought" chicken and the freezer was packed they said. You do the math
The chickens! Will somebody please think of the chickens! *sobs*
hhmmm an anime about chickens.... YES!
They FRIED the CHICKENS!! R.I.P Johnathan ?-2014
Alright guys, has everyone graphed out the relationship web yet? Quick before everyone is confused when it gets complex like in NagiAsu!
Does a couple ever like EACH-OTHER & get together right off the bat in a PA Works series? I know it makes for good drama & all that, but instead of spending the series getting together, couldnt some-one spend it breaking up?!?
Hiro -> glasses Yanagi -> Yuki -> Touko -> Kakeru -> chickens
@willyp2k but kokoro connect was so simple in terms of romantic interests. They more or less spelled everything out for us in that regard.

oh my the first comment is on point

School Days?
Anyone else getting major Anohana vibes? I adore this anime so far, I love the supernatural twist on it!
Nagi no Asukara vibes are super strong.
I'm guessing its the same studio??
Yeah it was produced by the same people who did Nagi no Asukara so we should probably prepare ourselves for massive amounts of pointless crying...but I'm still praying they don't go that route again. Don't get me wrong I loved that series.
Just too much crying.
Still not as much crying as "Tegami Bachi". THAT show had a LOT of crying. Good show though.
Wait... Yuki and Yana aren't brother and sister? What is their relationship then?
I think in the character promo they are step siblings, so they aren't related by blood
All kids in anime are step siblings - just to complicate things
Step Anything or second cousins (for Japan at least) is the only way to even remotely make Wincest well, Wincest. (Oreimo flashbacks) *shudders*
First cousins are ok in Japan, and a good chunk of the rest of the world I believe.

Oh damn, a love confession on Episode 2. But I think Hanasaku Iroha still holds the record for having one at Episode 1.
There was nearly one in Kakumeiki Valvrave but it was kinda interrupted by an invasion :/
and not to mention plenty of Death which you know puts a damper on stuff like that.
You mean like 99% of most confessions? Either the moment gets blown up by someone or something interrupting... or they just can't spit it out.
my little monster anime has a confession in episode one too and the main character dosent just say I like you he says I love you
Yeah My Little Monster has the quickest. I mean both protagonists actually talk normally with eachother, both confess to one another, and share a kiss in one episode where as Kimi no Toke takes 2 seasons to achieve that...

Ohhhh dear. The bells of foreshadowing are a-ringing.

I swear this is Nagi no Asukara 2.0
which is not a bad thing at all.
Well, this and NagiAsu are both made by the same company, so it makes sense.
I think the Kokoro Connect vibe is stronger than the Nagi no Asukara - and the ED reminds me of Hanasaku Iroha. And those are both Good Things too

Oh god.. I can tell this is going to get extremely complex extremely quickly.. good thing Nagi Asu taught me how to deal with this kind of stuff beforehand! Well, sort of...
Hell, I'm already lost on who's who.....



whyyyyyy-for the love of the Sea God- do people read the comments section before watching the video? Common sense dictates that all comments will most likely concern the content of the video -_-
Well it's obviously so they can complain about spoilers. I can't see any other reason why they would. Well, I suppose there are those non-subscribers hunting for guest passes. Either way, reading comments = spoilers.
LOL.. feelings so strong.. it floored the bike
Poor guy... "Thanks" easily ranks in the top five worst things a guy could hear after such a heartfelt impromptu confession. o.O
To add to the humiliation, she got on her bike and ran away.
What? My heart went out to all three of these poor people. Props to Yana for recovering her composure so quickly after that one. (Almost impossible?) At least she knows that Touka isn't responsible for what happened at all.
Ya that failed miserably. Poor guy, at least he spit it out. Hopefully he'll realize that Yana is the best girl for him.
Instant FRIEND ZONED.
That confession was so powerful, even the bike was floored!
Alright.. I have all the ships I want to go together. Let's watch them crash like they did in NagiAsu. T_T Kakeru x Touko, Yuki x Yana, and Sachi x Hiro
The ships set sail -- and suddenly a heavy plot fog rolls in, and the love radar is out! o.O
This is NagiAsu all over again.
I like you. Th-thanks. Bike falls down. Runs off. I think that went well.
Her reaction was perfect. Made it less awkward.
damn it hikari! go after manaka! oops wrong anime
That confession was so awkward even the bike felt it.
Wow, that escalated quickly.
okay, so she can see the future...but...what IS she seeing? everybody's being hit by a train? ooooor is she seeing next weeks episode of Rail Wars or something??
