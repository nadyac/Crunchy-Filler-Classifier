I think we found the titan that Dot Pixis would like to be eaten by

People would have boners for a mikasa titan. I bet mikasa gets titan form later cause why just eren?
it was the injection erens dad gave him

thts what i thought.........
I'm never ever talking while riding a horse. Ever.
When he bit his tongue, IT HURTS ME ALSO.
The first time I saw him bite his tongue, I was so surprised that I burst out laughing.
same here deadlyoats... but i laughed really hard at it
Luckily, its about as common to bite your tongue while riding as it is while walking. Idk what kind of idiot talks with his tongue out of his mouth hahaha
love how everyone else can have giant speeches on a horse no problem, but that poor guy can barely get 10 words in without almost removing his tongue XD

@bugufan i like one piece but its so long you have to spend an astronomical amount of time to catch up with the storyline
@ivancandymafia It's really not. HxH is great during all parts. @FurbyLover Agreed. It's fine if other people like it, but it is incredibly unappealing for me at least. I can't get past the first few episodes.
INCLUDING LOTS OF KAWAII TITANS. WTF IS UP WITH THOSE? SERIOUSLY.
That was awesome, this anime always has to be over the top and I love it. And the soundtrack at 19:00 is amazing!! These next few eps are definitely going to be crazy!!

But dat kick doe.


love the kawaii titans too
damn is that titan a fucking crab or what?
@cherryblossomey if it was a cat, it would be cute and fluffy, not trying to eat humans, have no fur, whisker or other cat physical attributes.
Cats try to eat me all the time...
I'm laughing so hard I cant

lol it's so kawaii tho
Did she look familiar to anyone else?

The person in the blood rain is Armin. And the girl clenching the fist in the undershirt is Mikasa.
The eyes never lie.
SHE WANTED PATATOS!
definitely, those eyes...

@gonzalez007 trust me its not mikasa. Its someone at least for me when I was reading the manga didn't expect.
Well, Reiner did get hit by a full-grown horse flying towards him and didn't even seem to break a rib. Pretty sure a normal person would have been crushed or heavily injured... So whatever

dude, its called fiction
@Killstof Eren certainly doesn't keep his hairstyle when he shifts, though.
THAT FEMALE TITANS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!
+1 million
11/10 would bang.
No man can bang that. In the land of Titans; she bangs you. lol
Dat Ass!!!
lol quicksilver
My heart was racing the entire time the abnormal titan was chasing after potato girl!! D:
It was creepy as fuhh too. Poor Sasha. u_u
/watch?v=1mUmQIP2520
I am glad potato girl survived.
patato girl is becoming to useless T_T she needs to get her head in the game
i was so scared i thought she was going to die > . <
fuckin crazy good episode. loved how it focused on armin, reiner and jean this time


Since Reiner got out of her grasp, I'm thinking she caught him without crushing him. The blood spurting was her's from his sword slashes. MIA's: Eren's Father, Armin's Parents. Anyone else notice how hard they're riding them poor horses?


You mean the guy who said that you can kill a titan by shoving a sword up their ass?

thats because it ..........
...is
Annie reminds me of Olivier Armstrong from FullMetal Alchemist honestly
We use to have to play crab soccer in highschool. Your butts facing down and your trying to hit this huge ball without getting kicked in the face. I think I like the titan better. There were just to many girly-girls in my class. lol.

it cant be over i swear i just started watching this episode. what do i do now ?
You could watch this week's episode of the Fate/Zero dub....
I know the feeling. It was bad enough before Valvrave ended, and such. Now it feels I just wait for a few shows a week. Come on FALL! October! New and Second seasons start!
Re-watch Gurren Lagann.
Re-watch Gintama, or any other epic anime.
Sword art. Watch that.
After what armin said, why did reiner move his hood after going to help? Weird...
@kiseki_ace Actually it is the corps commander that is suspecting that their are traitors and spies among the humans. Levi is just following orders and being an all around bad ass.
Man the plot thickens as to who the enemy is . Interesting though Eren's position was not revealed I guess due to prevent another incident like what happen to their captive titans
Maybe I'm imagining things (it happens from time to time) but I swear Erwin specifically said, last episode, that he wanted to conceal Eren's precise location from most of the corps. But exactly why, he didn't say (or I forgot).
I think Reiner removes his hood because if he go for the neck, the Female Titan will attack him either way.

and now to wait another 6 days 23 hours and 35 mins
#thestruggle but..TOTALLY WORTH IT
AND...now to wait for next Saturday. BOOOOO. I want moar!



Reiner was most certainly crushed, I mean come on now. I think most people can conclude what's happening.
agreeing with jmayer97 on this. Eren's blood never evaporated while he was getting beat at his trail.
I think that Reiner use his swords to scratch the female titan's hand then the smoke bomb to escape.
Somehow I feel like there were some clues in there that I didn't quite catch. I might have to watch it again. The end at least...
I think you'll pick up on quite a few things if you re-watch the series at this point.
The biggest thing bothering me is the picture that they show at the end of the ending with the two walled cities fighting each other. I've been speculating with other friends who haven't read the manga and it seems like we're getting close.
There was a big spoiler for certain character in this episode. Not the titan.


A warning for all of the Non-Manga readers: Never read the comments. Just completely ignore them. People make these comments trying to be insightful and analyse what's going on, but they're really just giving you spoilers from the manga.
@ Brad, I'm the same way. Because what you see in the manga may not always be depicted tit for tat in the anime, not always...I myself enjoy the different POV's.

You're so right. I hate manga spoilers. You guys ruin everything. We don't care about what's going to happen, and we don't need you to parrot what you've read. Unless you're asked, shaddup!
The biggest issue comes from those that don't use the spoiler tag. If you read a spoiler comment then you wanted the information. But you have to give people the option to be spoiled first.
Is a tough line I mean manga readers get so caught up on what they read that they can't hold themselves and let everyone know about what's going to happen next
Put your hoods on.. Shit just got real.
