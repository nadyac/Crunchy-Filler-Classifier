Now THAT'S an episode!
That was just AWESOME
After two kirito pictures I just wanted to keep the chain going.
Awesome episode! It's like you can understand why he did what he did & how he was able to do it. It's just like he told madara - Kakashi will be in the new world they create. So he just basically saw himself as purging this old world to
...create a happier one without pain. The friends he killed would be all in that new world. Poor Obito...makes one hate madara even more for taking advantage of Obito's bonds with his friends and the pain he felt. And that ending song..
And that's why I love this show, all the bad guys or at least most of them have a background story and have a legit reason for being who they are!
My goodness, I can't believe what I just watched...........
So it's basically how yahiko ran into nagato's kunai, right?
yup. but there is a deeper reason than that to but you'll need to wait to see exactly why =D..
They kept mentioning experiment, so my guess is that the Hidden Mist forced Rin into something.
Umm They sealed a Bijuu in her So She knew she will go on a rampage so she asked Kakashi to kill her but he refused then she threw her self to Kakashi's Chidori
DanTheMineKidR9: Thanks for using that handy spoiler check box, shit-for-brains. Oh, wait...
That moment Kakashi and Obito Simultaneously awakened their Mangekyou Sharingan had me speechless............ I can't believe what just happened.
it was a level up. I think it was max level from Lv5!
I agree completely. But I don't understand why we never saw Kakashi use it until recently.
Imo they should have made it slow motion, the way the manga did it was perfect. Also Kakashi as a child didn't have the chakra to use a Mangekyou Sharingan.
Also the reason they got it, was becource kakashi killed Rin, like we learned a long time ago, the way to awaken it was to kill your best friend.
What Gseckz said even now Kakashi struggles.
That.... Was.... EPIC!!!!
As a manga reader, I can tell you I was EXTREMELY impressed. There's not often where I enjoy the anime episode much more than the actual chapter. Whoever animated the fight scenes for this episode I tip my hat to you, and my other hat.
the fight animator gets all my fken hat collection!!! this episode had me like O_O
One of the best episodes in a LONG... LOOOONG time. No bullshit, just all story, and great animation.
come on naruto goin full nine tails wasnt amazing? thats what weve been waiting for for 10 years
Naruto going full 9 was amazing, sitbfe.But this...this was...different. Dark, unadulterated...pure in its delivery, and unfettered in its perverse penetrations of flesh and bone. Wow ! Obito...tobi...madara....what ever this thing is...
I thought I was crazy. I was like, were there similar episodes before this I dismissed as b.s filler? Straight up, blown away. Jaw on the floor for a good portion of the episode. Can they keep it up?
Kakashi wrote his name out with the shurikens such skill
ty for telling me wat he wrote i was gonna ask someone if they new, so thanks for that
FOR SURE.
Too bad you wear a fedora...
Holy crap, that was a damn impressive episode. Obito's last line with that back drop was perfect.
Obito's defining moment
dont everyone agree that the ending theme really goes with obito

Just thinking about the opening gets me pumped.
the ed is by far one of the best ive seen in naruto, the moment when rin passes through obito hits me every time ugh the feels

the ending theme gives me tingles and makes me want to cry!
fucking epic. every atom of my body was shaking
Technically, every atom in your body (as well as every atom in general) is always shaking to some degree. That degree varies on several factors including temperature.
lol
Stahp with the knowledge.
Until we reach the ability to make things absolute zero, all atoms will have thermal energy, the random movement of particles. The hotter the temperature, the faster the movement. Physics makes me feel smart
The hotter the temperature, the faster the movement, the wikipedia is on my next tab.
Wow - this episode explains a little bit of how we ended up where we are....


What a powerful episode...
The music, ambiance, lighting, and the angle was absolutely PERFECT when Obito said those final words at the end.

i have to say i liked that fight
Everyone liked that fight.
the Mist people.. hated that fight.
LOL. Best comment on here.
You, sir, have won the internetz.
lol
Holy shit that was epic
I don't blame Obito for how he felt. How do you think Naruto would feel if he saw Sakura get killed before his eyes?
yeah this shows how close naruto and obito are, personality wise. it shows how naruto could have turned out, if he saw sakura get killed by sasuke. so sad =(
Ya except naruto didn't end up killing haku..haku even gave him shit about not following through..
If sakura dies i will throw up my arms and run around in the forest singing DING DONG! THE WICKED WITCH IS DEAD!!!
@stardude692001 No such thing as a "good person". Having someone influencing you to do wrong doesn't excuse the wrong, just helps explain it (and makes them guilty as well). We are all capable of terrible evil. Period.
@Angrybadgerson can i join you? NARUHINA FOR LIFE!!
I Felt the feels in this episode so much and actually cried a bet when the credits came on. man Obitos awesome.
Awesome, and hella scary
a new found level of respect for obito
Really powerful episode, if anything. This series always has amazing backstorys
yea amazing indeed. another amazing flashback was the destruction of konoha by obito/nine tails
This episode was really well made!! I LOVED the whole damn thing
