Whatever those two things were, they most certainly did not look like moles.
Those last few minutes were so epic.
They looked more like mud-puppies. At least the male one did...
Da Mudkip is real
That BooB Crayfish had a big pair of mud puppies....
I'm calling it a frog fish.
Strangely enough, I think that Fairy Tail is one of the only animes that I actually enjoy the fillers of. Except for that Filler Arc with the Jiggle Butt Gang... That was just disturbing. =.='
Isn't Gintama just one big filler?
Yeah Gintama don't have much..cept fillers.
There were some parts of Gintama that were continuous serious stories. The certain arcs that focused on a specific character and whatnot. They did drama and action better than most shows when they put their minds to it.
Indeed. Gintama is special in that it's kinda a jack-of-all-trades. They do EVERYTHING. They can make you laugh hysterically, make serious and epic battles, make you cry uncontrollably and teach you some life lessons. At least for me.
How can we sit here talking abou filler naime and not mention Detective Conan?
This episode confirms that Mavis is the most dangerous loli this season
Lol it's not surprising that they know each other very well. They most likely fought against each other, considering that Zeref knows who Fairy Tail are and keeps an eye on members such as Natsu.
uhm, except that Mavis was born in 673 and Zeref was born before 384. the reason they seem to vaguely know each other is because if you remember from the Tenroujima arc, Zeref seemed to be staying on the island. which is where Mavis resides
^I think its more than just that. Zeref has been alive this whole time so he and Mavis could have known each other during her life span, which would give some reason as to him staying on Tenroujima and how familiar they just
Has anyone read Fairy Tail Zero? Cuz I think that might have more info about how Mavis and Zeref know each other...
Just for ur info, Mavis x Zeref=ZerVis
*look at Preview* Erza in a cat suit....HOLY SHIT.
Man that's confusing haha
Oh, who cares. It may be a cat suit or it may be a frog suit, maybe it's catfrog\frogcat(?) suit. As long as it was sexy, I don't care what you call it. :-)
Erza mo sou omou!
Big boobs do have that affect
My heart skipped a beat when I saw her.
Representing Fairy Tail Mavis is Badass!
Natsu officially became the king he has the accessories to prove it (crown)
I can't but I can believe that he took that & thought nothing of it but its probably pretty hectic back at the castle if they're searching for it
Ah wait no.. this isn't what he had to show everybody. OH THE TROPHY! (but you took the crown?!)
is from the side story of the manga jajaja I just want to see the punishment game and and Grays Ice Road
Next episode is filler, it appears.
Jaws, Fairy Tale Edition
I was going to say "Why the hell did nobody comment on the Jaws quote?". At least we have one sharp eye out there.
Fairy Tail fridays

But old in jokes between friends are what makes things...friendly?
I wonder how many more times Fairy Tail headquarters will get destroyed and rebuilt.
I thought the mayor was going to show them a bill of all the repairs they couldn't pay for.
Well, he returned the building they probably used as collateral or couldn't afford to maintain, so that's still quite something.
They won 30Mil from the games
"I can't hear your voice or see your form." *Proceeds to have a conversation with Mavis answering all her questions....am I the only one that noticed this? lol
He's just THAT amazing, haha.
yeah i was curious about that too
They probably have a connection on other level, so words aren't exactly necessary. Idk

Indeed, boobies are always the best bait... Aye sir!
Lucy went all "Indiana Jones" on us! LOL
So filler arc before we start the pre tarturus, also know as WE REMEMBER GRAY FULLBUSTER
We get Filler arc well side storys from the other manga of Hiro Mashima then we get the Sun Village Arc them with get Tartarus
More like we remember Gray Fullbuster, Lucy and Wendy are badass, and these "ships" are sailing.
Oh yay! They're gonna do that omake! And lol the ending now, same song but slow pan-up of Lucy's body?!
A Lucy Dakimakura.
That was a well placed Jaws reference Happy had there.
...Is it wrong for me to still ship Mavis x Zeref? Oh well. The ship hasn't sunk yet! (Even though one is dead and the other is immortal and planning to annihilate the human race. xD)
No perfectly fine, cause though mavis is dead she has an invisible physical form, so they can get up to some crazy shit, with her not being able to see thing.
I don't know what I just watched...
Filler and 4 minutes of real manga story lol

yup someone should call mike rowe from discovery channel's dirty jobs
lucy is so hot
Gray's butterfly shirt *__*
