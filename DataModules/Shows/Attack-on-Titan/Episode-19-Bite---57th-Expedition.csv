The truth is ... there is no spoon.

I am 18
The truth is he actually was trying to kill them, but with the spoon and not his titan form. Just like in The Tower of Druaga...FEAR THE SPOON, the mightiest weapon of them all.
That woman scares the crap out of me lucky she dos not want to study me.
18 and proud
A good episode for me, I liked how it built up to the ending. When the music started in those final minutes it was very exciting. I know the pace can be contentious, but AoT knows how to build strong moments, in my opinion anyway.

And so I did. It cost me half of my right leg, but it was worth it to fight for what I believe is right.
^Lotta respect here. I gotta admit, I would probably never join the military. I'm glad there's much more people braver than me. You sir, have earned my respect
i wanted to join the military but not if it wasnt super advanced like super suits
if there is no complimentary super suit i need to focus on getting rich so i can make my own
People who use the term "Weeaboo" are in general fucking moronic fuckwit troll fucks. Fuck off with that shit. I fucking hate that term so much.
I could go a full epsiode with nothing but Hanji having her freakouts!!!

Subverted by Redshirt Army :<
nah, i think that's higher up Rayray- like maybe 114 or something

Eren in titan form was the help!
The REAL heroes of the Survey Corps: the horses! To not get scared shitless and panic from the immense vibrations of a giant that can outrun you and punt you like a football or crush you like an ant takes real courage!

@typezerospec2 it's probably intentional
These horses are obviously made of specialized maneuver equipment. No way any normal horses could gallop at full speed for over an hour and over rough terrain without serious injury.
@lianesrakow they ARE warhorses. The definition of a warhorse is a horse used for war. I think you mean they're not Chargers. That makes sense. Endurance would be more important than full gallop speed. Like Steppe ponies used by Mongols
REMEMBER TITANS ONLY EAT HUMANS
i don't know what was more terrifying having a titan chase you looking at you with those scary eyes or discovering your stream didn't start with subs.
I have always had to refresh because of no subs every time i've led into the ep from the countdown.
To solve the no-subs issue you just have to right click and select your language No need to refresh.
@Bluechokobo My friends and I were freakin' the hell out! Well, not my Japanese friend. She understood what they were saying. ^_^'
I am glad I waited an hour after the countdown so this issue didn't affect me. Wish this issue was fixed for those that have experience it

And here I thought it would be more cool if he needed a spoon to transform
oh god, the Tick
SPPOOOOOONN!
they would call him rusty spoonz
His nickname should be salad fingers
At least he wasn't reaching for a spork. That would have been just plain undignified.
Another great episode. Good character development with Eren and Levi's Group. Can't wait for the next one. They really know where to place the "To be continued..."
That "To be continued" kills me every time man.

He wasn't titan enough for her
And it took Eren a while to get big too.
He must be one helluva masochist of self-inflicted pain gets him going. Oh, and spoons, too.
Grapefruit. spoon?
Squad Levi is fucking badass. Not only are they excellent fighters, but they are proud and disciplined as well as great people overall.


It looked like most squads where given different orders and different intel on Erens location. Makes sense it's a way to see what squad team or member might be a trader. The less Levi squad knows the more he can trust them I guess.

Not to be rude, WasteU, it's traitor, traders are people who trade things, and yeah I agree w/ your comment.

Would've been cool lol

That would have been stupid, wouldn't it?
I'm pretty glad that they're taking it nice and slow explaining things in this show, that means that there's a chance that we'll get more seasons.
The show isn't stretching anything out, they simply re-ordered most of the flashbacks in the 1st third of the show to go chronologically with the other events. This flashback, like the others, are now being shown where they originally were.
judging by the manga and how the show is i think it will take a long time to catch up. though i have already kinda have a theory of what the hell is going on
The real problem here is that it is a monthly manga, meaning about 1-2 episodes a month. It isn't even close atm though so no worries.
There's no way a series this popular won't have a second season! Maybe they will take a big break to let the manga get further ahead, though.
@Killstof, I remember Fate/Zero did something like that, its very likely too happen, I just hope they don't stretch this out TOO long, but that sweet spot to stop an anime is soooo hard to do T^T
Spoons can be so dangerous sometimes....
my mom only lets me handle things sharper then a knife, no spoons for me #nospoon
Hanji does a mean Gendo.
Oh god I hate when the she-titan smiles, It gives me a chill...
^That'll be a pretty big pillow.
The Colossal Titan hug pillow already exists, after all. I don't think it's 60 meters, though.
Oh I hope titan fetish doesn't become the new thing
me too that'd be just a bit too stupid...how could one get off from that anyway? when reality would be that if a titan f'd ya youd be dead. its like getting snoo snooed to death (futurama) XD too...idiotic...cannot compute *dies*
i want that pillow now!
Who else bit themselves watching this ep!!!!
No what's so silly is your comment ^
Yeah ......i bit it..TWICE!!!!!
I didn't even think of it, but I'm going to do it now just because I don't want to be the only one who didn't do it. Peer pressure

I did it, just so I could have the teeth marks. That way, I could look at them and remember this series forever.
No! No don't end there! Attack what are you doing? Attack! Stahp!
It did stop. Careful what you wish for.

OMG Ur right!!
I can't even relate. Who else has short blonde hair and great physical skills? Do we really need to say it?
I don't know...i think it's Eren's mom. Whatever his pops did to him, he probably did to his wife too.
[This comment has been removed]
no it cant be his wife because erens mom wasnt blonde but i know who it is im just not gonna spoil it <3
Eren, make sure to have a pocket full of spoons........ just incase
I waited 7 days for a 5 minute episode =_= NEEED MOORREEE
Yo, it's called character development episodes. This is one of them. I prefer plot episodes myself as well though.
At least stuff actually happened in the flashback, rather than just repeating stuff we've already seen, or some random filler.
In this chapter of the manga they did a flashback in the middle of it to. Im liking how there following the manga word to word.
Mhm. Like menace mentioned, the flashback is pretty much dead on with the chapter in the manga. I am really happy how much they are keeping true to it!
Funk dat this was such a perfect adaptation of the manga. It could not have squeezed more stuff in there without a preview. I guess they need those previews.
