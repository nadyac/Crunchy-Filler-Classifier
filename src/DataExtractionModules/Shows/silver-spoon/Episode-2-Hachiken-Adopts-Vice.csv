that book was likely written by Cesar Millan. It might actually work with Tokiwa as well!
Pft, Tokiwas is no stray dog, he is a wild species XD!!
Just what i wanted to see in this episode. A cute dog and anal cow fisting...
Strange Slice-of-Life anime at its finest!

Now, who needs p*rn when you have that XD!
That thing's HUGE tho. e /// e
WHY did that scene have to come on as I was eating?! ) :
"He's better at Learning than Tokiwa" - cracked me up!
so funny! XD
That scene with Hachiken showing dominance through food, laughed way too much *insert maniacal laughs here*
Man everytime I watch this show I feel good! Nice opening and Ending song too~~
This season opening song is good. The ending song holds no candle to season 1's though
agreed
"... wait why do I look like a ghost?" That principal is awesome.
I cracked up at that, he is too funny!
Still a Virgin? LMFAO my god that got me
Haha! When I thought the vet was gonna put his hand up his anus I screamed.
I don't even like pets, but that dog whimpering noise get's me RIGHT THERE!
Oh my god the puppy!!!! TOO...MUCH...CUTENESS!!!!!
I was thinking along the lines of, don't tell me the dog will eventually have to get put down.
Did not need to see that cow scene, especially with my pasta present...
Rule #89 Don't let your guard down to a dog because they will take your title or even more. Me: Then I pretty much broke that rule big time
I thought Vice-pres was gonna pee on Hachiken there at the very end.
@Orribahoth, I'm lad someone else had that reaction sice Pork Bowl was the main pet for the 1st season... then they ate him. Then again I don't place emotion on food (spent many times at the farm on summers), maybe dog is tasty?

Love this anime a little more every episode ;b
Mikage really knows how to use her words to beat up Hachiken with invisible punches.
I don't think she actually knew she was doing it. She was confused when she was told to stop.
she lied about horses not stepping on people LOL
Mikage's "Teh heh pero" and sticking her tongue out @10:34 cracked me up.

Once again, poor Hachiken, can't help but feel bad for him every ep, Mikage is so subconsciously cruel! Anyways, great ep!!
So that's why they got the dog in the catchy opening!

It's a stray, so it never had an owner to begin with, therefore, no one literally "threw him out."
He threw himself out
@drake3716 I bet he didn't wanna live in this planet anymore...

Kawaii doggie <3<3<3

oh, he seems to have mastered shake
