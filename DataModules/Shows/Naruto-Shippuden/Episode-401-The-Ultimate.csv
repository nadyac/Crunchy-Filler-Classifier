Dayum... I don't even consider this a filler. I've always wanted to see Lee fighting someone like Shira at full power.

@iLikeSatanDaily ...Regardless of what you consider it, it is filler.
All about constipated mode vs saiyan mode.

Next time on Dragon Ball Z...
AND THIS IS...TO GO....EVEN...FURTHER BEYOND!!!!!!!
hahahaha
Same thought here XD And with the teammates watching while Lee and Shira are poewring up, lol. The terrain was perfect too. ...But then again, they try to physically explain the powerups, and there's some strategy. Not very DBZ-esque, lol
No, if this was dragonballz. They would have stood in the air preparing the same attack for about 4 episodes with an expression on their face that looks like they really gotta poo.. And than white zetsu would show and ask how it feels.
Poor Zetsu, only one question in his life and no one will answer him ...
Been watching all the original Naruto episodes...and you should, too! Chunin exams so badass.

Chalk me up on the list of those who think you've made a grave mistake by not watching the original series first.. Naruto's story of when he wasn't a badass is all the better to appreciate when you didn't know his family history and such.
Couldn't agree more! Remember when Sasuke was like "oh shit is Kakashi an Uchiha?" (not a direct quote) lol
@Ethose012 Two words that disprove that: Ninja. Ostrich.
I remember that nonsense. Frickin Troll Ostrich
Go ahead and say it Gaara
Classic cliff hanger right there, we already know the answer, but we're all waiting for him to say it xD
who else thought Gaara was going to grab is left eye and shout "MY EYE, MY EYE!!!!"
I can only imagine what would have happened had he stayed longer. What has been seen cannot be unseen!
"...Heisenberg.."
You're god damn right!
I wonder if Lee can open his gates while drunk....his drunken fist w/ eight gates...hmmm...
That is just too scary to comprehend. The chaos would be glorious though.
Think nuclear explosion in a singularity
Doesnt he do that in the first Narruto Shippu movie.... Hes fighting a rock guy and its like epic sequence of baddassery
Drunken fist w/ eight gates is like skipping right to ssj3 at max power.
Filler is probably going to last a while still. Well at least it's good filler.
What a Dope action sequence! Def agree this filler has been sick! Lee demonstrates that the Secret Jutsu of the Eight Inner Gates grants virtually "light-speed like" speed to its user leading to an unreal spike in Taijutsu energy potential!

Gotta love Yome's face when she was teased about joining Shira at the northern border battalion. I'm happy for Shira. Although he's won't be seen much he already got someone who loves him. :3.
This filler is pretty good, reminds what Naruto use to be like. As cool as the new shit is, it's always serious and almost nothing happens in one episode.
Watching this episode reminded me of the old DBZ super saiyan duels ... ( T-T)
All this is doing is making me miss Neji!
The feels from what Neji said!!! =(
Me too... So sad :....(
I need a guest pass
any episode that stars with lee taking off his weights shall be bad ass!!
lol am i watching DBZ or Naruto?


I usually really hate fillers in anime, and most of the time in this series, but this one's pretty decent for once.

It's weird that I'm going to see Naruto: THE LAST MOVIE next Wednesday and the series is in filler land, but still. I like it enough to bear it. Good show is good and I am HYPED for Hinata. Ye BOY!
Going to the movie this coming Wednesday also. Can't wait! Gotta re-read the manga again before the movie!
I feel like I'm back watching Dragonball Z...

Dragonball deja vu....
Oh look it's Dragon Ball Z: Naruto Style.
