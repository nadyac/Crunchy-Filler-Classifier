LOL. Good one.
[This comment has been removed]
lol that was funy man
Even the robot is like UA
The force is strong with this one...
Only Kirito would bring a sword to a gunfight
Naw, i can name few others who would do that really.
8:00 LOL He couldn't follow what she said XD
I don't think GGO works that way. that photon sword is a primary weapon. He cant have 2 primary weapons can he? better to use a sub weapon in that world. He cant win at every world the same way.
I heard e fids a way to cheat and dual wield
I don't care if it is the weakest weapon in the game. If it has a Light Saber I am using it :p

@akrahun Actually, I seem to remember it being tied to your time spent in VRMMOs, as in the rarity of the character you would get. In Kirito's case, he's been playing games for 2 years+, so there was a very high chance of getting a rare one
I still think he is a girl with flat chest not all girls have boobs some girls have itty bitty boobs.
no, you know if you have boobs. itty bitty is still something. but i really like this episode, its finally becoming something awesome

its been a great series so far, can not wait until tomorrows episodes
A little R2-D2 unit bringing you your newly purchased light saber! :3
@dragon_soul Well Disney is kid friendly that's why those commenters are bemoaning
Yes if you think about it would be a really really really really... how many really's is that? 4 ok.... REALLY Bad thing.
Kingdom Hearts Mickey Goes Virtual intreaging but not as amazing as Sword Art Online MMO could be.
@dragon_soul yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that would be bad.
cstrboy disney control nothing in the decision of what goes into kh games thats square disneys names on it because they are using characters only now in a new deal as long as its within that franchise square has all legal rights to them
leave it to kirito to beat a impossible mini-game in his first try and first time playing the game
Asuna has the fastest strike. Kirito has fastest reaction speed.
If Kirito had done that in a casino in Fallout New Vegas, he would have been banned from the casino already

^indeed yuuki=faster reaction but kirito has way more experience in fighting so 1 on 1 holding nothing back kirito would probably come out on top... btw that story is super sad, i hope they put it in the anime T_T
Yeah I was surprised by that too but u gotta figure. If his stats are the same as they were in ALO & SAO. Then he has the same speed and strength that he did in those games. So beating a mini game that requires speed would be easy for him.
Sinon: "Why are you so overpowered at everything?" Kirito: "Well, I used to play a lot of God games..."
time. & Congratulated BOTH Kirito & Asuna on clearing SAO. The other reason while not directly suggested, But that can be speculated on. is a Alicization spoiler. So i'm not telling unless ask.
connersing the red nosed reindeer act. Yes, If Kirito hadn't hidden his level things might have turned out differently.This is more of a LN explanation. Kirito blamed himself, That it was his arrogance that killed all 5 of the cats,
@CaptLowRez Well Sora and Kirito do have the same voice actor
CheeseWhiteMage Kayaba accepted his defeat. He stood there and took the final hit because Kirito had spent 2 years fighting the rules of the game he created. At the end, Kirito even overcame the rule of dying when your life reaches 0.
It is worth noting from the light novels that post-SAO games do not allow people to play as the opposite sex. Therefore, if they see a female character they can be sure a female is playing her.

he's purposely doing that to his voice in order to sound more feminine I think. Or it could just be a feature of that skin. Either way it's clear that it's male and he's pretending to be female.
The voice was on purpose. I seems like half the people watching this episode aren't even reading the subtitles. In typical MMOs, M stands for Male, F for Female. Kirito checks himself, and the guy confirms that there are two types, M and F.
"It's a Trap!!!"
What that would suck. I play female avatars more then male one. I most harem anime the male MC is a girly man.

There are girls with itty bitty titties, but down there hmm that's a different story
Well, In the LN Sinon never verbally acknowledged Kirito as a girl. Altho Kirito soon understands that Sinon has mistaken him for a girl. He never states his gender to "leave this misunderstanding as it is" So it's never ask never told.
At the very least mistaken as a girl, Kirito won't be breaking *another* girls heart.
It was hilarious watching him deal with all the cat calls! And even when he's trying to pretend to be a girl with Sinon, all of his manliness keeps bursting out. LOL
Also, he refers to himself as 'ore'. Wouldn't that be odd for a girl to say?
O yea the reason im so good is because im the one who beat SAO. Did i forget to tell you that? sorry.
it got a 0/100 Metascore, 1/5 stars for customer satisfaction and a 39% mortality rate XD
@ahatestory easily he uses a girly name lol
@ahatestory Most likely there are tons of people who name their characters after Kirito, considering he's legendary at this point. Nobody's going to think it's really him.
Not many people outside of SAO know who finished the game, it was all explained in the novels. Because of that he can keep on using his name, plus he just transferred his character from ALO - where his name was Kirito.
10/10 for immersion
It's going to be tough being Kirito's opponent in Gun Gale Online. Why? Because there's always going to be a Trap.
ill give your pun a 6/10
Kirito's reaction when he saw his new avatar was priceless.
At least he didn't grab his crotch and say, "Thank god it's still there!"
I was laughing most of the episode, This one was especially funny to see animated.
@Ozak, nice icon!

Priceless? Nah I'd say 5 mega credits
Wow, over already. That was a very fast 23 minutes. Really enjoying this season.
You're going to feel that way untill the end of the year with this anime (atleast 24 episodes). I'm probably going to feel it twice in Fall 2014; with SAO and Log Horizon. And I said this in Ep. 3; I like both, so let's not go there, guys.
This season is so far very good, and I mean very good.. very relatable now that we have a past to look back to for Kirito. It feels like I really know Kirito while the rest of the GGo players don't, like we're old pals.
Ofcourse the gun toting cowboy would speak english
.made me remember the "pull-string" comments from woody in "Toy Story" .. "Reach for the sky!" .. "Someone poisoned the water hole!" and of course "Kirito's packin' a sausage!" FTW .. (pretty sure he would have froze with that one..)
lol I didn't even notice that, I get so used to just reading the subtitles and having voices be background noise
i was surprised by how fluent the English was. They must of hired an English VA and had him read a line.
I'll kill you. You loser. Die. Go to hell. No! Hey chicken, come on.
the reason behind this is because ggo was made in america
The english of that untouchable booth was funny (and actual english).
Not really but if you think "paied" is english then i say why not... XD
Yeah the only thing that bugged me was the million times the animation said "Paied"... C'mon, spell-check the drawings, why don'tcha?
Lol Ive seen worse misspellings. In Moretsu Pirates, When they were on the first training cruise, they split off a copy of the computer systems and called it the "Dummy system", but was misspelled "Dammy System". In real big bold letters
Kirito be like get paied.


Light sabre, check. Admiral Akbar, check. R2D2, check. Disney lawsuit, check...
At least it's not as bad as the Renhou Arc in GinTama about ripping-off Star Wars XD!
@Bowen: no one cares about how politically correct you think you are. He isn't even transgender, and most people don't associate traps with transgender. Stop being lazy and go spread your LBGT agenda somewhere that actually has impact.
The r2d2 model looked hilarious
Kirito be like, "Does it come in black?"
drake3716, It's black light. Black light looks purple.
the handle is black, the blade is energy.
Wrong you guys, it's a reference to Mace Windu because even the Japanese love Star Wars
Yeah, it must be a reference to Star Wars... Which I've heard is based off of old Samurai movies, anyway XD.
I mean obviously, there were light saber noises xD
Photon Sword? In our world we call it the one and only LIGHT SABER !
@XerBlade False: http://bgr.com/2014/01/21/candy-crush-saga-tradema
Sinon described it at one point as a "hikari no ken", which translated to English would be something like "sword of light". That's probably as close as you can get to "lightsaber" with native Japanese.
Is a lightsaber but to avoid copyright they decided to call it photon sword
Am i the only one busting a gut laughing at this series of comments?
photons are the single ingredient for light so they are the same thing and saber means sword photon sword and lightsaber is in every aspect except for spelling
Liked the fact he checked for breast before he check for the lower half first. I would think most male it would be the other thing first.
i would check to see if i had breasts then if i didnt (after disappointment ) i would then check my pants
Well I'm kinda fat so I do have breasts, first think I'd check is my horse
He didn't check for his most important gun
he should of checked for his elephant
I can see it. In the moment with the guy asking as if he were a girl he probably asked himself, "Am I a girl?" And checked for the first girly part that came to mind. Were he to come across a mirror and question if he's still a guy...

The above two comments are correct. And to add on: Gas motorcycles have become more and more rare in the real world as gas prices have risen and the world has moved on to newer things. I think.
all of the above and another add on from what i understand from friends, its also cheaper and more convenient to just use public transportation as owning ur own vehicle in japan comes with a lot of other bills besides gas and base price.

But can't I get a flying car????
All the comments above are correct, furthermore in Japan bicycles are fairly common and popular. This love for bikes results in a love for motorcycles as being a faster and more natural form of transportation from bikes. They are badass too
Cant wait to watch kirito go ham on everyone with the beam sword and set a new meta for the game
