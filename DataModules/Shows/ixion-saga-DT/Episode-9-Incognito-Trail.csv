lol i seriously thought KT was a girl
[This comment has been removed]
KT is a girl from what I read. Erec doesn't realize it though.
Could be a trans. Wouldn't put it past them to do something like this.
when she was in bed you could clearly see some parts but with the trans gender thing going on you can never tell
It would make more sense that KT is a girl posing as a boy as in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. The story already has one trap and anymore would just make it an anime about gay men and not simply a running gag about man parts.


That ED part looks like a weird mix of Guns 'n Roses and Village People xD
I like Gustave's secret move: Talk to a girl until you have that chick confused.
And apologize senselessly until you gain enough pity to go out lol
alcohol works better


Those were some weird push-ups....
Pelvic thrust push-ups
They're much harder than regular push ups.
It's called "Wave Push-Ups."
Just who's side is Flora on, any way?! Isn't she the one who summoned Kon to her world?
That Calibre is so over powered, lol wow, awesome

Specially for a Monster Hunter game XD (Or I was the only one to catch the references?)
What kind of push up session is going on at 2:40 :S Its looks more like another kind of practice, if you know what I mean
It's called Hindu push up
Pelvic thrust push-ups

That was a pretty serious curve ball that I was not expecting. I assumed another Ixion was in the midst.
All three conversations told at the bar had great punchlines. The first one had me laughing the most. I can't believe no one has thought to make that joke before.
My body is ready!
Wait what..
hahahahahah this guy ahaha
We finally get an ep for DT's many right-hand men
Definitely one the more underrated series of this season. I really love this show.

leon should have used neo armstrong jet cyclone armstrong cannon


Agreed on the pub talk. This anime is just, crazy.
OMG I love the pub talk. That was hilarious.
so many traps
Oh my lord this episode is a crack up
maiden mode and push up's was the best!
