Nice to know an anime that actually feels right when it ends
This brakes me every time I watch it. hugs in deed.lol
I didn't cry while watching this... I couldn't. It was a happy ending. True, it was as sad as any graduation in life... but it was necessary. I'm glad I watched this, and I'm glad it had such a complete ending.
I think a little part of me just died
Waiting to see whether Otonashi actually disappears in the credits is probably the most tense moment in the entire series.
I thought I could handle it since it was a happy ending, but I agree noi a part of died...
Beautiful <3 This series was amazing! I just wish we could learn the stories of all the members of the Battlefront....
TK's backstory Is really sad, accually... Won't go into details, Let you figure that out yourself.
how'd you find out TK's backstory?
#1 Troll lol. The VN will be out soon we might be able to see it their that is after we get an English patch for it.
soo true!! this anime would of been perfect if it had arcs for all the members
This is one show that could have benefitted from 26 episodes instead of 13. It was great, but it would have been nice to have the characters more fleshed out and to spend some more time on the story arcs and explaining how the world works.
freakin animes making a grown man cry !!! -__-
Im with all these ppl who never cry but this got to me. After this ima need to stock back up on tears. :'t
I cry all the freaking time, I'm a crybaby of a guy... but this made me cry for a good five minutes. I've cried for days before, but I was never that intense...
I am a fighter, as in I actually fight with other people. and this made me cry. Don't be embarrassed be happy that something this amazing exists.
To be honest, I nearly cried. No anime (or really anything at all, in the last few years) has done that for me. So, I feel ya.
I am of the firm belief that Clannad broke my tear ducts. I haven't cried a whole lot since then.

It hit the feels so hard.
Did you notice that when it was just Otonashi and Kanade, they were staring at each other? And wasn't that picture of all the characters that played in the ending there since the beginning? So that means they were hinting at the relationshi
I wanted to see tk's back story so damn bad
@Marcos95 - This was the only ending that had kanade in it
kannade
Watched this in school... Hardest thing I've ever done trying not to show any sadness during class. HARDEST THING EVER.
great narrator no wtry watching clannad after story T-T in class i had to be excused for cry in like a lil b@#$h

I didn't cry, but that's because I almost never do. I did scream my lungs out in sadness tho, which may be even worse...
I didn't cry for this episode, but cried for Otonashi's backstory, and Yui's departure. I was expecting to cry though, if that's any consolation
The ending of this is very reminiscent of Full Moon wo Sagashite after the credits.
Watch past the credits or you'll be disappointed. But anyways this made me cry so much Q__Q the last few episodes were tear fests ugh i even got a super runny nose and couldn't breathe.
Mikuya, what are you doing watching this episode if you're not ON this episode? How could there be a spoiler...You should have watched it first...
KNITE, I'm guessing Mikuya probably wanted to read the comments about how good the episode was before she watched the episode. Sometimes I get excited about what happens next and I want a small hint so I'll check the comments :/
A lot of people do that. Personally, I read comments before and during an episode... a spoiler comment only makes me want to see what happens even more
The ending of this is very reminiscent of Full Moon wo Sagashite after the credits.
I was sick while watching this, my runny nose was worse...

This anime was incredible, i tried shedding manly tears but all that came out was tears of joy and sadness, I will NEVER forget this incredible piece of anime history
forget man tears i cried like a pussy
I've never actually seen pussy cry.... but..... i got the gist man... i got.... the gist .... TT.TT
At the start of the closing ceremony is when I started to cry and I didn't stop until well I haven't yet. It was just so beautiful. I am speechless truly I am. I have watched countless anime and 99.9% I never shed a tear, but this broke me.
This was me during this episode too. After the ceremony started, I cried almost constantly right up to the very end, and I have tears now too. I only thought I knew what sadness was until this day TT_TT
clannad and clannad after story will break you into to tiny pieces
I watched clannad and got the tears. I don't really wanna watch after story.

I'm shedding manly tears, that was just an amazing ending to a great anime. Mixed emotions of sadness and happiness with the way things ended but that final scene just left me with a grin on my face xD So happy I watched this anime!
Same here
I'm not crying, my eyes are just sweating... uncontrollably
Did anyone start sobbing uncontrollably like I did? I'm shaking right now. That was the saddest happiest ending in the world. T_T
Yeah i did and i didnt relaly connect with the story until the end, then i started sobbing and i felt so depressed in the end the story really touched me (not in a pervy way) and i just lost it, by far in my top 3 of all time
Me too actually..
wow, this one ranks up there with clannad on the tear jeker animes
Make sure you include Anohana in that tops list
Now i feel like this is gonna happen to me when i finish school.
Lol yeah Angel Beats! is made by the same people that made Clannad.
You should watch H2O: footprints in the sand. that was such a beautiful show.

The only complaint i have is it should have been longer it seed a little rushed at the end every one didint get the ending they deserved it was just the favorites
You're Comment seems rushed.
Damn, these invisible ninjas won't stop cutting onions in my room!
I hope they make a season 2 For The real world there in now i mean everyone is heart broken Cause the Series ended now So Please make a season 2
The despair he showed at the end really got to me. How he grasped her then tried to grab her desperately even though she was gone.
My crying intensified tenfold with that part. I know those feels.
This was the first anime that made me cry! Man! Screw man tears! Those were real tears that were shed today! I need to buy the DVD or Blu-Ray. Because this was anime history made!
I'm with ya'... gonna buy me Blu-ray!
I fell out of my chair I cried so much!
