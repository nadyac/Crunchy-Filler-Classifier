Kirito was so into to kicking ass, he forgot to take names...
[This comment has been removed]
yeah always take names
I always thought it was chewing bubblegum but being all out of bubble gum. XD
LOL That was a good one, Briaria! LOL
You mean like "Beater"? And Cheater? XD
The Yui App, now available on itunes and Google Play.
Ene v Yui v Cortana. Show down of the AI.
^The year of the AI.
For some reason Siri gets activated when Kirito and Sterben are talking between 19:55-20:01. No idea how Siri mistook "Hey Siri" from that.
A Yui app ? Shut up and take my money !
reggie just liking that comment because it was posted on my birthday xD

I call hacks
the players are paying to keep the servers running, they pay 3000 yen (27.50$) a month to play GGO.

DLC ! lol
P2W sucks ass.
I'll pay god damn good money for Yui on my smartphone.
No love for Clippy?
I would pay so much to have Ene on my phone.
I want a Chopper or Happy App
They've got cortana now. It's just not the same :/
Couldn't Yui just hack into the system and trace DG's connection?
Yui is a portable smartphone app that can access any VRMMO apparently.
@trueglich maybe when say oculus rift takes off
but if she is able to hack the cameras and tv at the hospital that means she is a legit program that evolved into an AI, who is not bounded to the same game/seed she was created for. she can surf the world wide web .... even hentai.
EVEN HENTAI! NOOOO
I thought maybe she would try to hack into Death Gun, guess not.
Access any VRMMO and hack into hospital wall monitors.... Yui is hacking software, too...
Well, so much for this arc being 13 episodes long. But given that A-1 wants to be more accurate to the Light Novels, I don't blame them for putting the details from the Light Novels into the anime. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Yea, its one reason why some friends of mine don't bother with simulcasts. They got sick of the cliffhanger thing at the end of every episode that they just watch completed anime now.
That's what I'm going to do galenwolf. Anime's like Akame ga Kill at least are reasonable in this regard, so I'm going to keep up on that.
This cave got more screen time and lines than Klein....
Next episode Phantom Bullet? They end it in the middle of an epic fight so they just give the next episode the same name.
1.Phantom Bullet 2.Phantom Ballet?
This week's ep *and* next week's both have the same name because the titles are written differently in japanese. Last week's preview was read as "Maboroshi no Juudan" and this week's was "Phantamu Bulleto".
Yeah it was a little weird at first but it makes complete sense since it'll be a continuation of today's episode. I like the Irregular at Magic naming system since it actually lets you know the arcs that is covering!
Maybe they meant ''ballet'' as in dancing. Perhaps next episode will be an interpretative dance.
Nope. You'll all understand the meaning of the "Phantom Bullet" in the next episode! ^_^
Does anyone else notice Death Gun has the same sword skills as Asuna in SAO?
Asuna is Death Gun confirmed.
I think we can all agree here that Death Gun > Sugou.
You're mistaken. Death Gun is Godffrey; an innocent soul who died at the hands of a cold-blooded killer for a coincidence. Godffrey, whose name wasn't even mentioned after his death nor was he mourned. He is the real avenger.
No, they have different skill sets entirely. The rapier Asuna used also had slashing skills and the sword style Death Gun uses has no slashing skills at all, they share some but not all skills. Kirito's style also had some stabbing skills.
death gun is shrek in disguise
Anyone notice Death Gun's change in voice pitch? I guess there's no point in acting as a Grim Reaper in front of Kirito anymore.
So... why aren't the remaining LC members in jail? O.o
It doesn't make things much better, but apparently all the red players from SAO had to go through counseling sessions, and were kept separate from those who got to go to the "SAO victim School".
Most LC members were delusional and thought they were just playing the game. Besides, how would you have a fair trial based on events nobody has any records of?
Remember the episode in the 1st season with Kirito and Silica? Rosalia had the rational that they didn't have any proof that killing people in game really killed them IRL. So the government probably treated it similarly
pleading insanity
Well for starters, not all records were lost. Yui could have easily served as a competent plot device for officially identifying mentally disturbed murderers. It was her original job that she was forced to watch, after all. But plot..
Kirito shouldn't be trying to atone for the garbage he killed. He needs to atone for the people he let die because he didn't take out the rest of the garbage! C'mon Kirito, get your head on straight!
If culture were the only explanation, then LC couldn't be a thing. This is the same culture that brings us stories like Battle Royale. It's not that's he's Japanese that he feels the way he does, it's because he's Kirito. It's personal.
I think it's because he's human. I also would feel guilty about killing. I don't think taking a live is righful under ANY circumstances, but I sure as hell would take the lives of pseudo-human garbage who lost their humanity if needed.
killing is killing i agree he should have but killing is traumatic and can consume thats why a lot of sao players refused to kill other players even red and orange players.
I believe taking a life is justified if it is the minimal force realistically/practically possible in a defensive situation. The guilt would be in not being careful, aware, skilled or powerful enough to have avoided the situation.
@kinga750 no it's not. In (some parts of) America it's acceptable to kill someone invading your property, and definitely even the slightest hint of self defense. In most Christian places it's also not acceptable to kill yourself.
Death Gun: "Oh yeah, after you shoot my gun, it also magically turns itself into a cool-looking sword"

Pretty sure he pulled it from some sort of Bayonet storage under the barrel of his sniper rifle.
Deathgun's next power: ZA WARUDO
Seriously, Death gun is way too OP. First the invisibility clock, then having the top assassin sniper and now pulling out a sword called Esloc from his sniper.
wait until mother's rosario, then you'll see op
Estoc, and it's not a legendary weapon or anything. Estoc is the name of a rapier-like sword that has a cutting edge as well as a stabbing point.
Most of his equipment, his "Camo Cloak" and his "Silent Assassin" sniper rifle, were probably bought using real life funds. His sword skills however... What else was there to do in SAO's prison.... Besides to practice his swordplay?
Actually an estoc has a point but no edge, since it had more than two sides you couldn't sharpen it
I'm waiting for both of them to dual wield, gun and sword. Kirito has the edge there. But if the black gun doesn't cause his real death/disconnect then the legend is debunked.
Please tell me that Asuna's gonna wind up saving the day...I'd hate to think she'll spend the entire story as "the girlfriend".
I like the story but hate that there is no action for a game called GGO its kind of lame.
Once I remember your old name, it's over. You don't know my old name, you refused to let me tell you it. Well, sh!t.
Usually its the villain revealing their plan at the end, not the protagonist. Unless maybe this arc is supposed by be structured more like a mystery, but if that's the case there's a serious lack of sleuthing going on. Kirito ya done goofed
Death Gun was pretty interesting this episode. He's very skilled and he gave more insight on his philosophy, he's definitely a wicked man. And the scene with him talking about Kirito forgetting his name was pretty cool I thought.
I said this before, Death Gun way better than Fairy King Oberon.
I agree with that. Sugou was a pretty crappy villain, Death Gun is way more interesting.
"You'll never know my name because... you never asked! MUAHAHAHA!!!" *GASP!*
lol
But.. but.. my lady knows yer name, so poo on you!
These. Damn. Cliff hangers!

at least they got out of the gd cave
I know right! they were in that dumb cave for what? 3-4 episodes!?!
A-1 Pictures adapted this anime as close to the Light Novels as possible. What happened in that cave is one of the most important parts of the arc. Even in the Light Novels, they were there for a while. Trust me, I've read them.
This episode was very... interesting. I'm still suspicious of that nurse though.
Yeah, I half expected Asuna to discover that the nurse was working with Death Gun. Maybe later perhaps, but it seems a tad predictable.

If it seems too obvious, maybe it isn't...
