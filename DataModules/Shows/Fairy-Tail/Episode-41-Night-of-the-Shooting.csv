good point, this is not something Mashima came up. I was a bit confused at since it seemed to flow from on story to the next but looked it up a couple episodes in since it was... lets just say weird
lol
as a man i love fan-service, i'm sorry =/
It is a filler XD So that the manga could pull ahead once again. Though at least it's not another 2 year hiatus orz
@Blzmaruto We don't speak of such things here. They are taboo.
The Ocarina of Time!
You played the song of HOLY SHIT!
The long forgotten super magic: DEUS EX MACHINA!

Think so
Aye sir!
and now we have to wait a week to see the result
Would you call that a three way?
Eh, boobs!
And it had to end there....Fairy Cliffhanger
so true
ace of cliffhangers is worse
So where did black fire dragon come from
@stormking1: I think it's from him eating eclipse Leo's darkness magic earlier.
find out on the next episode of dragon.... >.>
Please make this arc end already. I love Fairy Tail, but this arc is the worst arc ever.
is it filler?
Ya it is, concept at the start was good but then it just flopped. i had so much high hopes when i saw the eclipse celestial spirits too Q~Q though some of them need to keep their designs

The Dues Ex Machina is strong in this one...
Just break everything, it'll all work out somehow. Love that guild.


I don't think Juvia gets enough credit for how freakin strong she really is.
I agree. The Tenrou Island Arc was a good example of her strength there, and she's gotten a lot more power at that.
This arc is very convoluted. People suddenly know integral plot points that they didn't know before. Something happens that is in total conflict with something else that has actually happened. Sloppy.
I really missed seeing Natsu go into different dragon slayer modes like thunder fire dragon and black fire dragon, Fairy Tail Friday ladies and gentlemen <3
The only way celestial spirit wizards can fight without their golden spirits is synchronized docking.
this had everything I expect from fairy tail- random destruction, intense battles, a corny inspirational scene, sacrifice.... so why do I feel so... unsatisfied? It was good, but it just doesnt feel like fairy tail
maybe cause it's not written by the mangaka? Def not in the manga for sure.
This entire season so far has left me unsatisfied for some reason as well... I don't understand why though.
it's a horribly done filler arc that's probably why
K8XM6RKXSFN 84JXBG493GR Here we go, enjoy!
Just as we get to the good part: End of this week's show.
natsu's clothes are all intact regardless of all those flash beams. but if it is a girl.....
SO INTENSE OMG CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE.
