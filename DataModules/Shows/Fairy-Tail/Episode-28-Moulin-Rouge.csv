Poke me with your stick next.LOL!!!
Juvia-Bot 2.0. She's a Cylon O,O
Juvia 2.0 is best Juvia
but the new start forward gray is great too
straight
Your Balls Lack Spirit
Let's be honest, I think we all knew that Juvia wanted Gray to poke her with his cue stick. That line killed me.
And Gray said "No way." ~facepalm~ I need to have a one on one talk with him.
Im cracking up
ya i lost it... I was thinking "cue" stick all right lol
After all this buildup if it finally happens the world is going to shake.
the position of that goose do
is this cannon? if not that was an awesome filler and we get to know back story of bisca !
yeah i remember this vaguely from the manga too
Nothing about this episode was filler
this was a sidestory featured in the manga, i read it and i had no idea Moulin was Bisca lol
That's what I liked the most about the episode, the back story of Bisca formerly known as Moulin Rouge
whao Bisca has really changed to thing she has a kid now
Bisca forgot the first rule of anime fights; don't bring a gun to a swordfight
or practically anything else
Hmmmm what type of sword was that I wonder
what about a gunblade?
kirito brought a sword to a gunfight and he did alright

Then Lyon walks and says, "Ohh Juvia I'll poke you with mine." lol
I only want to get poked by a long cue stick, not your short one Lyon
Ice make - phallus!
ooohhh no its too cold I want gray samas
Ice Make: Hachi Shokushu


How could you say no to poking her with your cue stick?!
Priceless.
LMFAO! Her comment was unexpected yet expected as this is Fairy Tail.
I love Erza's horrible fashion sense. She has every outfit in the world. Every terrible outfit. "Here, wear this swan penis head dress."
if u watched the ova natsu gave her that but shes never worn it. she offered it to lucy.
LoL I laugh how the waitress said " I wish she gave me the bunny outfit better"
It's rare! one of a kind! lol
NEVER piss off Erza, Or falsely claim to be a fairy tail member.
I now have the urge to play baseball with billiard balls and a cue stick while shouting out golf terms
Even Lucy was there back then, huh? Small world
Only Erza would hit someone after apologizing and then say something beautiful
So, you like to strip before you play pool, huh? I like to live life dangerously, too.
Did happy sound like pikachu to anyone else at like 20 seconds in? "Pika Pika!"
Omg yes I was like wtf
strip billiards, thanks gray I learned a new game to play today xD
I think we all did
Yep shoot bullets at the other player while he deflects them at a ball with a sword
It would be funny if Erza wore a swimsuit playing pool
She almost was.
sword, pool, desert connoisseur, armor expert Erza Scarlet !!!!!!!!!
Why is it whenever you are gonna watch a show that you waited a week for, your internet decides to slow down on you... To the point where the video lags due to slow rendering.
I still can't believe the swan dress returned....
