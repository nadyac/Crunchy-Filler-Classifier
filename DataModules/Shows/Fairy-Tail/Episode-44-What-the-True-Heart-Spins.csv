Soooo clooooose~~!!!!
I actually watched this for the cuteness alone!
Lmao EndlessEnigma never expected to see the fifth used in the comments, in this case the fifth didn't do much but tell us your true answer, which is mine too;)
Its not the end of the world.. lets do it!!!! XD
I didn't
For those who are not aware, this episode is canon.
i thought Lucy liked Natsu ...
'Course she does! Lucy just isn't quite ready to realize it herself. :3
I thoguth Natsu and Lisanna was together
^^^^ please tell me you dont ship NaLa @SPYMAN1237
@shurtis I know right! NaLi and NaLa is not a very good ship... I mean look at Natsu's face when he's with Lucy... Then look at his face when he's with Lisanna.
Am I the only one who wonders how that snow globe survived that drop?
@trimateric In their mind: Just like taking a candy from a baby
It could be the FT's worlds version of acrylic. When we sold acrylic globes where I work I would enjoy dropping it mid conversion & watching the customers reaction only to have the globe bounce off the concrete & back into my hands.
Well it looks like it is made from some magical materials. So it must be like an unbreakable snow globe.
@Matt784 Can I have one
Lacrama must be pretty darn tough! I think that's what they said it was...
Of course, whenever someone utters the word cake Erza gets involved immediately. Shame she didn't get to have some.
Comments that talk about what happened in the corresponding episode are not real spoilers, as no one should even be reading the comments before watching the episode.
people do read them before watching, so you can't justify it not being a spoiler by that statement.
Khaosknightzero is right, the comments are for people to comment on this episode its not a spoiler. If you don't want to spoil the episode DON'T READ BEFORE WATCHING. That simple
Erza carrying Lily was so cute! Never imagined we would see them team up
Cute, funny, and the feels. Also, Nalu. glad this was adapted from the manga. And poor Erza.
I like how she just casually picks up Panther Lily
I want to be Lily!
Never not Lily.
ASUKA IS SO KAWAIII!!! I love her for the Nalu too!
Damn it Happy! Why did you let yourself get caught so easily by Lucy? xD
That to me surprise me. I wonder why Lucy was embarrassed to kiss Natsu
Asuka doesn't know shit about gun safety
I want to eat some strawberry Erza for dessert

Or used one of Happy's old "He lllllllllllikes you!" =P
@Iskandos that would of been messed up
OMG Natsu is going to actually kiss Lucy... (After Scene) WHAT the Hell... Natsu how many years have you and Lucy been together, get that shit over with already, I mean you already seen her naked you even grabbed her boobs a kiss is nothing
Those feels, the perfect episode after all that fighting. Haha, imagine how Lucy and Natsu's kid is going to turn out like.
No doubt their kid would act like Natsu.
Natsu, have you forgotten all about Lisanna? Oh well.
Yeah @Resident_Gundam I agree.
@Resident_Gundam - Lisanna's return was not part of the original plan for Fairy Tail. The plot was designed with her being dead throughout. This was changed, or so I've read, because a friend of the manga author begged him to bring her back
*continues* The plot, however, had no role for her. So, occasionally, she's given token roles of little importance and the once-in-a-while line to speak. Granted, this is all what I've read on the subject. Who knows if it's true.
So glad they animated this even though it was only a one chapter story.

How would a move like that be R unless we are talking horror involved.
Nah! It's adult.... <3
the R could be for violence and language. You have both Natsu and Erza involved.
Rated R for racy Lucy fanservice!
Aww, loved this episode! I love these episodes there is kinda out from the storyline, like this. It shows more of the every day life they live. ^^
Just remember people, this is actually canon.
14:00 Dangit soooo closeeee =(
Natsu Dragneel: The Dragon Horse
CANON!!!!! FINALLY!
