First, there was the Luigi Death Stare, but now, there's the new Yona Death Stare! Guaranteed chance that Yona wants to kill you! But Wait there's more! She knows How to Train Her Dragons.
LMAO!! Thank you for that laugh Garuda475..... Think Yona can compete against Hiccup?
lol yea HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON man it cracks me up!!!
It's haki :3
The only way that death stare could've been better: have it interrupt his sentence, and have him gasp or squeak or fall over or something. This is an epic "I am not amused" expression.
ah, he did gasp... but did not fall over.
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK FOR THIS
AWWWW ! WTH! SON OF $#%%^&^$#@!&*())___+(*&%$#@$%^^^&**%^$#%^&*%$# DAM! NOW I have to one more long long long week to see the great beat down (>^<) !
@sparrow420 ... your picture makes that so much better
So many cliff hangers the past few episodes! You guys are killing me!

I WENT CRAZY AND GOT ALL EXCITED I ALMOST BROKE MY COMPUTER OUT OF EXCITEMENT!!!
WTF WHY DID IT END THERE NOOOOOOOOO NOOOO NOOOOOO NOT ANOTHER WEEK PLEASE SPARE ME KAMISAMA
EYES ON FLEEK!!!!!!!!!!! love the im going to kill you death stare
I'm really sad that it ended there, I DON'T LIKE IT! Waited a whole week to see what happened, then, nope, another cliffhanger. Blasted them.
At least it'll only be 3 more episodes with cliffhangers?... Bad news is, though, that we'll only have three more episodes left... WE DEMAND A SEASON TWO!!!
The last dragon isnt there yet, of course there will be another season at least :'D

Wtf lol... This is the first time out of any anime, that the look of an animated character made my heart race. I hope I wasn't the only one who felt something by Yona's death stare. I love the art style.


It's totally great that you guys don't like her. But don't spoil it for us, it's obvious she's becoming much stronger and it's something called character development. Give it a few more episodes.
Its good, but still can't compare with naruto during the Haku fight (when it went black and white, very stylized art form to express him enraging). This is light intimidation. Naruto was zerker mode
To see Lelouch or some other already badass character do the death glare is normal. But if it's done by an innocent character...well, that's different. Just saying.
AKATSUKI NO CLIFFHANGER
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo TwT Now i have to wait another week OTL
Stark you rock!

I have deep respect for Yona right now. I remember when I broke my ankle, and there was no way I would have been able to walk on that thing.
Yeah, and even twisting it put me on crutches for a month. Not fun to walk on that. Yona is definitely determined NOT to be the damsel in distress character and it's working. Also, Sinha is amazing.
Yona's got some demon eyes when she gets pissed.
Sprains are painful but I've played a game of netball on a sprained ankle and carried on a volleyball game with a freshly broken finger so it's doable if you have the capacity to isolate the pain, it just takes a lot and comes back worse
Those eyes! THOSE BURNING EYES!
Yes, in the manga her eyes already looked really badass, but anime just took it to a whole new level!
Agreed!
Ah, I didn't mean to remove my comment. "Right!? In the manga her eyes were threatening. Here they're threatening, burning, and awesome!" or something like that. *laughs*
I approve.
I didn't really find her eyes all that impressive. I mean, it's not that the art work was bad or anything, it's just it seemed unrealistic, and I find it a bit annoying that She can escape danger just by looking at people.
Yona's fierce eyes is both deadly and sexy.
Wonder if you could do that with contacts? Way cool but probably not since it be right over the pupil? Darn!!!
It seems possible. Something like red-eye from a flash, just a reflective layer that would pick up light easier, and require less light.
i love this please make more and a 2 sesson please
Advertisements in medical institutions say yes, but I'm not really sure..
Until we get holographic contacts I don't think they'd look as blazing and fiery.
That was an amusing fight! So much different than I remember it being in the manga. *laughs* Ah, now there is only 3 episodes left, right? Hopefully this will get a 2nd season!
I agree. I want to see the sword dance animated; and no way thats going to be done in two episodes.
It's a top-notch show, well deserving of a 2nd season but that counts for little I'm afraid.
@Nyanako- Maybe if the anime gods give a second season...That sword dance was all at once gorgeous, badass, and heartbreaking in what it represented...A great bit of storytelling and art at the same time. It deserves to be animated.

That death glare from yona.....PRICELESS!!!!!!!!!
this one lol

Even without Yona there the bromance is strong! It appears the "shipping everyone with everyone else" strategy is the only feasible option after all.
That's what I've been saying this whole time. ^_^
Yup. That is pretty much my principle for this anime. lol XD
Yona is one of the best female protagonists I could have ever asked for. She is the queen~
ALL THE DRAGONS ARE SO PRECIOUS
been waiting all week for this this episode felt like it went really quick and now to wait for next week lol
Everything else is a filler in life until next Tuesday *-*
Yona's eyes are freakin' gorgeous!!! FIREBALLS!!!
I love this anime with a passion!
Beware the eyes! I hope this gets a 2nd season please! F8KPLZSSYGE
