I lied to my self saying that after the last 4 episodes id get some sleep
i know those feels bro
What is this sleep u speak of cus i be like one more episode and then i end up finishing the series
sleep? HAH! I've worked my way from one piece episode 300 to 600 in a month. We don't do sleep you see. We are the chosen people. We are the Otaku, and I mean that in both the literal sense and the way Americans use it.

Why is this show sooo awesome? If Blue exorcist gets any better I think my head might blow up.
gosh! i feel your pain TT^TT

@nature_alchemist are you talking about the crappy original series or brotherhood that actually follows the manga?
@Thornsgroupissac probably the crappy original
.....what happened to Nee??? Whens he gonna come back??......D': Neee-chaaann!!
me too D': NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Am i the only one that loves to read what you guys comment after every episode ? I mean i feel like i have this mysterious anime family here
agreed
OK IM GLAD YOU SAID THIS i have this routine that when the closing song is playing i go through as many comments as i can. I'm smart ik
.......i thought i was alone in this!!! and midnightpanda, i do too!
I just go through the comments during commercials-including spoilers. Who cares if I know what's gonna happen??? it's anime!
The CR comments are top notch. There are some witty mofos out there.
Ryuji surprised me, of all the people there I was expecting him to be the last one helping Rin, deep down they're the best of friends
Agreed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Like hel he is! X3
It's kind of weird that not any of them really had a problem with it
He is so much more accepting of Rin in this than in the manga
If Satan and demons in this show exist, why aren't God and angels helping?
I think some of the posters here missed the point of the question, which is; In the context of this anime only, why do demons run amok commonly on earth, or even fill benevolent roles such as temple spirits like Kuro, and angels do not?
It's the choice of humans to experience demons.Humans allow them into their reality, and Angels will not interfere with a struggle they created for themselves. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger anyway. Both are real btw, I've seen em
And, your right Mattferris. God helps those who help themselves. Angels don't step in and save the day, but they will offer tools for the battle through intermediaries like these exorcists and whatnot. Everyone must win their own battle.
Answer to the problem if u want the angel part then watch a certian magical index 1 and 2
Angel does exist. Hello, he's the Paladin
lol.....Mephisto is such a salesman....
If it were the real Vatican they would have executed him without a trial.
Wasnt his fault he was born that way. I mean, its obvious he can change his ways so why kill him? (I hate that kinda stuff. my moms bro was shot in the side of the head and his killer was found innocent because he said it was an accident)
^Have you ever taken World History
Every time I watch an anime with a cliffhanger like this one really late at night like I am now....FK YOU ANIME! I LOVE YOU AND HATE YOU!
agreed
WHY DOES THE SIDE DESCRIPTION ALWAYS HAVE SPOILERS x_x
LOL that's kinda why I look at them XD

i wanna see the ventriloquist's powers! he looks so lame and helpless thus meaning he is awesomesauce...can't wait!
But that logic is totally the opposite in real life .-. sucks me then...
I like to feel awesome by exercising a lot, wearing clothes that make me look cuddly, and acting cuddly.
Day 1 Im already on ep 16 dam its 6:34 i need to get off
hah me too
I think this anime deserves around 50 episodes maybe 70 to finish the story fully explained, but we seriously don't need anymore 400+ episode animes -.-'
No more Naruto and Bleach like (well bleach had CLOSE to 400) shows. Not dissing them. Just saying they're long.
i started watching One Piece but had to take a break tbh
Sleep! D: I need it :c But this anime! D: I need it too :c
It's the Democrats and Republicans all over again...
I'm so excited to see this episode! Huge Fan of Blue Exorcist!
The past couple of episodes have kicked some serious ass.
OH boy this show is getting better i cant take my eyes off this damn computer
love rin's face in this one....... need a pic printed out so i can hang it on my lil sister's wall and scare the crap out of her! sry lil sis X)
*goes into depression without her Blue Exocrist* T.T til next week Rin my love
