Let's all throw money at the producers so they will make another season. This show really needs one!
Considering how this episode went, a next season is practically guaranteed. Of course, in some cases, this could be wrong. But I highly doubt that will be for this anime so a second season should come soon.
There has to be another season! You cant have it stop the day after they meet the last Dragon before she achieves anything - besides making everyone insanely jealous & totally misinterpreting Haks feelings!!
there has to be a season 2 seriously if there isn't i will die people

@AoTheChipmunk I think Zeno/Jeno/Xeno (depending if u read the manga along with the anime series or not) is the one to wield the shield, while Hak will wield the sword.
Getting Jeno to join was too easy. Everyone else had their own stories they had to play out, and overcome something. I predict that this cheerful character actually has a tragic backstory.

Uh. Of course they're going to make a second season. Hak needs to just confess his love to Yona and kiss her before I freak out.
Dragon team Quests:(1) infiltrate hidden mist village (2) Navigate hostile cave-dungeon and rescue isolated hostile team member (3) Pirate assasination, infiltration and espionage, path of courage and survive final boss encounter (4) cook
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Time-tested and true.
Yes, cut open and then cut up under the ribs instead of through
It's a long and epic grind to get your cooking skill high enough to attract a dragon.
very true
Unless said Dragon is starving & not very picky!!
Hak, the Dark Dragon... I like it.
I was cheesing when he finally kissed her...in her sleep! Oh, I just wish he'd spit it out and tell her his true feelings!
he already licked honey off her hands.... not sure he can beat that
he could skip a few bases and run a straight home run!
LOL Oikoro so true!!
@jwalton8323 GOOD IDEA! I move we submit that to the producers as a fan demand.
Does anyone want to talk about that forehead kiss though!
It was really sweet. Nice self control because his "urges" could have easily ruined the mood. *lick*
^^ oh god. Cannot un-see O.O
I was cheesing!
Sometimes I hate her for being so innocent. Please, do something Hak, damn it.
Or someone else baht2021.
okay +1 if you want season 2 NOW !!!!!!!
Better to speak with your wallet than through upvotes for a season 2. Sadly, foreign sales are usually not considered as important as local sales in Japan (though that's not always the case).
which is kinda bullcrap
@rabbi2himself that is not true. If you want to support the show, being vocal does not hurt at all.
and i was hoping for a second season announcement at the end but it never came
All most nothing happened, nice flat ending. Leaving it to your imagination.
I like how the yellow dragon joins. Just feed him and he's yours.
It was very similar to adopting a stray dog.
Basically is a stray
'It had even me saying, 'Boil me, take me, do as you please." Can we all confirm Jeaha is some sort of Masochist?
He enjoys Hak punching him as well. ^_^
yep it is pretty much confirmed
When Hak said "As you Wish" at the end I was getting a Princess Bride vibe from it.
Yesssssssss!!!! You weren't the only one!
I was really impressed with how well they did with this anime. It followed the manga really well. I'm going to miss watching this every Tuesday. Here's to hoping for a season 2!
Dragon Awaking: "Boil me, take me, do as you please!" O.O That's some hell of a wake up! LOL
Nah, I think that's just Jae-Ha; you know, being a masochist and all. xD
yeah id rather be woken up like shido from date a live than boiled although id much prefer to wake up like issei from highschool dxd
This show is really beautiful. I'm hoping for season 2.
TAKE MY MONEY!!! MAKE ANOTHER SEASON!!! *throws entire wallet at computer screen*
Ends up spending money on buying a new laptop to replace the one you just broke with your wallet.
yeah
..........the squirrel is eating meat. They're feeding him meat...... Best squirrel ever!
The ground squirrels where we live are quite happy to eat carrion and I've seen them cannibalize other ground squirrels on rare occasions. Protein is protein - eat it when you're lucky enough to get it.
Yep, squirrels are omnivorous.
It also ate fish in a previous episode.
The squirrel is pannivorous. It also eats stone bowls, clothing, earrings, and more. They'll wake up one day and find out it's eaten Soo Won too, with no leftovers.
Ah, it's over . . . for now. I really hope the manga gets picked up for translation soon!
NO!!!!! YONA!!!!! I love you! Don't leave me! I love this show so much! I'm depressed now that it's over. *wails in the emo corner* WHY YOU DO THIS!! *begins chant* SECOND SEASON! SECOND SEASON! SECOND SEASON!
*starts folding a thousand cranes*
seven seasons and a movie
Hak's confession... no, declaration, best sums up this portion of the series. Thanks CR for bringing this one over. Yona's the best!
I love his words and all they express: not just affection for the cute girl Yona is, but admiration, respect, pride for who she's becoming, even thankfulness that he could be there to see her growth. I feel the same as a reader/viewer!
So much pride!! Hak gets worried for Yona, but he never gets in her way.
Loved it! I just wish there was more! ;____;
That episode was done to perfection. What a lovely way to end the season and, hopefully, set up for the next 24. I can't see how they could have done anything better. Plentiferous kudos to the production team, author, and voice actors!!!
omg that end was half assed, they literally are like "heres the yellow dragon!!" and end the show like they forgot about him
Actually, the yellow's sudden appearance is part of the plot. There is a good reason for why he just shows up and joins.
Oh my, that Yona and Hak shoulder to shoulder scene. Wallpaper worthy!
I think you'll find one in the forum thread on page 57.
