Yukio: "HIS SPIRIT PRESSURE!!!!! ITS OVER 9000!!!!!"
best episode ever!Did anyone else's eyes start to hurt after watching that??? that would be the worst injury ever!!!
i love how orihime act a little kid it was funny. but some people act that way when donuts are involved.
got damn its about time she gots a Level Up* she was that freaking pokemon you didnt battle enough and so for the whole game its on Lv13!
Yukio should upgrade to a PS Vita

No he doesn't.

@hollamondw He's replying to the guy above who said "You mean a 3DS"
woo...was worried theres was going to be another episode about kites lol
Kite Tubo would be pissed if he read this.
" i was a cheesey bad man!!"
I know right? So much bad rep from the past arc is finally made up for.
Well that's only because she's acting more rationally. They way she acted in previous arcs was ridiculous. But this time her character makes more sense.
i'm so annoyed it took 350 episodes to actually develop her into a real character - her behaviour in that last arc was so flat and unrealistic it was messed up
DAMN, ORIHIME IS BAD-ASS

I'll believe that Orihime defended herself when pigs fly. * Sees pigs soaring overhead * Okay then. GO ORIHIME!!!!! :3
Inoue done got badass you go girl
LOL. The donuts part was so cute xD and Ginjo, you bastard. How dare you stab out Ichigo's eyes? -.-
ahhhhh i freaking luv bleach epic ending!
good thing i waited...sweet 3 new episodes xD
HOLEY FUCK! O.O
I though Inoue was gonna attack her for that donut lmfao
