its funny how they can call each other morons i miss yui things are getting sad
Iwasawa was better
You're killing it.
I think Yui is funnier and I like Yui-Hinata moments <3
Yui T_T
Yui was so awesome! I miss her badly,,,,,
I love TK's random english.

His death story is that he danced so much in real life he exploded. His only way to find peace and be obliterated is to go on dancing with the stars.
^Seems legit LOL
I kiss you, Dances with Shadows
TK got stepped on by a giant Digimon in his later teenage days where he got really into dancing
I can't believe Hinata and Otonashi actually believe that Kanade was an angel until now
I've just noticed how nobly toilet paper flushes down... in fact, I AM toilet paper.
Did you just disapear and become reincarnated as some sort of water animal?
no we form an army of dongos and thats it, but we call it a family
@hoodedy was that a clannad comments just now
ALL OF US ARE INFERIOR TO TOILET PAPER AND CLOTHES PINS!

Naoi is funny!!!! (the thumb-ups)
Lmao Naoi. XD 'He's a moron' yes he is..

attending high school for an eternity?! yeah that sounds worst than death...
TK is such a badass
Lawl Angel is just walking and killing things XD
i saw that it was beast XD
She was like walk-walk-sliceslicesliceslice-walk-walk-walk.
When I saw ninja girl with her puppies I lost it. I just started crying, in fact I am tearing up right now.
omg i JUST noticed the number of people change by end of the ending theme relevent to the story. that makes it all the more sad T.T
Yui's not there anymore
Sometimes they get called morons at unnecessary times like when naoi takes blame for otonashi, and gives a thumbs up. He wasn't being stupid but only being kind.
I feel like it's a complement by now, seeing how much they say it to each other.
comments on last episode had buzz phrase "manly tears", now it's "interesting" I feel like I'm being fucked with
Hinata`s gone through so much, with his life before, missing the ball the second time and then yui...
Yeah...except the ball thing was just exasperated by youthful angst and blame placed on him, and for Yui he was helping Otonashi. That said, Hinata's life wasn't that tough at all compared to many, many, many, many others.
I think it's supposed to be implied that he really did feel for Yui. I.e. more had gone on between them behind the scenes. I don't think he was lying to her, anyway.
you're toilet paper.
You flush so nobly.
i love how they were fighting over otonashi they were fighting over who has a better bromance with him

Lmao i love the Thumbs up
Also call me Chri-
OK, Chris!
