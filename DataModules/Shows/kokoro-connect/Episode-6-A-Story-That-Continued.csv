i would be scared to death if my deepest desires was unleashed.. i would be arrested at once..
if my desires were unleashed I think I would be arrested for life
... A certain person I know will end up stabbed if that happened to me.....
A lot of bad things would happen to me if my desires were unleashed... Yeah, I don't like the sound of that. I'd probably confess to someone or try and rape him or something bad.... Hm... that would be awk.
For Taichi his deepest desire was the freedom to wear crocks in public. He did not even mind that he lost all the respect others had for him and his footwear
if my deepest desire was released.... well... I'd probably end up with an empty fridge for one thing... maybe something weird would happen beyond that. Like interacting with society.
Inaba... You dirty birdy. :3
Inaba you legends browsing porn whilst talking normally
Exactly what I was thinking. She's a boss.
she was looking at fanfics about her an that game her her insperation
Everything was good until the crocs.

God dammit, heartseed, if you need test subjects to mess with, just call up Aperture Science. They've got plenty to spare.
or maybe umbrella corp.

The Foundation has plenty of D-Class personnel to spare.
and what would he do with a bunch of flippin vegetables?
Clearly the only solution here is a threesome.
Preach it !!! ( Praise da lawd !!! )
Clearly...
this show makes me feel so weary alone, why do i suck so much at making friends...
I'll be your friend.
I'll be your friend *-*
I'll be your friend. See? You made a friend once every year ^-^
Good friends are the ones that make it feel like your not so lonely, even when they're not around. I just thought I'd say something philosophical, sorry.
I'm so performing the "Heartseed Entrance" from now on whenever I walk into a room...

O_O SPOILER!!!!!!!
It felt like episodes 1-5 were a whole season, pretty amazing storytelling I think.
Am I the only one that thinks Inaba and Taichi should be together? IDK,but i really preferr them together
I think they should be together too...

Thanks, asshole.
She's in the "I noticed the guy I like likes someone else, so I'll play matchmaker" role, and I'd like her to come out on top if only because I've never seen it happen before.
Toradora and KimiKiss are a couple of examples of that happening if your interested. I guess School Days kinda counts too.
If this happened in real life, we'd all lock ourselves up in our rooms
Heartseed trolls so hard!
I'm sorry Iori but thumbs up for INaba + Taichi !!!!!!
Please, no School Days ending :c
also, I can't be the only person who's down for Inaba and taichi getting together.
green crocs????????????????
act on emotions and you pay child support or in up in jail....the rules are teasing & pleasing
I think Inaba is in love with Taichi .....can't wait how the story develops
dam i think id rather the body swap deepest desires can lead to very bad things
