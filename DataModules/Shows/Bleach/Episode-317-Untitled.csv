What really bothers me is no matter how many times Ichigo saves Soul Society, they turn on him and treat him like dirt. Way to show your gratitude... Jerk-wads!
No kidding, I mean, did it really not occur to them to just ask him to come with them? It's not like he would have had any reason not to if they hadn't attacked him...
kind like in real when working a job LOL
Blame the writers. It's their crappy plot development.
I miss Neliel!!!! :( :(
don't worry
what do u mean don't worry? is she coming back?
Two Thumbs Up for the new intro...oh yeahh!!
Yea like it but I still like the other one
and ichigo "defeated" that captain...yet they still treat him like hes just that substitute soul reaper who came crashing into the society in a big canon ball...urahara is the only reason aizen was defeated. yet hes still banned...
There's actually an explanation for why he's still banned... I think... It might just be Yamamoto's stubbornness though... But yeah, they really should start respecting Ichigo more!
Urahara played a big part of how aizen was taken down however uraharas kido only was able to activate because ichigo puched aizen to his limit otherwise aizen wouldn't have lost sadly
lol, the dude saves the world, and that's how welcome him.....:P
So Ichigo lives in a hospital but keeps the girl in his bed
Well it's more like a clinic... And hell yeah, wouldn't you keep a cute girl in your bed too?
The animation has gotten so much better in this episode!
EPIC opening!!!
awesome opening
K seriously da fuq happened to Nel?
damn I read the comments and i see hate and love for this arc. In my opinion this is the BEST filler arc out of the whole series.
Bleach = Science guys are creepy, except for Urahara.
Better to have filler arc, than random arc. new captain, zonpacto rebellion, turn back the clock...all not bad in my eyes. You wanna keep up with the story, there is always the manga (OMG, I have to read? Whats that?)
TURN BACK THE PENDULUM WAS CANON!!!!! WHY DOESN'T ANYONE GET THAT?
i thought he lost his soul reper powers
I just started freaking out over the new opening. When I get to the last episode I'm just gonna break down and cry.
Yeah, what did happen to Nel? She just kinda disappeared off the face of the... worlds? o.o
@applonee exactly thats just really stupid about bleach I mean look how naruto is a hero and ichigo is treated the same way as he was before why isn't he a hero?
What the hell was Shad doing...
I love the new opening and the Epic brawl between everyone xD
Something fishy is going on again
