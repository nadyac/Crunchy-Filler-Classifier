I love how Minato keeps checking to see if Naruto turned out okay and isn't stupid.
It's a anime law: A powerful enemy will always emerge from a big explosion without a scratch on him.
FMA are you dumb or just didn't watch all of it?

@Hahajc - you ain't seen nothin' if you didn't see the Soul Eater anime. They literally did what you just described, without exaggeration. Immortal God dies to a soft punch, dies to his own madness (madness was his power).
Mereum vs. Netero. Your argument is invalid.
More like Shonen law. There was anime before DBZ. But ya, i know what you are sayin. Atleast back then it was novel. I remember the 1st time i saw napa emerge from smoke after chiaotzu dramatic suicide bomb. Now, its like matrix bullet-time

@megatoncitizen He's just saying that because he's too silly to admit he protected Naruto cause they're still friends. ^_^
hehe everyone asked if he was a jinchuriki, as if they person they asked are an expert the 1st 2nd hokage, dude your wife was a jinkchuriki :I

jinchuriki is the term for someone who holds a tailed beast so naruto is a jinchuriki sence he has the 9 tails. So to answer your question naruto was allways a jinchuriki and sasuke doesnt get any tailed beasts so he doesnt become one

arghhh wish they would have made this weeks episode a two parter instead of last weeks.

the definition of a filler is a episode or string of episodes they have to put in because they are catching up to the story of the manga. they are practically done with this arc, so they don't need a filler now that is a promotion.
Thank god we don't have a filler this week.
lol that was one of my main worries.. i am so glad that they had a double episode last week, rather than extending the mecha naruto filler over the past two weeks
"Naruto focus" Most used line ever in this series.
Not as oft-used as "Sasuke-kun!"
Juubito op, plz nerf.
waiting for patch
More like O-Buu-to or O-kira.
Volvo fix plz
"Rasen-flash Super-Circle Dance Howl Stage Three". Omg by the time you say the jutsu, you're going to be done with it already minato. lol
It's better than "Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero" I suppose, but man, he really sucks at naming techniques
I was thinking the exact same thing. I absolutely love his naming sense, lol.
Don't forget about the rasengan. He at least named that well.
Hey, Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero is a fabulous name.
You got that right
The manga readers know what's up. It only gets epic from here on out.

There is still better tactics in these battles than in DBZ even this late in the game. Just cause you have a world destroying move doesn't mean you will win.
They don't need to explain things in depth because everything about their world has been explained. Obito's new powers were even explain in some detail. But people just like to complain
Random power boost to eventually beat Madara and the ten tails?!? Explained idk
The old fights were the best though. Saturdays eating ramen on Toonami.
All of these fans saying the animation was great lol... Did you about cream yourself when you watched the Kakashi vs Obito fight? Now that's some real animation. This is choppy, and generally just a still frame. Have some standards.
@AnimeView1 attention to detail bro. Obviously you don't have that. This episode's animation was crappy, I was looking forward to it whole week thinking the animation quality from OvsK will remain and fight scenes will be as awesome.

Stop complaining this fight wasn't even a fight. Why waste money when the good stuff is comin later
Obito is on his period and feeling extremely bloated.
Wow...I'm speechless. This was amazing and totally worth the wait!

i like fillers i dont want the anime to be exactly like the manga its a great way to take a break from all the seriousness and to have a good laugh or to see a storyline from the past that we havent seen( i.e Kakashi's story)
@cookiemonster3976 If you really care about the story, read the manga. Since I already know everything that happens, I enjoy a filler once in a while. A nice, original story that i don't know the ending to.
5:40 - :"But... My Lincoln Log attack has never failed before!"
I can't take Minato seriously with those ridiculous jutsu names.
We can rebuild him we have the technology! Cue the 6 million dollar man song!
One of the most satisfying battles.. ever.... But damn that was one big-ass shuriken lord third had xD
i thought this was one of the best fights weve had in months haha
What do you mean? Kakashi's fight with obito was great and that was only 2 weeks ago!
well that was only 5 min long.. im talking about fights that last an episode long or longer
This was just them getting blown to bits. A LOT. Kakashi's fight with Obito has to be one of the best I've seen in anime period.

Because Sharingan.
Obitos will is stronger apparently.
Oh my god Obito is an absolute bad ass now!
*Yawn*. Everyone and their dog is a badass in Naruto at this point. I would be more surprised if he wasn't a badass and has to use his brains to pose a significant threat. That would be great.
"Shikamaru, you would make an great hokage".... Maybe he will shnag narutos post
Why does he look like Ichigo from Bleach in his banki mode?
Obito needs to get himself together.....heh....heh.....
