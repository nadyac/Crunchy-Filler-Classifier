I will be sad when Bleach reaches its final end.
"inside me is the power of a hollow" Ichigo's thoughts: "oh, that is SO last arc" lol
Byakuya be like: Mess with Ichigo, I keeeel you!
You know what, everyone should be thankful for Ichigo having that Combat Pass. Can you imagine the influx of people with spiritual powers around Ichigo if he wasn't held in check?

"inside me is the power of a hollow" Ichigo: "wow, was I this annoying when I put my mask on? No wonder all my friends turned against me"
LOL toshiro : kuchiki and kuchiki aren't here LOLOL ohhh and kenpachi.
LMAO, I like how they snuck the "To be continued" in there.
So, it monitors your movements and sees what things you're into. What's the big deal? Google does that.
did he really think theyd let him run around with that much power unchecked? lol
Well he didn't think that. That's the point.
LOL....Kuro...true...the power of a hollow eh? gee. I know NOTHING bout that lololol
I knew it. Kuchiki's got a man crush on Kurosaki. Kurosaki grows up?
omg i don`t want this sow to end ='(
I love this show entirely too much for it to end <3 y.y
so next episode huh? :/ it was a blast .. i really hope they bring back the bleach anime, that would really brighten up my days inside my room on my computer :') BLEACH AND NARUTO ALL THE WAY!!


We all have our opinions don't bash people cause of them.
is this the second to last episode T_T ???
i think there's more in the manga
They'll probably continue the anime once the manga finishes.

me to

it would be great if the hollow inside kurosaki takes over him ..hehehe as i like that hollow better than kurosaki
the battle would have been abit more epic and last another episode or 2 if they both used the hollow power, sad that hollow ichigo is gone
is that mentioned in the manga? even when he lost his powers both times he still has the same sword, isn't hollow Ichigo just Zangetsu?
After the final getsuga tenshou, Zangetsu disappeared, that's why he didn't want Ichigo to know about it in the first place

@DarkAnimeFan117 Spoiler that shit you fucking cunt.
I can't help but notice this, but Kurosaki and Uryu.... gosh they make it too easy for fangirls to imagine a yaoi version of these too...
im really glad they are ending the show. It will give a chance for the manga to get ahead and we wont have to put up with 100's of soccer fillers. Plus, even though it hasn't been announced we all know bleach will come back in a year or so
Speaking from almost 2 years later... nope

Well @Cyan the arc still isn't finished. Also @Ryuujin, in the case of something like that how does copyright law work? I don't know if things are different in Japan and isn't it Kubo's IP so he can give anyone the right to animate it?
that was the sexiest to be continued i seen lol
Ichigo: Human, Hollow, Soul Reaper, Fullbringer, (Super?) Soul Reaper. I mean, they said it was possible to get soul reaper powers back after losing them, so can he get his original powers back as well as his current ones?
