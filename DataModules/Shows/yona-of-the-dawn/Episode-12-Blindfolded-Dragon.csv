Those damn kids, thinking they could just leave him out from playing Medieval Beyblade.
OMG stop...I...Can't...Handle...The Nostalgia...FLASHBACKS
Medieval beyblade is the sh@%#, I spent so many days making my new weight from limestone.
Lol isn't it just a spinning top? Like a dradle and so forth? That's basically the whole concept for Beyblade XD
i still have all my beyblades and my beystadium lol.
That's f****** magical.
I, for one, thought his eyes were gorgeous. Stupid villagers. >.>
i know! such pretty eyes! shame they are being hidden :/
I would reply but I'm paralyzed... ..wait..
such a shame he and his powers are treated like that when the blue dragons always protected the village.
@kiritosaber They are. Aside the ignorance and the fact that they were stupid, those eyes (at least so far) have proven to be lethal if you watch them, so although they were pretty you would die admiring 'em.
Omg that voice <3 <3!
"A little fan service for you today" Appreciated. Now all together now! *squee*
No replies needed...

*nods in approval*
DODGE!
"Get all the treasure! Search all drawers and pots!" They've got the Link mentality I see. Destroy pots and look through stuff for treasure! Even cut the grass!
The Chiptune version of the opening theme was pretty funny, too.
obviously.
"How do we know that real life as we know it isn't just some hi-res RPG programmed into existence by a higher intelligence?" ...and now I wanna rewatch Steins;Gate. See ya in two weeks, everybody!
hououin kyouma!!!!!!!
LEVEL UP!
very sad back story least we know he found at least one friend! *chirp chirp* and we know he's about to make a few more!
Screw the villagers, if the chipmunk accepts him, he's good by me.
Made me cry and the character was only just introduced. Well played, Akatsuki no Yona. Well played.
This episode felt too short.
True, but don't they all? This show is one I should have waited to finish and then marathon through. It's one where I hate waiting each week but am so happy when the new episode comes out, then it's over too fast.


Maybe Blue Dragon should move to White Dragon's village when this is all over, hehe. Or you know, join a whole new tribe with his new friends.
$5 says one's a freeloading jackass
lol, Wheezy-P
8-bit Yona lol
I want the 8-bit song now!
I'd take that as a ringtone. Would sound so nice.
what you guys talking about ??
The part where Yona & co start searching the cave that looks like a NES/Famicom(3rd gen) game. The consoles of the 2nd & 3rd used generation consoles used a 8 bit processor. Sega Master System/Mark III was among the 3rd gen 8bit for short
While I'm at it I'll take a Yona 8-bit ringtone.
"I wonder why I'm not afraid." Well, they do say blue is a very calming color.
His power is so calming it paralyzes.
All of my logic has been thrown out the window over a SQUIRREL!
Squirrels will do that to you. They're dangerous little critters.
I wish January 6th would come faster!!!
Not me, I have so many bills to pay from all the Holiday seasons. I just wish the episode would come faster. It's a double edge sword.
^That. All of that. :3

this has to be the best backstory for most characters in the show (':
Right? Just from the backstory, my second favorite ship is Yona and Blue Dragon, next to Yoku.
It looks more like a chipmunk than a squirrel, but I'll forgive it because cuteness.
That cuteness tempted Yona into danger! Keep an eye on that squirrel...
Someone needs to give Seiryuu a hug, he seemed so lonely... Good thing he's been found now. It's so sad the Blue Dragon's descendants have been treated like monsters.
People fear what they don't understand. Add Mom mentality to it and you have something truly fearsome. It's sad but people are the scariest monsters of all sometimes.
^^ to add on the fact that his mom committed suicide.
Why do we have to wait two weeks for the next episode? I can't! I need to see the next one soon! T___T In any case, Seiryuu is so adorable! And yes, the translations need double-checking. It's KIJA, not Gija. lol
I think they changed it to match Funimation's spelling (based on Funi's recent promo vid) but it still makes me mad 'cuz the romanization looks weird and doesn't match the pronunciation. The Japanese spelling uses a k-sound. RAR.
Yona, still controlling her harem like a boss

Sad backstory, those villagers can screw off.
Pretty depressing episode, glad Ao went down the redemption path at the end instead of staying a cold hearted bastard because of his life. An impressive self-enlightened path to achieve considering his entire life was spent in solitude with
nothing but hate from everyone around him. WP good sir Ao
