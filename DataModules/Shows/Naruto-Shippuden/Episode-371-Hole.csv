look at 22:54 However, doesn't Sasuke wear a sleeveless top? could that arm be someone else ?


@ArtMaker32123 what in the world are you talking about?
This chakra.... HASHIRAMA!! xD
I loved that part lol

madara has a chubby for hashirama.
Madara totally had a boner that moment. "HASHIRAMAA"
lol Madara is such a fanboy!! ^__^
quick everyone, lets do absolutely nothing while powered by 9 tails chakra!

my thoughts exactly ironskillet
thanks
-psuedo jinchuriki here, let me help... *stand around doing nothing* Glad I could help!
The guy from stone village and his daughter are prob like WTF?!?!?! why is everyone jus standing there while we're about to be killed restraining the ten tails.


Ya know, everybody is talking about Minato appearing in the next episode due to seeing the kunai in the preview. I have a feeling he's going to show up just in time for "To Be Continued" lol
@saoiray You're gonna make me cry. I don't want Minato to appear at that time!
That would suck. Minato appears and says "Hey, I'm jus in time to help you guys fight the ten tails....next week--see ya then....." and the shows ends.......
But that kunai might be the one Minato gave Kakashi
Kakashi is still badass.
Should read latest manga chapter. He's BADASS in there.
"Everyone! Let's join together and fight as one!" WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU DO THAT 10 MINUTES AGO WHEN YOU HAD NINE-TAILS CHAKRA!?!?!
because that would require logic. >.<
Please understand...they're too scared to move. =)) Can't blame them.
Why do these episodes only feel like 5mins long everytime
5 mins of new footage.

Well the typical way anime goes these days is 2 minute intro (3:30 in One Piece's case) followed by a 3 - 5 minute recap. A different angle of the same conversation for another 5 minutes. Half charging up/screaming then a figh-- next week
hotty dad on the way to scare yo arse for beating up his son
Damn it .. oh well.. hopefully in the next epiosde we get to seee the epic battle. But hot damn that was awesome when madaara said he felt hashiramas chakra
Madara is just excited because all the current ninja are too lame to fight him. He's like a charizard vs an army of metapods and kakunas.. Without naruto and a few others theres only one way it can end.
^ way to funny lol
Allied Shinobi Army used harden. Juubi uses cataclysm. Its super effective.

Shonen Jump World confirmed for Kingdom Hearts 3.

Well part of that was due to a genjutsu by Obito, so that Kakashi would be forced to do nothing but stab him. But its Kakashi's fault before that.
Speaking of Obito, doesn't anyone else expect him to say, "Banishment - This World!" No? Just me? Okay.
These titles are getting dirty. Next time..."Something to fill the hole"
So happy to see that I wasnt the only one thinking that!

Hey I guess there is a first time for everything.
Shit is about to get real in next episode, Minato is in the house baby!
hell yeah!!!
thats what we all said the previous episode, they drag the episodes out so long and minato will probably arrive at the end of the episode making us wait even more
I love the Third Hokage. I can't wait for him to kick up a shitstorm, as well as the Second. I'm interested in seeing what he can do. And generally just seeing all 4 working as one unit, that will be epic.
I know it ain't me but that 10 tails is getting uglier every time they show it.
He's like a giant, albino Gumby.
So.... I may be dumb but I don't understand why Obito can't just put himself into a permanent genjutsu to make himself think everything is fine. Why does he have to drag everyone else into it as well?
Good question I would love to hear an answer to this. My guess is that he thinks he is doing the world a favor and it would be selfish of him to do that for himself and not for the rest of the world. Pretty twisted logic but that's my guess
Because there's a misconception about Obito's motivation. He's not just trying to bring Rin back, he wants to create a world where people will no longer have to experience pain and suffering, a world where everyone gets what they want.

Pretty much what Nagato/Pain wanted, before Naruto changed him. But Obito's plan is far worse than Pain's was, maybe relatively. Pain wanted to use the Tailed Beasts to bring peace from war and pain, Obito wants to control reality.
ugh, i wanted to see the hokages in this episode
FUCK MY LIFE! Gotta wait till next Thursday now ;-;!! Ahh well lol looking forward to it since now it seems the hokages will arrive. Should be interesting.
Man i really expected Minato and Narruto to meet -.-. Ugh..
