I think you are all undermining naruto's growth, in terms of who has grown the most
Obito seriously bought into Madara's goal to create the 10 tails & make the genjutsu that would "bring peace" into the world. Remember, he wants to bring Rin back & live within this genjutsu as well. So, he probly thought the same of Minato
what was even the point of tossing the flowers aside?
From what i understand, Obito doesn't see Kakashi's side in all of this. All he knows is that he saw Kakashi kill Rin and he hates him for it. He probably thinks that Kakashi putting flowers on Rin's grave is an insult to Rin's memory.
And here I thought he left Kakashi alive because he actually had enough sense to realize that Kakashi would never kill Rin unless there was no choice. So much for assuming basic intelligence in the characters...
Yeah, Danzo where were YOU when all of that was happening??? Haha.
The Akatsuki's recruitment strategy was probably just to follow Danzo around and approach all the people he left in his wake >_>
haha skam22 the Akatsuki were left in his wake also. they just showed danzo screwing them over too. royalraider thats so funny, and so true too.
Deep Forest Emergance from Danzo's face!

Haha #Rekt *3rd laugh*
Damn Kakashi's backstory is actually really sad ... His dad killed himself, he's the reason Obito died, he killed Rin, and then wasn't able to do anything to save Minato. Thats the kind of backstory you'd expect to see from a villain.

But he didn't see that part of the story...
Everyone goes through dramatic situations. It's how you deal with them that turns you into a hero or a villain.
Hell yeah, @raller. So true.
@redsox0129 Tragedy in ones life does not dictate there morality. Just because i lost my child (among other things), does not make me a bad guy. Its the choice that one makes when confronted with the tragedy & inevitability of death.
If you think about it, wood style is pretty boss. The ability to create life force is pretty handy.
That's because it is. He was able to use Wood style by implanting Hashiramas DNA into him.
But Hashirama's style is on a whole other level. Even if Madara stole it, its just not the same.
I really don't see the appeal of it, or why it's supposed to be so strong. Surely getting struck by lightning or burned with fire would be more damaging than getting twatted with a branch?
if you think about it wood style is extremely more versatile that most jutsus also Core1019 wood style can be used to control tailed beasts dont u think that itself can make it more powerful than rest jutsu
Actually wood style incorporates water style, so fire wouldn't be very effective against it, although I guess if it's anything like the combination attacks that they do occasionally, it would mainly be water strengthening stone.
The writer is doing an amazing job making Danzo the most hated villain in the history of all anime.
Danzo may have claimed it was for the village, but it never was. Everything he did was entirely self serving. He is the literal definition of evil.

@Spiro12 Nay, he may want power for himself, but I can guarantee you he'd use that power to better protect the village, since that's the only thing he cares about.
Danzo may seem like the cause of everything, and he is the cause of alot, but you have to realize this is all to protect the Hidden LEaf, thats all that matters t ohim, even if his way is twisted
Danzo was pursued his own ideals and was contemptuous to those who disagreed. In that way he was very selfish. But you can't call him self-serving-- everything he did was in the sincere belief that it would help the village, not himself.
That was Kakashi's answer to everything back then. Chidori.
hahahahha
Just like Naruto: kage bunshin no jutsu...oh man am I glad we're past those days.
if sasuke mastered it better its because he had the sharingan to begin with. but kakashi had chidori, then got a sharingan so he still mastered it, jus took longer.
plus Kakashi had to create it from scratch and sasuke had one of the world's greatest teachers to learn it from
So chidori was basically old school gastuuga, eh? I know it's not the same thing but it has the same concept...
I love how that one guy uses a telescope defensively.

Holy shit, is that Yamato?! It's been years since we've seen him!
Isn't yamato currently stuck in a wall or something? I don't remember or care anymore.
i'm guessing they're going to refer to him as tenzou in this

Yay! Next weeks episode looks amazing. I have been waiting for Yamatos back story for ages
@Emogla BWAHAHAHA!
I wouldn't expect a whole lot about Yamato past what we already know. There's still some room left in the manga to give his story.
They do seem to be taking some liberties in having him work for Danzo, as I don't recall it ever being said in the manga or anime that Tenzo/Yamato was ever part of root.
It was assumed because Yamato was Orochimaru's shot at reviving Mokuton-style jutsu and Orochimaru and Danzo were working pretty close and since Danzo created Root for gifted child shinobi
then why in hell not have the only living person able to use Wood-style? Then again, it may be that the writers didn't want to think a bunch and just said: "Well this fits nicely here" jajaja
awwww Itachi and baby Sasuki look so cute together!!
Why is Itachi's voice deeper than Kikasi's
Because, he was born a badass.
lol i super like your comment unstopabl3
:likeaboss:
Itachi =(
I like how Kakashi gets his own episodes but Sakura doesn't.
shes not worthy
if anyone wants sakura's backstory here it is: Sasuke,Sasuke,Sasuke,Billboard Brow,Billboard Brow,Sasuke,Billboard Brow *FLICK* Billboard Brow,Sasuke,Sasuke, *is a dumb bitch entire time* Sasuke,tells naruto she loves him, and we're back.
everyone except tenten she gets no screen time ever!
...roadtosakura
@shaanbullet Don't YOU remember hen she told Naruto that she loves him? The reason most certainly was not to just fuck with his feelings.
I am lil confused based on the fact they he watched over Naruto's mother during her pregnancy. and His sensi being Naruto's dad. why are Kakashi and Naruto not closer, he seemed to choose sasuke over him.
@digitalsleep. 1. it's because Kakashi knew that Jiraiya would look after Naruto. 2. Sasuke lost his family just like Kakashi walked in on dead parents in front of them, 3. Kakashi has sharingan eye so he can teach him who else have it?
Plus Naruto was a pretty annoying kid.
Knowing the nine-tails was sealed inside Naruto, he may have been afraid to give him too much power, to the point that he could not handle. On the other hand, maybe the fact that he did not spoil Naruto so much is the reason why Naruto
had positive growth and Sasuke...didn't.
It wasn't favoritism, its jus as they said, it was way more convenient for Kakashi to teach Sasuke, and Jiraiya to teach Naruto, cuz their jutsu's,and chakra natures were similar
EVERYONE GETS A SAD BACKSTORY. Except Danzo and Orochimaru; they just want to watch the world burn.
haha that was a good one. He would have lost his arm and leg on the way then
@tamimshadat ha ha good one, full metal alchemist reference, ftw!
Orochimaru already lost his arms once...
Unlike certain brothers, Orochimaru can actually bring back the death without any compensation from his own body (apart from using other people's lives.... Oh well
Well Orchimaru does kind of.
Please do the 2 episodes in 1 day again.
But the point kinda still stands, wouldn't you rather know whats happening in the present or in the past ? Considering that there is war going on i would have rather they put this in at a more appropriate time in the story.
If you want to know whats happening in the present try reading the manga.
I'd much rather see well-written fillers like this that take place in the past, than those present day war fillers, when Naruto and Bee were running towards the battlefield for like 3 months straight.
I'd rather have 2 episodes regardless, even if it is backstory, or filler, cuz if you think about it, they would air them both either way, but if they do 2 then you get to the newer stuff sooner, if not then you have to wait another week.
Yeah these are fillers for the reason you said. It not part of the main plot.arc and doesn't advance the plot further. Automatically making it a filler, wheter you consider it one or not it is.
well Kakashi ruined it by saying those things to rins grave out loud. Way to go Kakashi tipped obito off.
I kno right? I was thinking the same thing when I saw this episode, cuz I wonder if Obito would of ever known about Kushina being pregnant if Kakashi didn't say anything by Rin's grave..........
Great episode. I love how they've handle all this.. ALl the diff perspective of the same events have been epic.. cant wait for next ep!

Oh gotta say loving this side of the story!
Why's kid Itachi's voice so much deeper than Kakashi/Gai's? LOL
