Everything changed, when the dragon nation attacked.
Why consider Avatar the Last Airbender a non-anime? I have to disagree. It was made in US that's true but with Japanese artists following Japanese comic/animation style. If you go by the definition of anime AtLA is an anime.
manga = comic anime = cartoon or animation The only difference is in country and style.
The studio that made ATLA is actually Korean.
Godzilla poked his head out when they were closing doors. LMAO
...Dude, that was a wolf dragon ...
Shame on the good guys two times. Once for not realizing how 10,000 dragons from the past would get to their world, and the second for not realizing it might take a DRAGON SLAYER to SLAY a DRAGON.
I was thinking the same thing about natsu eating the flames of the fire dragon... will he power p even more bcuz its a different type of dragon flame? and why hasnt anyone considered zapping the dragons withthe etherion cannon?

how about just read it ! you will find your answer
Where is Dovakin when you need him! lmao
they have god slayers and they couldnt even do anything about the dragons
This whole episode, the princess is thinking: "Holy Shit! I Fucked Up Biggggggggggggg Time!!!"
Wallace Shawn thumbs up your comment semajnassiw as do i
Either there is some serious plot holes / fridge logic going on here or they weren't supposed to reveal the 400 years in the past part when first talking about the original eclipse plan in the translation. It was so obvious...
And this is how we get Dragons!
See what 2 girls can accomplish when they put their tits together?!
HAHA lol your comment just made my day



After I noticed during that scene that Cancer has those symbols looking similar to 69s all over his shirt, I kind of stopped thinking about anything but how goofy most of the spirits look again.
... Those "symbols that look like 69s" is the actual astrological symbol for the sign of Cancer, you plebeian.
Lucy: I must close the portal Everyone: O_O Lucy: MY SPIRIT ANALYZED IT Everyone: DRAGONS... WHAT THE HELL DO WE DO
But wouldn't the future Lucy have met her future self? Time loop. O_O
unless future lucy(dead) hit different dimension/branch of possibilities so the future lucy(alive) n this present dimension doesnt have 2 time travel back due 2 the world being saved now so that future lucy(dead) doesnt have that knowledge?
the future lucy said she was in prison when dragons attacked, different time line, she changed her future when she came back and saved them, so her future where natsu is dead, she lost an arm, and everyone is destroyed will no longer happen
The order of events is that the 10,000 dragons destroyed everything as stated, then Lucy went back in time and stopped it from happening. This was followed by Rogue going back even further leading to current events.
Go watch Stein's Gate.





Spoilers are only allowed for this EPISODE, Don't spoil stuff from future episodes/the manga plox


I feel like I'm angry at the end of every episode because NOTHING happens until the last 5 minutes, then CLIFFHANGER-FROM-HELL... Every episode.


@Terrolol crossing fingers that I see cobra whipping ass on some dragons.

they already do get bigger every episode anyways
thats the joke
It's time for the dragon slayers to shine.
"Natsu, wake up!" she cries. "I've gotta go, my dragon senses are tingling," he proclaims. Ok, so the last part I made up, but that's how it should have been.
next episode: natsu kicks rogue's ass with the power of friendship. :3
Doesn't he always win with the power of friendship?
My question is, what the hell happens to Rogue in the future for him to kill Sting, want to take over the world and hate Natsu so much? Damn it Rogue, just a few episodes you learned the power of friendship.
that evil shadow was the future rogue that took over his past self during the fight
Was anyone else just waiting for Natsu to eat that flaming dragon?
Yeah, that would of been awesome.

Because more dragons don't equal better television. And it's not like it's called Game of Dragons...
it's hard to wait a week to watch Natsu kick some booty
I will gladly wait a week, if you never say booty again....
Arse, ass, butt, anus, rectum. Whatever floats your boat, bruh.
"Oh my god another is coming out of the portal! Let's stand around and not try to close the portal and watch as 10 more pour out!" My god I almost forgot how big of a plothole that was in the manga. Thanks for the refresher.
@football_star you mean like with Wendy getting plowed over by Lucy when she was sent flying? Seriously Wendy literally says "Go close the gates Lucy!" While laying down. Like "haha nope, I'ma take a nap, you go do the thing"
Hrm.. Plot Hole, or Plot Portal?
You said ten when they clearly said Seven multiple times...
Portal..... the cake is a lie...
@drake I made this before they said seven dragons. also it's called an exaggeration to prove a point. I wasn't trying to be perfectly correct on this one, it got the point across didn't it?

Apparently I got ding-dong ditched during that part. My door bell rang so I angrily confront the poor soul who dare interrupt my Fairy Tail, yet nobody was there. I'll get you next time, ding-dong ditcher.

What a coincidence!!!! My ding dong was being played with during that part as well!!
Easy. Cobra is in the =Council's= holding facilities, not the palace's. Which are....some distance away, let us say....
I miss the old art style and music
The animation and art for sure is worse than the first series. The openings are gorgeous but the actual episodes...
The music is good but the art style is all over the place
Please get the old art house back. You have eyelines -over- hair blowing in the wind, a serious lack of shading and shadows, bad camera angles and very poor attempts to do the characters justice. Cheap, quick, and poor QC.
At least we get blood, if even a little.
Well, they subbed it out to the Chinese animation group "Who Flung Poo".. little brown spots of animation are to be expected...

i loled so hard when he said that
Status effect magic....Debuff and buff spells?
*Ichiya uses perfume!* *rock dragon loses 60 defense points out of 22,000! Ichiya:"I don't think it worked"
I Love this show but this episode pissed me off so much they spend 20 minutes just to show that natsu is going for a rematch a dragons came through the portal!!!
Even though i love boobies, but man lucy boobs are getting bigger every episode and its starting to look nasty
mada mada
@hatoriku I think you mean, "men men".
"Lucy! Lucy! Shut the portal!" Why doesn't anyone help her!?!?
Only Celestial Spirit Magic can be used and very few Mages are left that can use it.
But before then, when they thought only the lever (or whatever that was) had to be pulled, and she was struggling just to get to it?
It seems you need Celestial Spirit Power to pull that level to close? It was said at 13:20 they need more.
