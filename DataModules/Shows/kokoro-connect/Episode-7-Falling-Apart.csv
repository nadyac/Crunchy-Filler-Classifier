Anyne else feel like we are heartseed and we're justwatching this for entertainment?
AHAHAHA that was actually my first thought when I started watchin this series...really cool I think
Don't mind me eating this popcorn as all of this unfolds.
The Kokoro Connect Controversy makes more sense now. They made Heartseed real.
Heartseed is actually just a reality TV show producer.
anisparagus your pick is perfect for your coment
I think the key to resolving this arc will be the friends finally realizing that it is Inaba who needs help this time, not Yui--she's a false flag. This arc embodies Inaba's worst fears, note her sarcasm at the others problems being simple.
They need to realize that they are friends. You need to accept your friends for who they are, even when they aren't at their prettiest. This may be a little My Little Ponyish, but i think the power of Friendship can conquer this arc.
yes Inaba is having a hard time through this and everyone seems to be worrying about yui instead
Great to see the love for Inaban. I really do feel for her too. She's my favourite character because she's not perfect, but she's still very loveable and probably more relateable because of it.
Well, you know there are variety types of people. It depends on the individual of each person. Are they compatible? Are they capable of breaking through AND ABLE to recover from the breakthrough of the arc?
Good observation. This is really about Ibana because she's the weak link in the group even though she acts so strong. She feels inferior and out of place compared to everyone else. This needs to be resolved.
Am I the only one who thought Inaba was about to throw herself in front of the train?
Imagine if it was both their desires and body swapping...the desire of the personality of course. much more fun
I'm imagining a very awkward situation for Taichi, in which Inaban and Aoki swap bodies, and she's been on her computer doing some "research" again.
Its team effort. Like straight out legit. No bailers, traitors, all team effort. Everybodys pitching in the equal amount of effort to survive
I always unleash my desire to sleep.... more
Interesting that "letting their impulses loose" seems to make them act more like normal teenagers, at least American ones.
Most teenagers don't jump up and shout "YAHOO" in class. Neither do they have the sudden urge to strip in front of their friend's sort of boyfriend. Beating up stupid dudes, maybe, but none of them can kick ass the way a karate champion can
sounds like my high school to me...

This show would be great even if it was live action, that's what I love about it. I show this to friends who aren't sure about anime because I don't need to justify it's short comings with 'this is an anime man, get over it'
right, because american teenagers are so different from "regular" teenagers... get over yourself dude
Ughhhh so excited. Been needing a good fix like this ever since I finished Angel Beats. <3 <3
Totally, I'm re-watching this, so glad to be watching a genuinely great anime amongst the countless 'this could be good but it's really dragging on', 'why does this have an 8 on MAL...' and 'it's great, but the next episode is in a week'
Heartseed always wants to make it interesting, and his actions generally lead to character development. But, if they didn't develop, we wouldn't be as entertained, either. So in a way, Heartseed's an extension of the audience. Scary, huh?
I'm not sure everyone would use his methods for development, but that aspect of the plot definitely makes this anime unique in my perspective. And yes thinking of him being an extension of the audience is kinda scary haha
*we all hear something*. Turn around, "Its Heartseed yelling "TROLLLOLOLOLOLOL" on the streets"
When Inaban was shouting at Yui all I could think about was how Yui's mom could have been listening.
Damn, seriously detrimental to a relationship. It actually makes me realize how much people hold back what they feel for the sake of others. It would be a terrible world if no one could control their desires. Even more so than it already is
I like how when Taichi when off on Inaban then snapped out of he didn't apologize. It's like he knows that he was having an episode, but he also took responsibility for what he said.
Heartseed is like excelerating their maturity...
*accelerating.
grammar nazi*
@HinataRukia, you see, Heartseed mentioned it. "It may suit you to your benefit" something like that.
I don't think we've seen Inaba's deepest desires released yet. I imagine it'll be something when we do. And she was right to chew out Yui. The other's should really follow her advice as much as possible in their situation.
Never. Point out to a girl that she has a zit on her face.
Finally, someone said it!
Dammit Heartseed, play a video game or something!
Up vote for both the comment and the avatar.
talk about shit hitting the fan
Are we like that Heartseed, when we're watching that anime for entertainment?
its amazing how this show feels so developed only 7 eps in
to anyone hating on heartseed.... all he's doing is essentially the same thing you are doing every time you load up an episode!
Although I don't think it should be as direct a comparison as that. Heartseed is doing things we could never do; watching people develop is different from forcing them too. Still makes for a good show though
@BluRift, There is 2 things I will tell you. First, many people could do that process that Heartseed is doing but in an different way. Second, don't underestimate this world.
IT WAS THE SNACKS.
