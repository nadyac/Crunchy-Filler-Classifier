The thing I regret most about this series is not knowing the back-story to Ichigo's father.
Can someone point me to a good place to read the manga? I can't find one.
Tenmanga, Mangafox, Managreader, Mangastream. Try some of those jlellis.


So is there another series regarding ichigo's parents? I watched everything and didnt see/learn much about his parents at all.
Great...now I have to wait for Bleach Shippuden to come out

its been confirmed, its coming back. 2015
where did you see confirmation of the anime coming back?
It's obviously going to come back. When? We don't know.
Dude, this last arc is amazing it's got allot of view around it! the demand is high again for bleach. but they said it most likely will come back in 2015! remember this isn't the first time we had to wait a while for bleach to come back!
I kind of grew up watching this show, I hope it comes back soon! I feel like I've lost a friend

Hopefully it comes back :'(

I feel like they need to finish this, but it's sadly all about sales. :l
so...did anyone else think riruka was going to commit suicide?

Yeah... I did.
I did, lol.
ikr i did
Sure did!
Finished so long ago...... how I wish this could come to my life...... every Tuesday I would look forward to seeing this anime. Hope it comes back or I am going to have to watch it all over again.
For those who were asking about Isshin's and Urahara's Back stories, I am certain that they will touch on them when the series re-continues. Based on Manga chapter to anime episode ratios, we're looking at another 2 yrs before they can ...
I will be willing to wait for those two years if i have to.
As long as it comes back I can be patient
Its coming back at the end of this year
@Modnick If your right, Imma be so happy but I have litte hope for it considering how little episodes it would have. I would agree for another 2-3 years before its coming back.
Despite all the "it's not ending" comments... this sure does feel like a satisfying ending... I really hope it keeps going though. I've grown attached to this anime.
All good animes have an "end". If they don't end then you get something like Dragonball GT.
With Dragonball, the manga ended that's why GT sucked so bad. Bleach's manga is still going so it shouldn't end until that's over.
I watch all the show I really enjoyed hopefully more new on the way..
Jeez did Dragonball GT suck so bad. Also the difference between FMA and FMA Brotherhood shows how following the manga makes things much better.
Feel like i said goodbye to a very close friend....
omg i feel like im going to cry this show has literally become apart of me
For those interested in re-watching the series. At an average of 24 minutes per episode, it will take you 6.1 days to watch it. Or 146.4 hours. Have fun.
Cont. from above itll be about 2 more years before they can drop 52 episodes in a year like they try to. I do not doubt that, they are currently making the scripts and frames for the anime, but holding completed work until ready to restart.
Ehh took me a week skipping fillers.
6 days, a week? pretty much same thing lol
for me it was more like 6 months, not enough time to watch non stop.
I watched it over winter break. Started on the 23rd, finished it on the 4th. Its not a record or anything, but it shows how many friends i have :/
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CANT BE OVER PLEASE NO I WANT MORE BLEACH
you must let it go my friend
to tell the truth, I didn't see "The End" anywhere did you?

no instead ichigo broke the 4th wall saying see ya again
exactly @chickenMCsnuggles plus there are so many details that haven't been filled in. I know people say to read the manga to find out. but i want to wait to be surprised in the anime... IT HAS TO COME BACK
I'm really sad...I feel like Ive lost a friend

That said, my suggestion would be to read the manga. (The only time I read a manga for detail clarification was with TWGOK, so I understand how tough it is to have to do so. I can appreciate the "read the manga DX<" crowd's thoughts too.)
c'mon guys don't spoil stuff.

@hollamondw I was hoping exactly the same thing
Kenpachi's arc would be nice but I want to see Yachiru in action! You know she's gotta be strong as all get out...she's been with "Kenny" from the beginning!
Crunchyroll needs to stop saying that its newly updated
Man, Ichihime or Ichiruki, I kinda wanted to see him walk up to Rukia and kiss her before he left. You know, at least as an anime ending. =3=

You're wrong, Kenpachi's sword is his Shikai, it has been confirmed. It is the same as Ichigo's constant Zangetsu. His sword became a Shikai when he was a kid because his Reiatsu was too powerful to keep it held back
no, it states that that is NOT a shikai because a shikai requires knowledge of the swords name. It also says that the shape was altered due to his ridiculous lvl of power. it never says that it is in a shikai state, or if it even has one.
does Kenpachi himself specifically say he released it at some point and it stayed that way but he never could control it because he forgot the name over time? something like that.
For all of you who think Bleach is over foreve.Well its not because they said their going to release season 16 this summer or so.So dont give up on Bleach.
It's October nothing yet.... Hey you in the future watching the new bleach season you're one lucky jerk!
I heard it's coming out on Novebruaril 37rd, -4193 BC.
The company that owns the rights to Bleach anime have stated they do not plan to make the final arc of Bleach as it is much to voilent even for normal standards and to many people are killed off. Lame but yeah.
I'm sure Adult Swim will still run it, I'd say produce that violent &%@#!!!
Nov 1, 2014 and no news of a new season yet.
This was a super great end!!! now on to the Manga....
Well this will always be my favorite and most cherished anime,just such an amazing anime! Perfect ending too :).
Its not ending yet
we all know
They should make the final arc into a high quality OVA. Anyone else agree?
nah, I like it more as a bunch of episodes. One OVA caps at a 3hr max, same story as several episodes and last a good 5+ hrs. Longer if they are especially thorough.
In the very last second Ichigo says "See you again" kind of says the anime is coming back right there
NOOOOOOOO!!!!! I cant stand it, it shouldnt e over, ive been watching bleach for so many years now i cant imagine life without new episodes :'( There is so much left un-answered like; who is the soul king, what role does he play.
it is (or will be) revealed, just in the manga. this isnt the last arc, just in the anime it is.
