Misao is warming up to Kenshin, I wonder if her feelings towards him will change when she learns about Oniwabanshu's fate?
HAHAHHA 3:10 to 3:40 is probably my favorite 30 seconds in this entire series
I like when Kenshin runs all funny face like xD
Kenshin played a part is saving Aoshi's life. Aoshi wants Kenshin dead. I see an ultimatum approaching for bandit girl.
why is all the female character in this anime are like that.... bit annoying tbh.. they should make a female companion who's different from kaoru >.<
I think she's supposed to be a reflection of Kaoru, showing Kenshin how much it hurt Kaoru for him to leave her On the other hand, Megumi is now a strong-willed woman!
I have a weird feeling that Misao will be the one who prevents Aoshi and Kenshin from killing each other
Jeez what a hopeless girl..
There goes Kenshin going against the laws of gravity. How did he jump all the way back up?
I'm pretty sure the modeled Misao after lina the bandit slayer somewhat.
What do we say to gravity? Not today!
