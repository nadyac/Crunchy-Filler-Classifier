Sometimes I wish I had girls fight over me. Then I saw School Days...
I think school days is great to watch right after the first White Album. The male characters aren't that different, though the shows end very differently.
@Emonkey yeah he was a dick but u gotta remember that the girl that tried getting him with the one he liked kinf of messed up alot of the stuff too and made him be a bit of how he was.
haha LMFAO!!!! who ever watched school days knows what you mean...
Schooldays: Gets stabbed, Doesn't matter had sex x 54
Nice boat.
Oh my Inaba became cute. That laugh at the end was HNNGH


is it bad I am starting to like Mr. Heartseed?
nah, we all kinda see ourselves in him
yea that Chaotic neutral
Like...I've thought Heartseed was awesome right from the start. Then I disliked him when he threw Iori off a bridge. Then we were cool again. I mean, a little (megaton) bit of trolling never hurt anyone right?
Holy shit guys... DID YOU SEE THAT KITTEN? IT WAS SO CUTE
MAX KAWAII ACTIVATED. BLUSH EFFECTS ONLINE< CHIBI MODE FULLY BOOTED > *Kitten meows DEATH BY CUTENESS ALLERGY *dies
"No wait! I'm allergic to adorableness!!"
NO. I am a man who likes manly shows about fighting and killing and dying and psychological torture. I shall not succumb to - WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Don't fight it just give into the show.
dude you are like 10+ ep into this show hahahaha
Welcome to team shoujo.
Such feels, Much emotion. waaaagh
I'm rooting for both of them. Iori and Inaba! May the best girl win! =D
ye they are both 22 kawaii 4u there is no bias allowed
The description of the episode -_-
haha it makes it sound like a knife fight to the death
I was afraid of a repeat of School Days.

Aw she's just so happy I could curl up in a ball and... and... and just :3 And yes, :3 is now a verb.
I see threesome imminent.
The nice guy gets 2 women ... send me to Japan right now
yeah over here you get 2 hours alone:(
This episode made me smile quite wide.
I'd definitely choose Inaba. She's way more of a perv.
what the hell are you even saying KuchikiCarnage you literally have another comment above saying the opposite
I love Inaba because of her personality XD
Inaba Team for the win just love her personality.
So we're making teams now.... let the bloodshed commence.
Inaba x Taichi for the win
the VA are so good and really put emotion into it!

Kokoro Connect - giving you more complex & entertaining characters in just a few eposides that most shows get in a lifetime.
I know I'm hella late, but if it wasn't for the fact that he threw a girl into a river, Heartseed could actually be a good guy...thing. He's getting everyone to open up and while I'm grateful for that, I still want to know his reasons.

AAAHHHH! Inaba is soooo cute in this episode! Unfortunately, everyone is rooting for Inaba, as am I, and the creators of these sorts of anime ALWAYS make the main male character end up with the female we're not rooting for... >_<
LALALALALALA!!! I'M NOT LISTENING!!! ...Taichi WILL end up with Inaba! He'd better...
Thank god for those last 4 episodes not on Crunchyroll and the LN endings being the same!
In the real world a nice guy like Taichi would've been friend-zoned
