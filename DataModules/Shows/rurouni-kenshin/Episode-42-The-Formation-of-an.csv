In anime, bandages can cure all injuries, even within the same episode.
Great development for Misao-okashira-chama!
I think the best development is Okina. "Ciao, my pretty Misao! <3"
degozaru yo
Okina is pretty badass. He reminds me of the ninja grandpa Fu from Fullmetal Alchemcist Brotherhood.
Aoshi goes Killua
More like sasuke, revenge clouding his head
Shishio-sama, I will follow you!!!!!
yeah straight to hell.
Aoshi is the best..if not the greatest character I've ever seen o~o
Why would you even think that of a character so shallow who only wants the title of the "strongest".
