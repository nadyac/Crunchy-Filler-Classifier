LOL. Kon really planned to fight Kageroza with a rock?
Well you never know lol
I guess he didn't have any chili powder to use

Lulz at how the entier town is oblivious to all the craters and smoke forming all around town
The town is in a time freeze. Urahara did it before they invaded.
can this guy die already i mean like seriously
Okay, Kon has been really annoying throughout this arc, but picking up that rock and charging Kageroza... Totally redeemed himself!!! XD

i love con, he makes everything light. its just too bad that he doesnt do much but talk all the time. thats what makes him awesome anyways

recap ends at 2:38
You know, if Inaba Kazeroga had've worked with Aizen, Aizen probably would've won. Inaba is hard as hell to beat. He even had Genryusai face down with his butt in the air. He's pretty hardcore for a filler villain.
jesus do you people know what the spoiler option is for?
I love this arc! Fuck the HATERS! The producers did good with this story! I like Kon in this arc hes not a liability like on the other arcs. haha Urahara at the end was funny too
bleach and naruto are awsome lol
LOL KON RUSHING AT KAGEROZAA WITH A ROCK! Lol
This is story is out of control! It's pretty crazy but I'm liking it! The animation quality still continues to impress me.
KON IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO TAKE UP SOMBODY GRAVE AND STEAL IT PUT IT BACK FIRST!
dude kon was stuck to it, he had no choice... better to take it if it meant saving a living persons life
lmao i love kon
What the heck did he plan on doing with that rock? :'D

We all know that ichigo can easily defeat this dude, but the problem is that he doesnt have all of his powers, which really sucks. BTW i love the end <3 memeories of the last arc xD
