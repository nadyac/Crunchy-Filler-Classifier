Hopefully, we'll find out what the heck Eren's father has stashed in the basement soon.
If I hadnt been reading the anime, half of these comments wouldn't be half as funny as they are.
The question is: Can Ash Ketchum all
hmm something that eren will need to know...... its porn
ew thats not on a need to know basis -_-
It's porn! It's My Little Pony! It's My Little Pony porn! ...sorry don't kill me I made this up at 3 in the morning
My clock is broken, it's saying 22 minutes have passed already
lol same here haha
Someone (Mikasa preferrably) needs to put a sword to that drugged commander's throat. He's the same chicken who left the trainees to die in HQ in the last episode, and now is trying to call the shots.
yo can we make meth commander fan canon ? i like the nickname it fits him very well
why is kreiger ordering ordanancwe on the trio that we wish turned into a duo of mikasa and eren armin is almost as useful as sakura haruno in naruto or orihime in bleach
I BET EREN'S FATHER HID THE SECRET OF BECOMING ONE WITH THE TITAN!
4 words: HE rounds are unaccurate
i know right i want him to get a sword in the throat hes pissing me off!

It's so epic that i'm still watching it at 2 a.m.... I have to go to sleep but I want to keep watching....
Yeah, I want to do other things, but I can't stop.
wow lol this is my 11th time watching this series
I don't feel your pain, but i can understand it a little bit.
i feel your pain Toonami is in the day before graduation haha
already over ? I've only been watching for 2 m..... wait.... 22min already WTF ?
@ careless270 Ty man for the guest pass your awesome! i used up the first one listed .
I definitely thought it was going to be the first commercial break, and it turns out its the end of the episode. Fastest 22 mins ever
the sign of a great anime
10:11 TITANCEPTION
ikr

They didn't rename him. It's the same name, romanized differently. (The romaji is Rivai. So the fan scanlators went for a more creative romanization.)
In the translations I read, they did his name both ways because, I guess, different groups with different opinions.
there will be an OVA about Levi it will be a prequel to the current timeline
If i'm not mistaken he's consider the best fighter alive even better then Mikasa but not sure on that.
oh you can be sure on that my friend!

@RoyClancy, you must really like a lot of people.

"Come at me, Bro" - Mikasa ".....nah were good" - Entire army
hatorihanzou: unchi o tabete kudasai.
@Resident_Gundam, What did you say? Something about Hattori Hanzo?
I was telling the CR user by that name that wants to post manga spoilers to EAT SH!T.

"You all have the stupidest expressions." - I'm glad someone finally said it.
Man Those Freak'n SMILES are Just creepy as Hell! ha
it's like they're all high or something
the faces make the anime scary, and want to be a part of the killing!
Guess that's the part that makes 'em titans!
Did you just insult my Titan-chan?
These episodes are too short. The awesomeness can't be contained in 22 minutes. It's hard to live each week for such a short jolt of brilliance. Meanwhile, I upped my membership to yearly. Thanks Crunchyroll!
I agree! In the meantime, if you haven't seen the Sword Art Online series that's a good fill for the week. It's another amazing anime like this one! (disregarding Arc 2 of that series could've been better but Arc 1 was AWESOME)
Bomb Queen is awesome.
There are other some of the new anime which are great like Gargantia, Valvrare, Arata, devil survivor 2, just some to feel in my time besides naruto in between these master anime
seriously i just got the trial and watched all of this show. this show and site got me watching new anime again!
What the Hell was that really 20+ minutes that went by way too fast.


Just Wow
excellent synopsis
HOLY SHIT!! that was EPIC

They are killing us with these epic endings. Jeez.
D: yuh.
That ending totally blew me AWWWaaaaYYY, Every freak'n episode IS Never BORING Just Pure Epicness!
Agreed this episode had me at the edge of my seat.
And where is the Funimation Blue ray pre-order. WHERE IS IT?
You'll get it...in 2014.
2014? wishfull thinking, I want future Diary on blu-ray, it it looks like that isn't happening, and it seems the more popular the show is, the less likely chance we get the blu-ray when it first comes out,
What. The. Hell.

Biting his thumb was also a bit like Kuchiose no Jutsu. It was still awesome to watch though!
The thumb-biting just reminded me of Blood+.
Was kind of similar to Sasuke summoning Susano'o LOL
whenever a japanese person wants to injure themselves, apearantly they bite their thumb...
Lord, this director really knows how to adapt manga.
Have you seen Death Note or High School of the Dead? He's pretty good at that.
I loved HOTD
I'm patient... I'm a very patient person... i can wait long periods of time for something I'd want.. BUT THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY! FMD WHERE'S THAT TIME-MACHINE THAT DUDE IS WORKING ON!
Aaaaaarghhhh that anime is freaking awesome I wish it was back on crunchy roll
I started that anime, but only watched half of the first episode. You have inspired me to continue while I wait for next weeks Attack on Titan :):)
calling rintaro okabe.....sunovabitch
SheriBear, I'm new here and don't know how to message you. Steins;Gate is in youtube. The first 6 or so episodes are slow as hell, but funny. Suffer through it to get to the good stuff. IT IS WORTH IT.
Tuturu!

Eren's reaction: "AWWWWWW........what a gip."
Mierda!!!!
omg i'd get pretty close to crying if that was real. cause i've made so many realistic assumptions, but if thats the answer, well then... shit.

Reminds you of the Salem witch trials, no?
When it comes to Voice Acting, Japan is on a whole different level than english voice acting. You dont need to understand japanese to feel the emotions, but english VAs cant seem to pull it off as good.
I guess you haven't heard allot of English voice actors then, There are many brilliant English voice actors then can match and even exceed the original but I assume that comment comes from your love of Japan than the actual content.
Shukuchi I'd give you more than just one thumbs up if I could.
I think the fact that you don't understand Japanese makes the voice acting better. We hear the nuances to the English language every day, which taints how we view our own voice actors, while foreign voice actors can get away with A LOT.
