Slice of afterlife LOL
mhmm
Bleach? This felt much more like Sunday Without God! Thought it's probably Sunday Without God that's like Angel Beats... Watch both and tell me your opinion as well!
the way it starts out is very different than how it wraps up. very good feels toward the end of the series. glad I put up with the lag and stalling issues all the way through.
I'm thoroughly annoyed by all the summaries of these amines. It leads you to think this is just some shooter up action anime. This is by far not that at all. It is so much more.
and I thought it was about music xD
wow I cant belive how long Ive put this anime off. this first episode was awsome. glad to finnaly watch this, better late then never!
my friend told me he cried at the end so i was like "sheeeeet i gotta watch dis"
i cheated and watched the end, and now i know im gonna cry tears of manliness!
"OKAY, Let's dance!" I was like, "..."
In terms of emotional impact, this series shines quite bright, but in terms of plot writing, character development and pacing, it squanders just a bit. It simply isn't long enough for the story it's trying to tell.
Yeaaah, it's 2015 and I'm only just watching it. I love it!
anyone just starting this series, you will feel. you will feel hard
Hell, anyone restarting it for the fifth time will feel hard. (Especially episodes 3, 10, and 13.)
I'm ready, i think...

This comment makes it sound like an ecchi anime...
Good feels or bad feels?
i guess anyone who happend to watch the series will most likely watch it again 3 more times or more. I know i have. ^_^ <3
I could only watch it once. My heart can't take another viewing for at least another five years T_T
try kanokon i think how its prounounced its ones of those its so innapropiate its funny
@dirtjumper771: I think you'd be surprised just how many people watch anime they don't like on this site just so they can downvote people that do like it and load up the comments with complaints.
rewatching again. there's just so much to this anime and all the feels. Also, the attention to detail of this series is amazing, can't get enough of Gldemo!
I only just finished watching this series last night... this is my second time watching
*warning this show changes your life ... forever* you have been warned. dammit i'm crying again... yui!!! *sniff*
Damn! I got so sad from Akame ga Kill i was thinking "hey let watch another anime to distract me"
Lol I saw your account on that! I love akame ga kill and inu xboku!!
First time watching this. I keep hearing about this anime... decided to give it a try.
Same here IncaRose.
I as well IncaRose.
let the tears begin
Love the show. I hope they add Clannad next.
As everyone with Clannad icons respond
I don't have a Clannad icon, I will agree with adding it though...
I don't have one either, but being able to watch Clannad on Crunchyroll would be EPIC. Please, Crunchyroll! Deliver!
Clannad on crunchyroll <3
@RatSpecies .. I love your icon. If memory serves right, it's Ririchiyo's Secret Service guard from Inu x Boku SS, right?
"Screw you battlefront" I know it shouldn't get me as much as it does but it does
OMG THEY PUT THIS ON CRUNCHYROLL!!! so friggin happy
100 hit combo lmao
A great anime was born. When I was watching the ending, Onion ninjas showed up. Them Onions burn my eyes. So horrible I hate Onion Ninjas. They are always everywhere in every world. Beware of Onion ninjas people.
I FRIGGIN LOST IT WHEN HE SED "THE WRIGHT BROTHERS"
I love the song the girl's sing at the concert!!! It's like my new favorite song even though it's in another language.
I really wish i knew the name of the song
im pretty sure it's called The Crow Song
this is one of the best animes ever ive watched this so much and it still gets to me
2nd time watching :3 so GOOD!!!!!!!!
me 2... well maybe 4-5 now, lol
I am watching Jappanese anime so much now that I am starting to understand jappanese! Is that good or bad?
exactly!
Wow, this certainly is a cool concept! Glad I chose to start this series, I feel like it'll be a good one!
The stuff TK says in the background is so great.
This is interesting.. I wonder how good it gets.
Thus series has an excellent opening and ending song.
i know right great song
YESH You are right....the feels bro the feels
