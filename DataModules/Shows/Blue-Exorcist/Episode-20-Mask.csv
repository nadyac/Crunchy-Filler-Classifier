@slarck your picture just goes with your comment xD
@slarck you saying that his comment was a spoiler is the real spoiler
@jypsjulia He is the son of satan he just didn't inherit the powers
When I hear "Son of Satan" I always thing of the Asian stereotype where a guy yells "Spawn of Satan!!!" with short a's.
the real spiderman has arrived

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where are you?
Why is this a spoiler comment?
Hide your tail Rin -___-
uselessflaw- if they can see demons, then they probably have more to worry about than just a normal kid with a tail. they'll be seeing monsters and shit like that all the time. Rin would be mild to them.
@Bamfturkey : But normal people aren't demons. They would ask if they saw a kid with the tail and he has no other explanation than the truth. And you can't just tell people you're the son of Satan.
@mag314shine If they could see demons when others can't, they wouldn't question a kid having a tail they would prob think they are going insane because no one else can see what they can
got to also remember the fact that people who can see spirits/demons = crazy to the general public. basically, even if they were worried, its not like anyone would believe other than an exorcist.
If you saw someone with a tail in Nippon you'd just think he was a cosplayer.
Spiderman really let himself go

Yeh.. even got a sex change. Damn. Too be honest.. he's got spiders who shoot webs.. kinda annoyed that 90% of the comments are like,"OOOO loookie, spider man!". What about their grandfather at the end? Mom info inc, that's massive.
I dont know if I should feel bad for yukio or annoyed.
blue exorcist is the best

I don't see what the big deal is. Rin burned the clothes off of people, burned a swarm of moths surrounding his friend, and randomly bursts into flame for no reason. He's never hurt anyone with those flames he didn't want to. Why train?
He burned Suguro's shirt, and it was only that because he (Suguro) dived out of the way
Actually suguro dove in the way to protect kon what's his name because kon was possessed and no one could see the demon for some reason
i was wondering when they were going to go back to the church
Nah guys it's Spiderwoman wearing Darth Vader's mask!
Jeeze... Darth got ugly. o.o
[This comment has been removed]
More like Darth Vader's face, as a mask, not his mask. Lol..
lol what if the girl in the mask was rins and yukios mother, that would be a twist
I love how they come to the conclusion that "related to Satan" means Rin. Uh, call me an idiot, but even without powers, isn't Yukio related to Satan as well?
So, I didn't notice this the first time I watched it, but... his tail is showing... in public... XD I-I'm *pretty* sure everyday people would find that troublesome.
Humans can't see anything demonic without a temptaint.
good job damionkuro you remember, not you though zoogzin
if they did, remember he is in japan, people cosplay there a lot. He just looks like a demon otuko.
Yukio needs to learn to pull the fucking trigger and start using real bullets
WATCH AFTER THE CREDITS. Important.
Thank you sir!
i want to meet there mother
I'm fairly sure their mom died when she gave birth to them. Was that mentioned or am I imagining it?

According to Homer Simpson it is ~Spider Pig, Spider Pig~
You mean Harry Porker.
holy flying penguins its spiderman!!!
I swear how many times have Yukio pulled a gun out at Rin seriously.
