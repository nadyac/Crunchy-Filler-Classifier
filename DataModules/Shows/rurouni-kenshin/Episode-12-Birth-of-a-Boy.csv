Can I just express my pleasure at how much less annoying Yahiko's voice is in Japanese than English? I like him so much more here, not that I don't enjoy the dub (more for nostalgic reasons than anything).
Right? I literally hated him as a character in English and now I'm over here like yeah, that's how its done Yahiko ma boy. *puffs pipe*
I agree and feel the same if not more so about Kaoru.
the spanish latin america is awesome as the jap.
There are no cicadas in spring! XD
LOL
This show has aged well.
no my friend we have. Shows like this stands immortal.
"he needs to fight this battle by himself" scene cuts to five grown men brutally beating up Yahiko "like a hero"
Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger
"I won't be scared of petty things again." Like a group of thugs trying to murder you.

It must be frustrating to be called chan automatically and not out of malice. xD

yahiko-chan ^-^
yahiko so cute... XD love at first sight ;D
That water.
Well that was surprisingly heartwarming.

Heartwarming indeed.
Cute episode!
Re watching the series. Yet this is the one episode I always remember my fav episode.
But that wasn't his first time fighting a guy with a real sword.. him and Kaoru took on a bunch of guys at Takeda Kanryu's house.
I think this is my favorite of yahiko way to go little man
Some cheese here and there is quite nice "little yahiko" (rolling LOL )
12 episodes in and I still can't get used to it not being 16:9. Those black bars are starting to annoy me
