Tk has no idea half the words he is saying.. ''I kiss you'' while he's attacking... LOL
I feel like the only way to get a program in the world is when inside. Also has anyone else realized that a program has intercepted souls...!
I really wish we could figure out his back story
Look it up, he does have one
lol your profile pic
"Crazy Baby"! hehe(;
Good episode, but it seems less and less likelier that TK is going to get a detailed backstory. It's too bad, because he's pretty much the greatest character ever.
I wish there was a character like TK in all of my anime that I watch.
He would make a perfect AoT character
I KISS YOU! *slices off Titan's head*

I THOUGHT THAT TOO BUT THE BUFF GUY WITH GLASSES WASNT THERE!
Oh he was there, he just wasn't showing them off. What's missing is Kanade.
I know! I'm so happy that there was a group picture of everyone at the end! I love it!
'the buff guy' (Takamatsu) was there but he's pretty hidden by the credits on top of him, he's on the left of Matsushita the 5th c:

This really makes you think about what happens when you die...
two fav anime people: TK and Naoi.
ughh really don't want this to end
Damn this really is a great show.
man i love this but i dont want it to end X(


Guess who cried again...
woooooooooah O__O next episode is the last episode finally made it thru 2 days of watchin Angel Beats
I did the same with clannad (it was a slow weekend >.>) my god was that ever a ride for the ages :'/
Its sad to see people missing in the opener and at the end.... Them feels
there need to be special episodes or ovas explaining other people back story on how their life was unfair

Am i the only one who,d be OK with an entire anime based on TK? That or Yui x Hinata love story. ^ ^
can they just do that? just to please the fans? i want them to do. I need more of this anime.
IKR!!!!! I like it with kanade and otonaki as well though
Those manly tears running amok again... they caught me off-guard this once, but i'll work on keeping them at bay.
Lol
