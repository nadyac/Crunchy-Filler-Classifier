"Look, Princess. There's nature everywhere."
Why wouldn't he troll the enemy? He's about to pull off some Dynasty Warriors shit
I totally lost it there, man. Finally a character who doesn't give a crap about the other guy's monologue! Hak FTW!
It's a totally different style of anime but Hak really reminds me of Usui from Kaichou wa Maid-sama
Hime turned into a BAMF
Off to rewatch kaicho wa maido-sama... LOL I love that anime, thanks for reminding me of it! Usui for the win, and yes, Haku reminds me of him too!
Yona is becoming awesome! Can't wait to see her and her "fire" to develop into an epic battle princess!
The flaming red hair of justice!
@RX-0Unicorn so if Yona continues to have emotions and is not able to murder someone she loved deeply and who was also a dear friend of hers in cold blood, she will no longer be a badass despite any other accomplishments. Got it.
If red hair is some kind of outlawed trope, then someone change the constitution
@RX-0Unicorn she could go all kaneki rize and half kill him?
Empatsu shakugan no...Yona?
How many times does Hak have to show that he's a complete boss before he gets some loving?
Favorite scene - Fire soldier #1 (staring dumbfounded): "Amazing..." Soldier #2: "Don't stand around impressed! He's injured! After him!"
if you can get the enemy soliders dazeed by your awesomeness your a badass
I'm straight, and even I'm turned on by Hak.
I'd gladly give him the business hehe
As a straight man I can say that his pure unadulterated badass is so intense that I now get turned on a little by him
Summary: in this episode Yona becomes cool, but not as cool as Hak, because no one can be as cool as Hak.
really? I think she's cooler if only just because she is a weak princess and has the resolve to do that vs Hak who ridiculously strong already
@Rena-Ryuuguu I agree, I got shivers from her speech! I'm reading the manga: Yona has fantastic character growth! Already she went from caring only about hair and so-won, to pushing a guy off a cliff and standing up to her childhood enemy.
Hak is amazin' doe. Still love Hak more than Yona but hey, they're both swell ^ ^
@Rena-Ryuuguu that's one big difference - she's a princess with a title and the bloodline to back it up. He is physically powerful but a lowborn adopted tribe leader, different kinds of power.
I love this show. The way the character react to one another are fresh and not really of the more typical anime reactions. I especially like the way Hak and Yona interact.
I just wish the animation was a little more stylized and less generic to give it a bit more personality, though I do like how Yona looks
i vote this anime best character interaction anime of the season.
I totally agree! I love that half the time her responses to are practically verbal eyerolls instead of the typical tsundere/shocked/whiny princess trope.
I dunno, I think the animation kinda makes it a more nostalgic feel like the music and the poses.
I think the animation style is a very good interpretation of the original manga's style. The manga's art does have something to it that gives it a unique feel, but this is a good transition to animated full-color.
I'm waiting for that moment when she cuts her hair... I know it's gonna be on the those desperate, shocking moment with super intense background music
I thought the music thing was just my setup
it is your setup. if you have 5.1 surround like me (px51 and a creative x-fi card) it sound great. I just wish they could also add a 5.1 signale option for the hd anime instead of stereo.
I actually really like the music in this show if its a little loud thats fine with me...just makes everything seem more intense!!!!!
The studio majorly messed up. Its as if they didn't reference the mix to stereo and just bounced it listening to it in a surround set up. They messed up, you can't blame someones set up, most people use stereo systems.
If it's like how Sakura cuts her hair off in the chunin exams, I'm going to lol hardcore
I thought she was going to use the bow he left but that was so much better!
I was sure she was going to use it too. But that was definitely a better route to take. This show is getting so great.
I think it would have been Deux-ex machina if she did start using the bow. The king said it clearly in ep 1 that he was willing to give her everything but Soo-won and a weapon. So she has no training and unlikely to be able to shoot a bow.
Not to mention the fact that Yona has zero resolve to kill(or harm) as of this episode, even if she used the bow and could use it, she wouldn't have been able to fire the shot to even maim him.

Yeah I was expecting her to use the bow I'm glad she isn't yet though a bow isn't an easy weapon to use


But he's alive, though. XD
I'm really impressed by Princess Yona. She goes through so much trauma in such a short amount of time and yet somehow comes out stronger for it. I love this show so much!
It took five episodes, pain, heartache, sadness confusion & suffering but the Princess has finally gotten stronger and matured

even in real life when a lot of bad s*** happens people tend to mature were they may never have in their whole life before it happened.
It's Yona and Ange in a race for maturity. Only one can win the hand of her man, the other gets a yuri harem and a pervy comedy mechanic...
"And then the fire nation attacked."
Goddamit lol. I knew I would see that if I scrolled down enough.
Darn you FIRE NATION leave our girls alone already.
- Because their honor didn't hinge on the Hime's capture. *Mine* does! That coward's hundred years of hiding is over! - Once I deliver the Yona to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne.
Capital Fuuga was a peaceful place... Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

Yona-1 Hak-50 by default
"Hey Princess You gained weight" ...."That was unnecessary".... xD that really was unnecessary but soooo funny

Man, every other male character that is going to show up should just give up now. You can't upstage Hak, he already won.
Definitely an appropriate time to enjoy nature!
Yona is the best reverse harem's female MC


RAGE RAAAAAAGGGGGE those eyes had such emotion. I'm still in wonder how anime does that with eye twice the size of real people.
Don't underestimate the power of stares!
Fluttershy, you got some steep competition.
Finally a MC understands that as opposed to whining about being powerless and can't do it they should just pull their shit together and become a badass.
I love tihs show. I REALLY love this show. But every time I'm amped to my peak....The end credits roll. A show this good needs hour long episodes.
This is definitely one of the best shows this season.
