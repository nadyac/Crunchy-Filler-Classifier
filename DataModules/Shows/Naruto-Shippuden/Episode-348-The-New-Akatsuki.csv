So basically Danzo, in an attempt to destroy the Akatsuki, indirectly made them into a most-wanted terrorist organization with only Jounin-level or higher shinobis led by Madara
Exactly. A perfect example of Good Job Breaking It .... Hero(?)
and it's so sad and scary how people like Danzo exist in real life, and how they make us want to destroy other groups because they make us believe they are terrorists...
and I say it again. Im glad you died Danzo

Danzo was a major psychopath. He showed absolutely zero empathy and remorse for all the evil shit he did (he seemed to enjoy it sometimes too). In fact, his actions match most definitions of Psychopathy. So yeah, hes a major psychopath.
The story of Yahiko,Nagato and Konan is very cool,i liked these last episodes,and Obito too
These episodes remind me of how much of a dick Danzo was.
Too many "anzos in 1 episode lol
Kanzo was Danzo is disguise... duh.
Sasuke was did the world a favor by getting rid of Danzo.
dnwr- aside from the grammar, i totally agree with you.
whoa I didn't even notice till you pointed it out lol
if you make a spelling mistake you could fuck up the whole story
So glad Sasuke killed Danzo.
how to use guest passes?
me too i like seeing him beg for mercy
You know, for the first time, I actually appreciate Sasuke.
pretty sure danzo killed himself, ill have to go back and check though
I love your profile pic
I love how in Naruto, the writer makes U understand & possibly relate to the purpose of every villain. Not just the typical super villain that wants to kill everyone/control over the world, its so much more complicated and deeper than that.
@ SirBlackout3999 Oh please!
Every villain except Danzo, you mean. That guys a dick for no good reason at all.
Danzo was a troll. Konoha was in peace talks with Stone. He sabotaged that & Konoha's peaceful coexistence with Rain. In one move, he destroyed Rain's growing peace movement, made Konoha & Rain into enemies & ended peace talks with Stone.
At the same time, he said, "It's to protect the peaceful existence of Konoha. It's to protect Konoha from its enemies. It's for the sake of Konoha's future." All he did was create an atmosphere of perpetual war for Konoha. He was a troll.
it's like they're not even villains (most of them), something happened to them or someone did something to them that made them the way they are.
I bet kakashi was born with the mask...
No he was born with two masks ; remember " Under this mask... is another mask"
He derves his own anime.
I thought the same about L, too bad they killed him. It would have been awesome if he had his own anime/manga.
So what the show seems to say is every one has a purpose and backstory, except Danzo, he is just a jerk.

That Ending song, so beautiful!!
so true! I never skip it.
naw colsri423....this opening song isn't too bad. i'm actually dying to see it performed live. i bet they're so cute.
I feel like the opening theme song doesn't fit the theme of an entire world war that's going on.
I still like the opening, I would like if they did some minor changes within the opening, like they used to do with the first 4 openings.
Feel like cute just isn't the right words
We meet again Shippuden...
I haven't watched in forever, but wanted to see this and it turned out really good.
On to the Kakashi filler next week!
I like this side stories, I dont like the episodes that make no sense like the one where they are in a race with some random guy... lame I say
I don't think this is filler in the same way. It's rounding out the story and details that weren't even in the manga. We knew that Akatsuki was formed by the war orphans for the sake of peace, but these past few episodes have fleshed it out
Did you never wonder where all these characters came from when watching the earlier episodes of Naruto? Its amazing to have watched it when it was so simple and now we are learning about all the characters that play a huge role in the show!
@nahidul78694 lol i completely agree... the other fillers were rlly good, but that one filler was a disgrace to naruto. a sheer waste of 20 episodes. and then some of the war episodes that were filler were pretty bad
Kishimoto says he's deciding on revealing Kakashi's face sooner or later in the manga or a movie #Chieftaintauren
What if Naruto went through this? This backstory is awesome.
hmmm naruto gave in to the hate due to Pain, how is he different from nagato and obito. Besides not seeing for himself his love die(aka.sakura unlike obito who saw his best friend kill rin his love)He had someone to stop him..unlike others
It's not about how much pain they suffered. You can't compare pain really. It's about what they decided to do in response to that pain. Obito and Nagato decided to secretly and single-handedly remove pain from the world.
Naruto and Yahiko decided to understand their own pain, and unite with others in order to help everyone understand each other, with the idea that this understanding will motivate people to not want to cause pain to others.
Itachi, Jiraiya and Minato decided to sacrifice their lives in order to support future generations. They all chose the manner of their own deaths, and they each had a purpose in doing so.
amekoshi.. that was beautiful..
Wow, things PROBABLY could have worked out for the best if Obito hadn't gotten in the way. Nagato and Yahiko could have stopped and later questioned Hanzo and had a good discussion. Then Danzo would have been revealed and killed.
Both Obito and Danzo acted narcissistically and selfishly. They didn't start out that way, but they lost hope and became that way.
is it... over already??? MOAR
Right! You get so into it and then...BAM... the ending starts to play :/ What if Naruto had 30-40 minutes episodes
The series would be over by now if that was the case
Fuk you Danzo!!!
You know, much as I get annoyed with Sasuke, I will always be glad he executed Danzo. Danzo is the worst kind of pos there is.



its been the ice apocolypse down south lol
Is this the Straw hat crew hang out?!?!
I'm not part of your crew, show some respect to your older brother.
Here we go! It's been a hard week and now to finish it off with the best show ever! ^_^
Don't worry, folks! According to rumor, after the Kakashi arc is over, it will be cannon story all the way 'till the year's end.
thats what i heard besides a kakashi ambu arc, where it is shown everything from obito dieing to kakashi stabbing rin and everything in between, its going to be awesome, like a movie if you will
@Corelace: the manga did these flashbacks, too - so sorry, it'd be wrong if the anime didn't in this case. These flashbacks they are doing right now are important for the storyline's flow, to help you understand how everything got to here.
@ sitbfe-HAH that picture of a mannequin made me laugh.....notthing bad just was random is all
Not gonna lie. Hunterxhnter is preeetty badass, but I'm way too invested in Naruto by now to just say Hunter is best anime. Let's see how Naruto pans out first then we can figure out if Hunter can knock out One Piece.
I really hate you Danzo. Its a good thing you died. I wish you were never born in the first place. The ninja world would be a better place without you.
So true....
Good episode. At least, they gave us more answers on what drove them villians, etc. The New Akatsuki>>>The Old Akatsuki. Would love to see how Pain selects Kakuzu, Hidan, Oroc,Sasori, etc...we all already know about Itachi, Kisame, Deidara
495KMFKXDDY I personally enjoy this bit of back story
