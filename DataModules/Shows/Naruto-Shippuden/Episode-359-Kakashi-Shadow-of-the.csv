Time to go watch danzo die again.
I cant remember a single time that danzo told the truth...
@festy when he died and he said he was never able to catch up with saratobi and only was only able to live in his shadow.
Danzo became good... when he was about to die. Good job for relizing you've been doing shit before it's too late!
that tobi guy should've helped the uchiha clan with the cop detat instead of helping itachi killing them. How is his action justify that he was trying to Attain peace. ISn't he an uchiha? how can he kill his own people. That was his chance.
He wanted sharingan eyes, so this allowed him to further his plans. Also, he believed that once he achieved his goal he could bring them all back along with Rin, so he didn't mind if they all died. At least, that's how I saw it.
I have to say that this arc covered many unanswered questions.
Another reason to run Danzo over with a school bus TWICE

yep.. using byakugan on the ladies *fist pump*
Only Twice?
Fuck That 100 Times
I can understand that without Danzo the show would be less exiting but hes still a dick
The look on Kakashi's face when the 3rd made him a Jonin Leader HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Oh shit, next week we got to see Kakashi when he first started as a Jonin Leader! So much excite!
GTO mixed with Kakashi spin off! DO IT
I'm so totaly excited to see the grab my balls episode again. It will be nice to see it from kakashis eyes though.
But I guess this means that we don't resume the main story until next season. This has been a great filler period, but I do want to go back to the present-time story...
yea as enjoyable as This is i Think iT should of been a spin off like lee and his ninja pal

No more ANBU Kakashi. Too bad, He wears the look so well.
yeah ,my OPINION, i like more ANBU kakashi the ANBU itachi and ANBU yamato
Those uniforms are badass, it has "black ops" written all over them and that's awesome.
I was kind of hoping we'd get to see at least a passing reference to the first movie in here. It would have been cool to see him giving his report on rescuing the princess or something like that.
Uchiha Itachi, by far the best Anime character

I'm not sure how you're saying it's retconned. This all falls in line with the story as it's been presented so far, just fills in the details.
Nothing is retconned at all. Remember that this is filler and as such, never really happened. Although, to be honest I'm not sure what you're referring to.
There is nothing reconned here...all this has already been in canon.
It did con Danzo, how he didn't appear until shippuden.
Watching this make me want to shed more Manly tears for Itachi..
I'm actually grateful for this ep. We got to see the dynamics between Itachi and the Third, along with ANBU's perspective on the massacre. I thought the Sasuke/Naruto interactions before and after were a bit lacking, but at least addressed
Would those flashbacks happen to contain their own flashbacks?
Yes, flashbacks inside flashbacks inside flashbacks that were realy dreams inside flashbacks from naruto you watched on tv inside a room of mirrors.
you forgot that the flashbacks inside flashbacks inside flashbacks that were really dreams inside flashbacks on a tv inside a room of mirrors was also a flashback inside of Itachis 72 hour tsukiyomi... of more flashbacks
Yes the flashbacks within flashbacks within dreams were implied. Inception's got nothing on Naruto.
Well said..
Why would the Anbu have a sign on their headquarters that says "ANBU"? Aren't they a black ops team?
Draws away from the real headquarters bwahahahah
Well, theres anbu, and then theres root (which was supposed to be disbanded but apparently never did)
Oh Itachi, you will never be forgotten as a hero of the village. A hidden hero.
Wooooooo! Kakashi ANBU action! I love this arc!
No there are others also that are enjoying the arc, or enjoying the detail being added to this world to make it a more robust series instead of "HEY! there is a bad guy get him! YAY HERO WINS!!" every week.
You can count me in +1 to fans of Kakashi and Itachi fillers
I'm in the middle about this, we're WAY too far behind the manga to have fillers at this point in time. We should REALLY get back to the show, if they really want to do this, get rid of that Rock Lee spin off and make a show for this.
Hey the Rock Lee chibi spin off was hilarious
Rock lee was a good show plus it's over but I agree that enough is enough it's been 13 weeks of filler! I've enjoyed this filler but it's time to end it!
shouldve made hyuga the police force lol
Like the ending scene and song
even though danzos dead my hate for him just increases
Is it me or is this the final wrap up of the series. Closing all the lose ends for the final confrontation.
Wooo! Here's a guest pass! L5UQCNDT8VX Enjoy!
Man Danzo shitting all over the leaf and the shinobi world again... Lord third would have done better if he just would just chop Danzo's head off from the beginning! -_-
Your comment made me laugh so hard! I'm rather surprised Kakashi didn't try to warn Itachi about Danzo, considering all the crap he knows Danzo tried to pull.
"Allowed him to slip through undetected" , thats got to be an oxymoron...... Then how'd you detect him?
Let's Go Man!
FINALLY MY WEEK STARTS TO GET BETTER
Yes it did. The manga is so good right now.
[This comment has been removed]
*cough* Long live Madara *cough*
Yes the manga is really, really good right now. It's exactly what I hoping would happen.
