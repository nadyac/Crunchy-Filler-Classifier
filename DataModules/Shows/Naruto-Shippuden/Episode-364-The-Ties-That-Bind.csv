"I was hoping to take them down before they started with the speeches." Can we have more sardonic Madara please? That line just killed me.
in his life time, Madara heard almost all the shonen speeches there is to hear. Like Freeza in DBZ abridge.

still better than Dbz!
I do have to admit that Madara has some pretty awesome lines

For someone who almost never talks Hinata gets some EPIC speeches!!
she proved herself to be Naruto's rock! future rock too! go hinata!

@trolling Jade just no NarutoXHinata for life
Knew it. I knew they would finally be together..
"naruto kun's hand is big, strong..... but most of all comfortable" - Hinata I rewatched that part 4 times. This ep and its feels is........ (T_T) rivers of tears

yay
Team Hinata all day!
so no one is slightest bit saddened that neji died? or am I alone on this?
He lived for almost 600 episodes.. which is more than 20 times as long as the average anime character. I would be stricken if Hinata dies though. Cause she's cute. xD
crying my eyes out for Neji. X my heart I am.
Hinata you the real MVP
yeah that would suck if she doesn't.... she loved him before and still loves him just as much now.

The manga is complete bonkers. It went from Frieza to Majin Buu in a span of a chapter.
sorry buT happy endings for The heroes is whaT makes jump series jump series. i would never change ThaT. all you people who wanT naruTo To die need To go waTch anoTher series.

I was not prepared for this!
Noooo! I dont want my favorite person to die yet from the show!! I'll be depress all over again!!
yes. A real tear jerker this one.

Naruto went back on his word for the first time in his life :,(
ANYONE who's says Naruto is overrated and not a very good anime. EAT YOUR HEART OUT!!! Now excuse me while I go cry.
We need a Naruto Kai
I would totally purchase major anime "rebuilds" on disk. Where the filler wasn't removed, just placed early on and closer to it's proper chronology. Then I could watch the Main Plot Arc pieces back to back, unbroken.
I'd prefer a full remake of Naruto where they completely removed the filler and also fixed the dragging out of some scenes which wasn't technically filler but still lowered the quality. A well-edited edition of Naruto would be amazing.
I wanted to see Guy's expression at least. Neji may have been the most stubborn and reluctant of the trio, but those four really were like family.
Ecchi-Go glad im not the only one who thought that would be a good idea, i would so buy a blu ray rebuild of naruto that has everything in chronilogical order with maybe some of the cheesy action scenes re animated to look cooler
Well look who finally decided to show his face next episode...
Voldemort was due some screen time.


Naruhina are the OTP man. I need to read the manga to see if that gets anywhere. This is why I watch a lot of romantic drama anime's, because these shounen fighters never develop their love subtext, and it feels the pairings are wrong. >_<


pretty sure team Hinata just won right there.
I agree with You, MadameViper! ALL THE WAY!
TEAAAAAM HINAATTAAAAA WOOOOP! :''''') Felt so good about that last scene. There was something so correct about it.

its gonna be sasukura i think.....naruhina def ftw
Man it's been Hinata since always!!..I freakin wish we could've seen sakura's face when they held hands!!..SO cute!..I died!..she's always so strong for him!
Best episode in half a decade at least
All you ever see in anime is either "not enough action" or "too much action and no plot," no one will ever be satisfied completely with a anime. =_=
@gigafoot Replace "anime" with "life" and it's still true.

Well, I'd say hunter x hunter triumphs! ^^
great episode indeed! tomorrow's episode will have a lot more action haha just saying
Hinata be like "...and you know what they say about guys with big hands."
damn it, all the good lines were taken D:
They have acromegaly?
They have a small penis according to Sai?
Longer jutsu casting? Harder to mold chakara? thers no way it means huge weiners.......*cough

Why is it that every time something goes to hell, in the end Naruto is the only one being consoled. And of course like real battle, the enemies just wait with their rifles in their pockets enjoying some feels tea...

Duh, you can't have a war without tea breaks!
Hey Madara, pass the sugar. My tea has too many feels...
[This comment has been removed]
it is the first time in his first war that naruto saw one of his good friends died. If it were just a regular soldier he wouldn't lose his head but this is NEJI !!! So YES consolation is needed.
I can hear the NaruHina fans cheering in the distance lol.
Unfortunately. They are to loud.
That's actually cries of agony from NaruxSaku shippers, and those villagers whose village was wiped out by the ten tails. Wait, we didn't see them, where were they?
Wow.. this episode made me cry... and Hinata is absolutely perfect for Naruto

My mother is like Habanero, I prefer my more Hinata like wife
[This comment has been removed]

noooo.. sakura sucks she screws over naruto so many times. hinata is so much better
Hurry up Sasuke
no, just no lol i just hate that guy haha
3333i fuck off:PPPPP...I luv Sasuke!!!xDDD
Naruto if you don't get together with Hinata, i'll hunt you & kill you
too bad he still prefers sakura over hinata :/
Kushina would like Hinata for sure.
I still think the whole stalking thing was more creepy than cute, especially since said stalker can see through walls!

I need to go punch something to get my manliness back.... Im still in tears (q_q)

Rain also falls in Ninja-ville, it's what helps things grow.
