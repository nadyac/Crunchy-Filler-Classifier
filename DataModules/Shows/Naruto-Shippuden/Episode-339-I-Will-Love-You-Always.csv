It finally happened! Been waiting waiting for that, Itachis famous line to Sasuke
Be able to meet the people that acknowledged him.When e was shown in the original I liked him as the villain because he was so cunning, then he became creepy, and then his sad backstory, I honestly liked Kabuki from the beginning and still
No. The juts caster does not to be alive to deactivate Izanami. Kabuto just has to accept himself/his destiny for it to stop...
Jutsu*
Itachi should have been given a better ending Nagato should have brought him back along with all the other Konoha shinobi
so kabuto was forced to become bad guy? and he accepted his destiny for it to stop?!
Itachi is dead and still kick more ass than 99%of the rest of the ninja. They should be ashamed lol
Itachi, you're amazing!


RIP Itachi...
it's itachi sooooooooo
dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry
Kishimoto Style - Infinite Onion Jutsu!!

@Jldjello More like plenty of non-filler info, based on the manga.

@d3v3l yeah... i mean.. would you rather fight someone who can summon trees... or someone who can teleport @_@

Ya, i can really relate to fracticide
i couldn't take it, tears and pain but his parents accepting it, just to much feels

Well, cool guy, sure. Think badass goes to Madara though.
Itachi Best Anime Character in Anime History T_T
even the manga writers said that itachi in his prime could have rivaled madara. if he didnt have to use shushis eye to undo the reanimation...... also madara fused himself with the 1st so hes kinda cheating lol
@deathalive. Kishimoto (i.e. the writer) actually said no single shinobi can rival the resurrected Madara. He said Madara has not weak points. You will need many armies to overwhelm him.
@deathalive Um, no. He didn't say that. If you think he did, might want to provide some sources for that claim.
I hope this comes true
I'd buy it.
I would commit the same deed Itachi was forced to do in order for this OVA.

I think Kishimoto said once that he wanted to draw Itachi's story in similar way he drew Kakashi Gaiden
& Once Again, Itachi Breaks My Heart & Leaves Me All Alone... My Heart Hurts.
Why Did You Start Every Word With A Capital Letter?
Itachi saved the leaf village before Naruto and now saved the world before Naruto
ITACHIII (*/_\*) .... DON'T GO
That is so his face --> (*/_\*). Whoever thought of this is genius.
Official Itachi smiley! XD Yay. I'm going to use (-/_\-) in place of (-_-) when people txt me dumb questions/statements from now on.
haha!
itachi with sharigun (*/_\*)
sharingan, sorry but that mistake bugs me
If Madara could do that just imagine what the Great Sage had up his sleeves (o_0)!
cant wait!
why cant i hold all these feels? D:
That is why I've always hated Danzo
I actually really liked Danzo. To me, he was just...a pretty cool old guy. He may have had some wrong ideas, but still, pretty smart.
He wanted to protect the village the best way he though he could, but due to his ways (and because things didn't go entirely as he wanted) it backfired badly.
he deluded himself into thinking that his way was the right way, he really just wanted to do his part to protect the village... but, like many others, his methods were wrong.
Danzo forced kids to join his shittty foundation and then forced them to kill each other 1 by 1 he's the biggest douchbag in naruto that's why he got killed by sasuke 10 times over
Danzo only ever cared about the leaf, don't be hatin
Itachi, The best character in the show just left. (cries)
Then everything up til the part when he returns wouldn't really make the slightest sense.
itachi shippuden
Order of best character: Itachi, Minato, and Naruto
Weasel Wonderland.
i have to say its minato then itachi then naruto just because minato took on tobi and the nine tails while protecting naruto
Its time for a feels trip (*/_\*)
I don't know why, but that emoticon reminds me of Itachi. (*/_\*)

Screw Izanagi and Izanami, Susano'o is the really Ultimate Uchiha jutsu!
hashirama
Hashirama was the only man able to stand against the perfect Susano. Luckily Madara is the only user. If it became know like the Izanami, the world would have crumbled simply from Uchiha fighting themselves.
Yeah until another arc, when a new endboss would be introduced and Naruto and everyone else have their powers reset to 0. You know cuz that's just how the author rolls.


RIP Itachi
Dude, he was practically already dead, so it becaomes Rest In Peace Again (RIPA)
Itachi......... noooooooooooo
those feels, it hurts.
There should not be this level of feels at 4 am in the morning. I need to go kill a bear with my bare hands or something...
Or just act like Kamina for the rest of the day.
KAMINA ANIKI! Don't make me remember those feels. God. (You do mean the Gurren Lagann one, right?) Also, to get your man-card back, Wayne, watch Legends of the Dark King, prequel series to Fist of the North Star. Auto Man-card regeneration!
Damn it who started cutting onions in here
Damn those onion-slicing ninjas!
Imagine knuckle from hxh watching this, he would be crying more than any of us. Remember if he can cry and still be a manso can you (or woman/girl/boy as the case may be)
Screw this!! 26 years of age and now i'm a grown man reduced to tears in a matter of seconds!! Screw you Itachi.. your an awesome character but you can't go saying that kinda stuff then leave!! :'(
