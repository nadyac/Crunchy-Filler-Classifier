TK IS A CONFIRMED GANGSTA
@WrittenShallow this is how us English-speaking people must sound when we say random Japanese words
Ok.... the rest of his memory was extremely tear-jerking.
I couldn't cry, because it was more inspiring than tear-jerking in my opinion (no offense everyone) I mean how he became a donar at his last moments was beautiful, and how he died right before they were saved is indeed horrible.
I agree with Biggle here. I was just in awe on how he stayed strong till the very end and gave up his life to save everyone else that was stuck in the tunnel. He died a hero.
I find that stuff like that is closer to tear-jerking for me than sad stories. So I agree with all of you.

5 more minutes. c'mon. ( he still probably would've died though).
manly tears were shed today T_T


fuuuuu!! true way to make men cry!

manly tears were indeed shed today and i hope in spite of the deaths i hope we all start donating organs
i have the sudden urge to share a kidney
Been an organ donor since I first got my license. I think being an organ donor is one of the greatest gifts a person can give.
Sign you're donor card!
My sister is giving me one of her kidneys in just two days... this ep really tore my heart up.
if this episode tore your heart up, then you're gunna need someone to donate a heart too.
Died
This is such a great show. First time I ever saw a scene that was so sad it made me cry, and yet so inspiring and heartfelt at the same time.
It's kind of funny how literally every character is kinda dumb in some small aspect. I mean that in the most endearing way possible.
As stated multiple times throughout the series by the small pink haired girl, everybody is a moron.
Yui
Maybe she's the smart one! 0.0.
There are no exceptions to the Moron Rule. "Everyone is a moron."
If they ever dubbed this, would they make TK speak japanese?
no he will speak spanish.
This has been dubbed. TK speaks like the characters from Wayne's World.



oh man after his T_T story I don't think there would be any better story in the series....now to next episode with a napkin on the side
omg.. what an amazing episode.. tears
beyond words how wonderful this anime is.............simply a work of art
all anime is art
Abunai Sisters called to prove you wrong.

The radio mentioned becoming an organ donor today; I haven't seen this show in almost 2 years but when I heard that, I remembered this episode and became overwhelmed with feels. I'm not a crier, but I had tears in my eyes re-watching this.
what a hero
man... this anime runs deep...
This was a really emotional episode..
I'm so sad for Otonashi dying there T-T
How many other people love Naoi He is sooo cute ^^
He isn't cute. He's kawaii ^-^
Not gonna cry...not gonna cry...*cries alot* ;-;
wow.. ive seen my share of dramatic anime. even romance stuff. and none of those shows really hit the feels. but for some reason that scene when he starts to circle the option for being a donor right before his death just did it for me.
That was when the tears appeared for me! :'(
