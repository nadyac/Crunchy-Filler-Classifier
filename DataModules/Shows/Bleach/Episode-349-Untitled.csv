don't think Im gonna like this arc too much... I miss Zangetsu too much and using the combat pass as a weapon is kinda derp... hope they improve it.
so combat pass has tooo many memories etch into it... and its too many to count... really? i thought ichigo didn't get his combat pass after he learn bankai
its the memory from his powers not when he physically got the combat pass, the combat pass just represents his powers
Well, since they're talking about OBJECT'S souls, I would think they're refering to the ACTUAL combat pass. It's normal to screw up, even if it's in mildly important things like that.
the pass would have in it the firsthand experiences of his battles after he was given it, but in every subsequent battle is the pride of each previous battle not contained?
