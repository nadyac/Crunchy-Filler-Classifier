Niceeeeeee
And I CANNOT WAIT. XD
I would worry if my body was left with that nurse for 4 to 5 hours -_-
In the future the government is going to create SAO. Srsly. And, I feel like the pretty nurse is going to have sex with Kirito. -_-
lol

That nurse is.... unprofessional. I'm torn between, "Hey! My health is at issue here!" and "Hey, let's play doctor." *sigh* What to do. What to do...
Let's all remember season 2 is based 10 years in the future (2025) laws can change.
His body is ready!
@Jadeakl No, she'd better be a PLANT DECORATION in the corner when Asuna's there XD
I have some ideas of what she's gonna do with his body while he's gone... Play world of War craft of course!

Yeah I figured it was Kirito as besides being female and having long hair it looks just like him. And I doubt Asuna will have to small of a role in this series for one thing you have to remember they consider themselves married.
That information Darkwater got is from the Light Novel of GGO
I'm one of those who thought parts of SAO were rushed.
In the light novel, it takes forever for him to get there. I'm impressed it was only three episodes here.
Link Start triggered some old memories the feels bro the feels, Happy feels though :')

the reason you think that is because of the subliminal picturing in the opening, shinkawa's picture of him smiling is put right after death gun's, so it's a logical assumption, but it's usually not that easy...

In the opening credits he is standing in front of Sinon. Then his image is replaced by Death Gun.




I think she should have just let her mother die, or maybe herself so that all you pacifists would be happy that a little girl didn't fight back.





@heven93: Because that's a common plot device?
[This comment has been removed]
@heven93 because of the intro? That's my reason.
Shino has really messed up past. the funniest part was the nurse she went straight for the ass Kirito u better hope she does nothing while ur GGO.
The first season moved so fast that watching this one makes it feel really slow. But I am liking this character development, its a whole lot better than Kirito meeting someone ONCE and expecting us to care about them.
I think the plot and character development is ten times better than the first season.

The GGO arc is a lot darker than the the first two.
Well, in SAO PvP wasn't the main focus of the death game. Laughing Coffin members only showed up in two episodes. From the very first episode, we learn that "Death Gun" has managed to turn GGO into his own private murder paradise.
Not to mention they cut out a big part of the Laughing Coffin story in the first season.
too true.. this isnt about a group of killers.. this is about a classic sicko/serial killer
The word i wanted to here again, LINK START!
"LINK START" YES!!
Sinon was taught from a young age to always aim high, and (head) high she did! (I'm sorry, I'll walk away now...)
I'm still waiting for someone to take an arrow in the knee...
Too soon, man, too soon...
We went to a traumatic backstory to a perverted nurse in half an episode. Only in SAO...
Sounds Like Black Bullet all over again....
"He wants you to join his ever growing little girl harem"
So let me get this straight. People were complaining that season 1 had no character development and was all action. Now that season 2 is trying to fix that, people are complaining that there's no action!? You guys are a bunch of hypocrites.
People ganna bitch and moan no matter what happens, who makes it, what it is to begin with and anything else that makes up the components of a "thing". The ratio of Derps to sane people is a minimum of 3/1 at any given time.....
^^^ MatthewGade said it best.
I'm just glad that there's a single female character that hasn't instantly fallen in love with Kirito... But it is only the third episode.
I honestly thought there was too much melodrama without any real character development in the SAO arc that it dragged from 8-14. It feels like they've tuned the mix to perfection for the GGO arc.
you have to find a balance of the two

Just how useless were those adults? As soon as he was distracted with the bite you think someone would jump in. Certainly after the first shot when he was down you'd think someone would have sat on him. It's like they're more scared of her.
If I remember correctly, her mother was already depressed from her father's death and even going out was a challenge for her. The incident only served to push her over the edge.
Fear? More like horrified at what she had done.
An useful examination of psychology that helps explain the reactions of the surrounding adults may be found by googling "Mark of Cain syndrome" with Massad Ayoob as author. As a long time peace officer he offers good insight on the subject
Sinon, instead of playing GGO, she should have gone to see a psychologist. just saying.
Honestly was not expecting this kind of episode from Sword Art Online. But hell yeah! Gotta love this style of pacing, suspense, and character development, I guess this really is the totally new and improved SAO2... color me impressed!
Although honestly, I liked the plot for SAO I more, but they definitely rushed things.. Suppose it's time to read about it:D
Dat nurse, dat everything, dat embarrassed look on Kirito's face XD
So far they've done a great job with this season. Everything is exactly how I imagined it while reading the novels. Looks like they're keeping a decent amount of internal monologue too which is a plus.
If they put in Mother's Rosario, Keep the kleenex (tissue) box within reach.
Mother's Rosario *wrecked* me. Finished it a few days ago. Literal tears streaming down my face. And that was just from reading it. Seeing it animated is going to give me emotional trauma.
All in all; 3 episodes in, A-1 Pictures did a good job. Comparing the Light Novels, it seems that they're covering 1 Chapter per episode. If that's the case, then Mother's Rosario's ought to be in for Fall 2014.
I concur! It HAS been wondrous!
I have not read the light novels yet, but with the way the show is progressing, I'd say it's a definite improvement from the first season. I hope they don't rush it like the first season
Great now I have to wait another week.
She to sessy for u?^:(
@Space-Kittie, Character development for the main character not worth it? Maybe character development of any sort is too much for you? You'd rather have an entire series of mindless action & fanservice with no purpose? Enthralling!!

The mother's face though, the heck. The daughter just saved her lifes and other people, no need to give her that "you just killed someone" look, at her. Dont be weakened by that shinon, and keep moving forward.
I'm inclined to think it was shock of the moment more than shock over what her kid did. Seriously, if you're in an emotionally charged situation like that, logic is the last thing to run through your mind.
THAT NURSE IS CREEPY! SOOOOOOOOO WIERD!

i think death gun is the post office robbers son .... o.o



I feel like it's the guy who's trying to get Kirito to investigate Death Gun, that way he'll know if someone's after him, and it'll keep Kirito distracted if anything else comes up...
