Want me to lock the door? LMFAO! serious mood turned to a joke that was awesome!
I choked there xD
I wouldn't say it ruined the moment. Sudden shifts in mood or tone is one of anime's strong points. That's one of the things I appreciate about this medium.
^That's what's so great about Arakawa-sensei, she's so great at tugging at those heartstrings one moment then demolishing the glacier sized ice that she herself created with a truly epic sucker punch of a punchline, just like in FMA
Dick, just lock it if you think you have to ask.
That made me laugh XD
"I have a dream..." *ends episode* NOOO I wanted to hear her go Martin Luther King Jr. on them!
@xxJing I think you forgot, but chapter 68 ends with her saying I have a dream of my own. So it ends with the same cliffhanger.
The last guy to have a dream got shot, we have "goals" now.
She wants to become the number one courtesan in the Edo?
^ :/
"Don't underestimate idiots!" Not surprised to hear that those words came from Tokiwa.
actually, if you wanted to be frugal, you could burn the dried cow patties for heat...once it's dried, it shouldn't have any smell. or so i've read....
Sounds like internet trolls trying to get people to burn poo and smell it
Working on a farm, yes cow patties don't smell once they have dried and hardened but if you break them open or burn them, they do smell...A lot.
@wainsocott. If i remember correctly they smell worse after you break them when its dry. I used to help out at my granparents farm.
I got used to shit smell long time ago, so it doesn't bother me on my farm. But i will say i got some cows from a place that feed them leftover unions. I will say that was the worst smell i have found. Cow shit , mixed with rotting onions.
They were holding hands on their walk back home. They were holding hands on their walk back home! THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS ON THEIR WAY BACK HOME!
I was just still laughing about the door when i saw them holding hands it made it ten times worse
I like the whole episode... and obviously that "want me to locked the door" was funny. If would've been funnier if it was torikawa (the idiot) opening the door
This whole episode left me -FistsRaisedInUltimateVictory-
Hachiken earned the right to hold her hand.
torikawa wouldve made it worse, he has no sense of things...

Silver Spoon, you can't trick me, putting the ending 5 minutes early. Do you take me for some kind of casual?
Just who the hell do you think I am!
Well.....why would you stop watching the ep when the ED starts? That's one of the biggest mistakes many Anime viewers make. Not to mention, this ED's is one of the best out there, so even stupider to stop it.
That was cool when Hachiken learned his new jutsu and used it to get the dragonball
Who'd skip this awesome ED?!?
My drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens!!
why isn't this show more popular?
It's too real.
This show is awesome sauce with bacon and cheese!!
@jeffrus you forgot eggs, rice and veggies. "part of a good balanced breakfast"
The manga is extremely popular. What makes you think it isn't?
^ That it's ranked 40 on the popular show list here at CR...
Hachiken really is the man. Best protagonist I can remember seeing in an anime for a long time. He and Mikage will make a great couple.
It's been a good 17 years since I last worked as a farmer and this episode just tore me up seeing the cows getting loaded up and then the empty barn later on along with everything else that went on in this episode.
At the beginning when Hachiken and Mikage are having their emotional conversation, I couldn't help but laugh because I kept looking at Maron's smug face in the background.
Instead it was Yoda-senpai. DAMN YOU YODA!
Maron - "Get a stable you two"
Well, you have stopped me from commenting outside of replies. Same here! He just looked so epic there. =w=
lock the door you must ~Yoda~
hachiken was totally thinking farmers daughter romp in the hay... country music classic lol

If they (or her grandpa) were plotting something like that I think they would have been more teasing about it. Looked like serious business to me. And horses are a rather expensive hobby. My mother's love of horses taught me that.
Shame they don't have a yacht to sell - those things are a REALLY expensive hobby!
I also think they were being serious, but her dad knew exactly what was going on with her AND with Hachiken being there. I love Mr. Mikage, you can tell beneath all his roughness he loves Aki to the sky and back, and kinda respects Hachiken
@Netcoyote I agree with you... I think her grandpa did that on purpose.
lol mikage san can sense a hackiken in his daughters future...


He probably knows and understands her more than she realizes. But he doesn't seem the type to speak for someone else, he wanted her to speak for herself.
Mikage needs a hug.
His dad seems like a successful businessman, and he has enough money to send one kid to Tokyo U, and the other to an agricultural boarding school (and presumably college afterwards). I actually think Hachi's family is well off.
True. Forgot Aki lives in the dorms too. As far as his old man helping... what successful businessman would lend a stranger money without collateral or a cosigner? Who would cosign on that loan considering that's the root of the problem.
I can't help but think that Hackhiken will use his training in economics and his Dad to work some sort of deal to Co-op the two farms into something more profitable... Maybe he'll tell his dad he wants to be a farmer and buy them both?
interesting theories
read the manga
Hachiken and Mikage make a great team. Though Hachiken would be good with anyone, but it just has to be Mikage.
Man, even the dog thought this episode was depressing.
Comes to show how fast a dream can end, this is quite depressing :l
You absolutely have to watch after the credits, if you don't, you will miss all the FEELS!
I wouldn't say all of them, but I didn't cry untill after the credits.
One shall never skip the ED's. Makes me sad to see all of these "watch after the credits" comment. T^T Still happy people are actually warning others about it.
almost never watch openings or endings and i crunch entire series in a day, i actually get angry when i catch up with a series... i hate waiting for episodes, especially with all the anime that have non endings, ie harems and most romcoms..
Oh god seeing the twins cry made me wanna cry. Loli tears are the worst!
Time to see Hachiken stand up for himself. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
