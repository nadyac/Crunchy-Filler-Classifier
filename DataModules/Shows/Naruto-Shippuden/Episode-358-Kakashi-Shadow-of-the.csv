He clearly isn't dead

I love how they just rip eyeballs out like they are cutting their fingernails
in the opening song, whose hands holding each other's? Im thinking hinata n naruto . why did cry?

And another reason to hate Danzo >.<
I was just about to post the same comment. God -.- so much hate!!!!!!!
Danzo is too weak and he bring hidden leaf down with him. shisui and itachi are both so shrewd, and they represent the power and potential of Uchiha. Danzo hindered the growth of hidden leaf by a huge extent for being so harsh on Uchiha
I Know His Such An Asshole Im So Happy He Got Raped By Sasuke
The two old advisors were the Third's teammates back when he was just a Genin. Just like Danzo, they're ninjas who've been serving Konoha ever since the Second Hokage. The only two of that generation still alive, in fact.
can we just call these anbu black ops episodes "Douche bag Danzo episodes" ? coz that's all im seeing
Damn trading eyeballs seems so easy. Guys I'll trade my left brown coloured eye for a green one pls.
Medical science hasn't come up with a way to transplant whole eyes yet, unfortunately... right?
no, you would have to reestablish the optic nerve, plus hope that the axons from the foreign eye would regrow in the correct alignment, given that there are neurotropic factors around to mediate its growth, which is unlikely in adults...
Listen. I don't want to read in the news that some kids went blind cause they thought they could trade eyeballs with each other. So, PLEASE, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. These are fictional characters trading fictional eyeballs with each other.
Sure I will give you my sharigan and my blue contact lens plus my black eye
I have green eyes.. but yeah I might do it, depends if I like your specific brown eye or not
Ok seriously wtf, Danzo is just stealing Uchiha's Sharingan willy nilly. how could that possibly help the village, Danzo is hands down the biggest dick in anime.
That eye's power takes a while before it's ready to use again. Sasuke had lucked out.
he used it on white zetsu at the 5 kage summit and it wasn't ready wen he battled saskue
Griffith from Berserk is a bigger dick
Danzo wasnt about tht life thts why he had to go! tht jerk.....
How it could possibly help the village? What, you don't think being able to manipulate anybody you want without them noticing could have come in handy for someone like Danzo?
Shisui and Itachi </3 My two favorite Uchihas.
@rx3 shisui nvr got a mangekyo... if u say it kuz of the genjustsu power that is just an ability of his eyes, as we know diff eyes have diff abilities. now if u say it kuz of the scene in this episode the mangekyo is itachi's eyes changing
it's just an intense emotional experience. I think mangekyo is a little like super saiyen activation...
The Mangekyo activates when the user feels and extreme amount of emotional distress, personally I believe it's guilt that causes it to activate. I assume that Itachi felt guilty that he let Shisui commit suicide. Sasuke felt guilty
@sirshanksalot its bought on by intense emotion. Itachi had initially said to Sasuke, come to me with the same eyes. There was mention that he needs to watch his closest friend die but they haven't really touched on Shisui too much
ever noticed how Shisui was alaways alone like with none of his family...lets talk about tht xD
@Darkprinc979 You hit the nail on the head.
The sympathy for Itachi reached 9000 when he died and the truth was reveiled. As for Danzo I hope Lord Enma tortures him for eternity.
The sasuke vs danzo fight is episode 209, if you feel an urge to see danzo destroyed again. Those were the days, back when sasuke was a badass.
@Hatoriku TY
lol i will >:u
Im really diggin all the clarification. it really exposes the depth of that last battle that was going on
The manga is ending soon. This might be the last filler arc. I don't mind if it drags on a bit more. Especially since this has probably been the best filler arc in all of Naruto.
@xemnas what makes u think that it will b ending soon? for all we know there might b an expansion of this kind of like a sequel of a good movie which ends up destroying all of its legacy kuz it was just that bad lol
Reminds me of Dragonball evolution... the closest thing to almost kill goku permanently lol
The best filler arc was when Lee was racing with his hands and eating the curry of life. not serious.

i really liked how itachis mom came to see naruto in the hospital found it pretty cool how she was friends with kushina
Revealed in the back-story of Kushina Uzumaki.
There is a bit of a problem with it though. How does she know which one is Kushina's? She wasn't there for the birth, and the whole thing was top secret.
pretty sure she knew Minato had that golden/blonde hair
Naruto was in battlefield after the attack of the 9 tails alone as his parents died.Leading to everyone else would know.
People knew about Naruto, hints why he was given a hard time in his younger years. The third was there when Naruto's mom died, so he was never left alone.
F~~~ you Danzo! Boggles my mind how he lived for so long!
i hate Danzo also but, looks like the 3rd and Danzo are two sides to the same person, Danzo does the dirty work they 3rd cant bring him self to do but wants to do.
I am inclined to agree with you Nbu01, Thats why they both have their own ANBU forces. Danzo is one evil sob but he gets shit done that Hiruzen Sarutobi doesn't have the guts to do.
Bad times don't last, but bad guys do. I always think of that quote whenever Danzo is mentioned.
I'll give it to danzo that some hard stuff had to be done, BUT there is no denying that orochimaru and his greedy ass were in it for themselves and using the village as an excuse. Danzo had sharingan BEFORE the uchiha died think about it.
i think he saved all the eyes from the Uchina clan died because in one episode he has them all over him...or was tht someone else?? @.@
So next week we're gonna see Obito show up and talk with Itachi?
god this clears so much shit up
like what? I didn't get much
You had to have read the back-story of Itachi to really get it.
Yes you most certainly have needed to understand the history of the Uchiha and it's members involvement with Konoha to understand this epi
Such as, how Itachi's mangekyo sharingan awoke and what the Uchiha's lives were like after the kyuubi attack. Also, how Shisui died, etc. etc.
Not clear how Tobi was the person behind the Nine Tails incident - fought Yondaime? - while it's clear Kakashi was still young that time and therefore relatively Obito as well. Sucks.
The third Hokage really pisses me off. How he just lets Danzo walk all over him all the time and How he just let Orochimaru go after he murdered many people(He even had suspicions long before he actually found out). Blood is on his hands.

Kakashi would be a good Hokage! Can do the dirty work and still has a peace of mind that will create peace.
Yeah, too bad he's not interested. To be honest, someone who isn't actively after the job is just one more point in their favor. It means they aren't power hungry in the least.
@10tailedkillabeast, 100% agreed with you about how the 3rd lets Danzo walk all over him especially he tried to assassinate the 3rd. I think the reason why he gets away with it because of the two idiots council listen to Danzo....
You're kind of right but remember he said he owed him one when Danzo let Kinoe/Tenzo/Yamato free. Hes the type to feel guilty he got Hokage title over his friend, plus half the time hes outvoted by his counselors. Itachi kept Danzo in check
Always a good EP with itachi
there should be a danzo death flashback on every episode. like from every angle slow mo alternate deaths for one a bloodier one would be awesome
Bring back the shorts on the ends of the episodes and put it there. Have a different character kill him every episode, starting with Gai. It would be amazing.
i would pay for tht ! <3
what a boss episode
Agreed! I like how they finally explained where the Uchiha clan was during the 9 tails attack.
man i love itachi no homo! also shisui is awesome i was hoping for a bit more back story on him
I do wish we could seem ore of Shisui. Barely know the poor guy and he was so important
He's the main character in the new Naruto video game coming out later this year.
Sarutobi is just as bad as Danzo, since he allowed Danzo to do all that stuff.. And why didn't Itachi snitch on Danzo>?!!!
Because Itachi understands Danzo. Danzo is not EVIL like people are making him out to be. He's simply acting in the leaf's best interest. Danzo is an anachronism from the dark age of shinobi history.
Personally i think during the time Itachi spent with Kakashi, during their ANBU days really shaped his life to be one of the good guys till the end, if not i think he would've kept following Danzo to the depths of hell.
Watch out, here comes the danzo hates.
I really miss the Main Story now!
I always have
what? theres a war going on in the present time?
eh I think this really adds to it, now when we see Naruto telling the bad guys off you'll appreciate his determination and an optimism knowing how fucked up the history of Konoha and the ninja world was.
@petaltoad Except that they're making all this stuff up. None of it actually happened. We already knew it was messed up from the stuff that ACTUALLY happened, and we'd know even MORE if they're just tell the fucking story.
If they showed backstory on everything right away, Naruto would move too slowly. It's much more interesting to leave a few holes and then expound on them when they become relevant.
