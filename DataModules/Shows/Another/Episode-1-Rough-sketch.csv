the main characters... they all have the same seat... the back-left next to the window...
I want to see an anime that has the main character sit in the right front seat in the classroom just to be unique,
I just realize why Ryu from Kimi ni Todoke wanted his seat at the back by the window so badly. It wasn't just that he got it in the draw, he probably secretly wanted to be the main character. Ah, but he was my favourite character regardless
anime cliches
Daijobu...
Well it is cheaper and easier to draw rather than drawing the entire class each time they want to focus on MC.
I love it how the tab says Watch Another Episode
I don't ride in elevators because of this anime.

Guga
my grandma was rushed to the hospital while watching this anime...
I would love for that to happen. I know its super strange to say and hear but hasn't anyone else ever wondered what it would be like to see a ghost? what do they do? why are they here? I cant say I believe in ghost because I never seen one.
I've seen a ghost, but in my case it was just an old man reading. No grudges or anything.
My dad saw me watching this and said "Oh no it's that Japanese sex stuff again."
Hyun, that was a spelling mistake and not a grammar mistake.
Japaese sex stuff? wait, what?! Please tell me there is NOT any hentai!!! I dont wanna watch that kind of stuff!!!
I'm lucky I guess. My 72 year old Mom loves anime!
My 70 year old mom does as well! I got her hooked on Ranma 1/2 many years ago.
Haha what he saw Watching any "Kojou moment" in Strike The Blood?
Note: Definitely not a good anime to watch at night.
I ain't afraid of no ghost.
I'm doing it anyways, and none of you can stop me! I mean, it's not like I was planning on sleeping that much anyway.
I had that realization after just seeing the first couple of minutes
gosh darn it! it's freaking 1 Am and I'm watching it. Though it's not very scary.
dang it.. it is 3:15 and I am done with the first episode... I hope I have a nightmare tonight.
I watched this with a friend, and now when we see each other were like "Sa-Ka-Ki-Ba-Ra-Kun" Like retards ^^
I LOLed so freaking hard at that comment
lolz why the first time u say anime people think porn ugh
I know, it pisses me off too. We had to change our club name because people associated it with Hentai.
Yep, this was a great series to pick up at 3:40am while I'm sick and home alone.
it scared the flu outta u? thank the creators they cured u with a horror ^_^
I tend to watch stuff like this late at night as well. XD Even though I hate getting freaked out and tend to get panic attacks very easily. (_ _|||)
if i was him i woulda packed my stuff and went back to tokyo lol
Let's find a new anime to watch I told myself, this one looks good I told myself, click on the link I did, watched the entire episode before bed I did.... Sleep no more I will.... Enough joking around, really good anime! Very compelling!
The number four means death in japanese. Thjerefore, they avoid to have a 4th floor or doors with the number 4 in it. It's like our unlucky 13

Laughing because I was born on Friday the 13th. (May 13, 1994; check if you wanna.)
But I only have good dreams on the 4TH day of each month. No other day. So I'm gonna ignore that.
Four is sometimes pronounced shi which also means death and it's the same in chinese, 4 = si(pronounced -suh-) and si can also mean death. -_-
i like how anyone on CR says anything that isnt positive or in agreement and just massive downvotes reign in. its hilarious. like, the most positive userbase on the interwebs
Why am I watching this?! I know i can't handle stuff like this D:
People keep comparing this to Dusk Maiden, but I think it feels more like HIgurashi.
Another is NOTHING like Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. They're so different and so good in their own ways.
Oh no. Please, god, don't let this be like Higurashi.
I saw the opening and though it was to scary.... :c
my emo senses are on high alert!
am I the only one who ain't scared??
what's with the introduction,,,,,,it's really creepy!!
Keep watching, hur hur
That intro was awesome!!
hah, I like this already! I hate the pre-post music. Doesn't fit the feeling of the anime at all. However, I could be missing something. BTW, if anyone is wondering why there is no 4th story in the hospital, it's because 4 means death.
I hate the inbetween random scary pictures- it's freaking scary ><
Should I watch this at night? I only watched the part before the intro song and I'm already scared......T_T
I love how the building doesn't have a fourth floor. Who needs a fourth floor anyhow? Skip 4 and you get 1 extra floor out of it. Megabonus
The number 4 is considered unlucky in japan because one of the readings for the number 4 is is a homonym with the japanese word for death. So in older buildings they often skip the fourth floor like people in the west skip the number 13.
I read somewhere that 9th floors also, sometimes mind you, don't exist.
I was wondering the same thing!
1st mistake: started unknown anime while alone in the dark with no one else home. 2nd mistake: That unknown anime turns out to be this one with a creepy vibe and a tremendous sense of "why do i feel like someone is standing behind me...?"
Watching at 11 at night same situation. I'm supposed to sleep after this, damn.
Im home alone watching this in my room in the dark. I made a stupid mistake.
Friggin adds suck!
