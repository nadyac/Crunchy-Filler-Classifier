I feel sooo sorry for Erec! But I really like his character, hes always so honorable and its always funny when Kon pwns him
hahaha who noticed that eric keep loocking down at Kon's wood hahaha he just didnt stop lol
Haha he talked about Goku loll
OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!

Such a weirdo walking around with his pecker in his hand.

lol this show kills me..when he grabbed that broom i thought he was gonna hit him in his last frontier
I just figured out the closing theme, ED as erectile dysfunction?
haha nice one!!!
Yes, yes it is XD i found it very funny as well XD
Kon pretty much sums it up I can't even laugh...
did anyone see the rock at the end?
22:38 my player froze at that exact time for no reason and I saw the penis...lool
C'mon, didn't any of you think "erectile dysfunction" when ED was introduced?
"Why is Kon glowing? It's probably the mysterious power of Alma (LOL)" I love that!! XD
16:04 rock with penis
Yes the mountains are penis's too, the light bulb in Kons room is a boob, and many of the building look like giant mushrooms. "Rock with penis" is not all that exciting.
Haha!! I feel so sorry for Erec....-snickers- Poor Guy even the Gods can't help him.

and on the left as well. ..good gracious, this anime... XD;;;
does the DT stand for virgin and ED at the end stand for erectile dysfunction, hence EREC.. lol
His full name is like Erecplye also.
yeah, DT = doutei, is slang for a male virign. lol

Did Kon not catch the part about increasing libido? lol
Poor Erec .. -_-
