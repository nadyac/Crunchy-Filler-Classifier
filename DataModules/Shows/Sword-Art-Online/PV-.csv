Every time I hear Kirito, I now think of Aito, damn it lol
He also was Sora from NGNL, but very different in character there.....
Sword Art Online II - Quest for Pantsu

I hear Titus from Magi.

THIS SUCKS I will be on a 14 hour flight to England when this comes out GODDAMN
Are you all excited?? 23hrs 45mins to go for "Link Start"
cant wait for GGO to be over so he can go back to being male i hope to fucking god that he has a male voice actor im really annoyed at the fact his appearance got a sex change why does all the weird shit have to happen in anime
Kirito is a guy that's just a rare character model called the M9000 or something like that. Also its the same voice actor that played him in the last season.
i know hes a guy thats why i said his appearance and i also meant male character in game
fuck yeah
