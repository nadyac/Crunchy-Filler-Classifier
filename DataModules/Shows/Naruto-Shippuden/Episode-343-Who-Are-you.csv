So, did Kakashi ever take that damn mask off? That's the unmasking I'M waiting for...
Marclee82 I wouldn't call that a plothole. You're forgetting a series of very important factors. that's including Obito's awakening of his mangekoy sharingan, partly fusing with cells from 1 hokage, The wife just gained birth and other stuf

@hyjinx17 thanks for the spoiler...
that was pretty obvious at first glance actually o.O ^ @Rosee332
lol all im saying is the action to is too drawn out the flashbacks are great they give me some backround and make it so I can keep up but the action is fucking annoying way to drawn out
Note to self-never eat sweets whilst trying to use fireball jutsu, you might be kicked in the face
Lmao @EclipsedArchon your picture matches perfect with your comment
im sry obito u lost to guy in the final matches but no one can beat guy he is just well guy
Back to the topic at hand which will probably answer itself, how has Madara been keeping up with the times like this?
kakashi beat guy...
Never thought of kicking some one in the face to stop them from choking... gotta try it next time.. lol
The one voicing Obito is the one who voiced silly/goofy Tobi and I personally liked it. It has a much more serious tone compared to the previous role he played.

well being untouchable and a mask hiding your face...wow I could do anything in this world
He didn't need the Silly Tobi persona anymore. He put it aside like any tool that is no longer needed.
naruto should have done rasen shuriken

Naruto be aware your weakness is stealth rock
*throws master ball* *ball wiggles twice* *ball breaks open* Me: ... RUN!!!
@joel100 toobi or not toobi that is the questions
Leiser that is genius, I think you deserve some applause *pachipachipachipachi*
hhahahahahahaaha this is so funny
Obito's faceee omfg. And then Madara. It was just getting good dammit.
I know right! How do they expect us to stay sane
now we have to wait so long for the next episode..... baaaah
too long. but better if good drawing and good dialogs.
The fact that 90% of this episode was a flashback didn't matter.... I'm still speechless at everything that just happened....
These flashbacks were already part of the series. They aren't being added in. They would literally have to use filler and change the story entirely in order to NOT have these flashbacks.
Obito was an awesome hero before they brought him back from the dead and made him fake Madara. Now he's the biggest disgrace and waste of a good character I've ever seen. All this because his schoolboy crush died not even his GF
I WOULD have been speechless if some stupid person hadn't spoiled it in the comments all the way back at the beginning of the series
The flashback was in the manga chapter revealing Obito's identity.
Guys just because the flashbacks were cannon doesn't mean we're not allowed to be annoyed by them.
(what they're probably thingking) Guys! I think meteorites are falling! we are in big trouble!.....no, wait a sec, its just Madara coming down from the sky (MOMENTARY PAUSE) 0_o )Oh shit!! That's worse then a million Meteorites falling.
Know it!
@ Ant49 don't use fireball jutsu while eating candy, you might choke... that kick probably saved his ass ^^
old gon not new? old gon was takeuchi junko. this voice actor that did younger obito is new gon.
Who the heck let Madara get any cheat code?! If your profile reads Madara, any and all cheats should be set to "Heck naw!"
Madara's presence is bad news. He took a good long look at Obito before he says. "You're hogging all the fun to yourself. Aren't you?"
so he was just like Naruto but went to the dark side...
Yep, as Kakashi to Sasuke
Holy crap, is Obito's voice actor the same as Gon's?!
I TOO AM HAVING A CAPSGASM

Well something like this has been shown before, remember when Yamato was disguised as Sasori way back when Naruto and co. were still looking for Sasuke? He was able to perfectly mimic Sasori's voice at that time.

@sylvertear or you were to stupid to get the joke.
Time for the worst kept secret in the history of anime to be officially unveiled in the
What I do not understand is when Rin died. We clearly saw her at the war memorial in the Chunin Exam Arc.
@threnhster...Dude. Bro. Obito was mentioned in part 1 during the chapter where they have the ceremony for the Sandaime, when Yugao talks to Kakashi by the Memorial Stone. Also: Kakashi Gaiden was released before Part 2 even started
We all know that was obito from the beginning, if you hadn't noticed the missing eye on his left, he also has the exact same hair. How couldn't you notice these things
Xitogun... Well, in the anime ,when Obito was trying to get the eyes of Nagato, he used the forbidden justu Izanagi to not die from Konan's trap and lost his left eye. Maybe he stole that eye from another Uchiha.
For me the major thing was that with that eye deal, his technique was obviously Kamui or some form of it. In fact,when they encountered each other when Sasuke attacked while he was blind, he straight up told Kakashi Kamui wasn't gonna work.
why is the uchia clan so deadly lol... they will never let the leaf live this down.


Why did they change kakkashi's and obito's voice for the flashback?
I Know right? young Kakashis voice used to be roughly the same but a little higher pitched.
They wanted to show how young they were. They got criticized in Kakashi Gaiden for how old Kakashi and Obito sounded so now they made sure to illistrate how young they were. Kakashi was 13 at the time and had an adult voice before.
@Projectchaos86 That's actually a good idea, I never can't get into Sasuke's flashbacks because his voice of old man with like, 6 years. It's totally ridiculous. They also should have given older Naruto a grown-up voice.
I don't think that really holds up all that much though. I mean, look at how the characters' voices in Part 1 were like. The only prominent male character whose voice was that high was Naruto.
TIME FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
and by time....you must mean next time!
Hope that it will be outstanding because, if we have to wait for a trash, it won't make it.

He was impersonating Madara, so it's only natural he would want to use Madara's voice. He has ran into some of his fellow classmates many times throughout the anime, they might've have recognized his voice if he didn't cover it up.
I'm wondering how he impersonated Madara so well. I know in real life it was the same guy voicing Madara and Obito up until this episode. But why didn't they make Obito's Madara voice sound a little different than real Madara?
@apav & megasean 3000. The voice change because he was claiming to be Madara. So, he used Madara's voice. And if you search, it is the same voice actor for Madara's and Obito's voice (before this episode). His name is Naoya Uchida.
They did the same thing with Yamato posing as Sasori way back during the search for Sasuke arc. Yamato sounded exactly like Sasori. It probably comes down to chakra allowing them to do it.
even naruto did it when he turned in to sasuke in like the first couple episode's
man that ending gave me goosebumps for a second. crazy

Perhaps Kisame met the real Madara at that time? maybe the real Madara intruduce him to Obito?
@Natmenz: It was told by Kabuto before that the plan was Madara's, not Obito's when he told Madara he wasn't sure if Obito was still following the plan or not, or something to that effect.
yeah, i just thought, "well, tobi and obito have the same letters, tobi's only eye is a sharingan in his right eye, he might cover his face because its disfigured.." it just made sense as soon as i watched kakashi gaiden!
@Darkprinc979: ah yes, I had forgotten that; so it was answered before the actual reveal. His identity was spoiled for me before I had any real reason to guess and at that point there were enough doubts for it to not quite make sense.
I did correctly guess who Kabuto's trump card was but thought there might have been some other sort of funny business going on which might've caused Madara to not have his body.
The most anticipated episode of the year!
Axerith: While some of the flashbacks are indeed meant to prolong the anticipation, most of it is, however, pure manga material. The fights between Iwa and the boys were prolonged. Else, all new, straight from manga. sylvertear:'bout 1y 3m
I didn't really care who was behind the mask, and after seeing it, I still don't get what the big deal was. Why were you guys so anticipatory, anyway? I was personally anticipating the Naruto/Kurama friendship waaay more.


i know right ive wanted that to happen for so long!
Hmm anyone else feel like all this episode did was confirm last weeks episode? lol
