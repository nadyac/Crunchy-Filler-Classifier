i think it's so funny how all of kenshin's opponents are essentially giants.. but then after they're defeated, they're normal size again..
What the hell is a "vacuum pressure cut"....
it's a special paper cut technique. It won't bleed until you notice the wound yourself, then you'll have hours of agonizing pain.
You know the fight is getting serious when the western guitar gunfight music starts


so true
I thought he was going to be much cooler by the way he had blue hair on the opening sequence, but sadly, he became my least favorite of Kenshin's opponents =/
This series really knows how to play it safe. Nobody important ever gets killed.At least so far...
the storm is ahead
omg Yutaro just die already.. so damn annoying
When his top got cut and one half of his upper body is shown.. Kekekeke..
The riflemen can nail tons of the fodder samurai with ease but can't land a single bullet on any of major bad guys even when they stand still in basically a penalty kick formation. WTH.
That is what happens when you let a Storm Trooper teach you...the future is not always the best (especially when it comes to gunplay...)
Kenshin says he won't kill, but I really want to see him do something brutal like cutting a limb/fingers off in this case.
I wonder.. all I am left with is "what ifs" but it is likely Yutaro would have been stronger than Yahiko if that tragedy hadn't occurred.
