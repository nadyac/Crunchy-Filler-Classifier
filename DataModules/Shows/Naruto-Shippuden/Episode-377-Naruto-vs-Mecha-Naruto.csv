@____@ dafq. did i watched. i cant understand anymore D:

that was kinda stupid
Dude I hated this filler but yes that was the best.

hilarious!
I thought it was kind of funny. Can't really complain too much...
what the fuck did i just watch
My life is now complete, I can die knowing that I have seen the lowest the makers of Naruto can go.
You just watched Iron Man.
um so like how many other anime, movies, tv show stuff did yall see?
gurren lagann reference with the flower comment I think

"Is this a rip-off of my Toad Mouth Trap, Orochimaru?" "Yes"
Nice GIF!
I would have rather hey just skipped this past weeks episode then to have watched this unforgivable mess
i need that gif now -goes to my anime search engine-
It kina looks like Bleach? Because of kinda of its animations..
Naruto=Tony Stark
That was even the Jarvis HUD.
Da fahk was that Jiraiya? When he said his name he was like KAW KAW
RIP Mecha-Me. You will always be remembered. -Mecha-Me 2014-2014
Cri evretim
Ya ill miss his spikey haired light sabers <3
hahaha Gaara: However....I cannot let you have Naruto's Nine Tails .As a Kazegake ..and as Naruto's friend! Naruto:Gaara!You are so cool, you know!
For those who don't know this was special promoting new game. From next week we back to normal episodes.
Thank you so much worldeyes.
i cant wait fro the game i played the demo a couple of time and was wondering when mecha naruto would finally make an appearance.
haha the end with Gaara. I enjoyed this filler. Really funny. Glad we got a little break from the seriousness. Revolution coming soon! Was thinking about the numbers on Mecha Naruto's headband. Could it be year 1976 and the 10 for his bday
I had a feeling this was the case
The game's Awesome! Just played it today for the the first time! Mecha- Naruto really kicks A**!
Rainbow barf.
Haha this episode xD. Deidara teasing gaara. That pun "gaara deserted the battle".. and that ending Hahah.. it felt like watching the naruto spin-off
It really did, the first thing thing that came to mind while watching this was the spinoff! I was pissed@first bc of the fillers but I have to say I really enjoyed it! Freakin hilarious
They even had a cameo of the insulting crow when Kakashi got KO-ed!
Yeah, it's been far too long since we last saw that crow.
Any chances of the spin-off is getting a second season?
Clearly this is a comedy break from all the serious drama that's been going on.
A comedy break that made it's way into the game. Too good.
It was actually written by the creator of Naruto, unlike most filler. This was clearly done to tie in with the game that releases next week, that has the Mecha Naruto. That said, this was the best filler ever.
Naruto, you took Sakura's drugs, didn't you?
What a crazy extra, lol.
Sakura-chan kept her promise.. she ..protected "this" flower ..this ..picked and going to die in a few days ...flower ... bwahahaha
Way to kill the mood there.
LOL rainbow yamato.. I didnt see that one coming xD
Ironman + Naruto... The worst and most epic comedy ever... Can't wait to play as Mecha Naruto!!!
Well you guys wanted more Naruto episodes and you wanted them doubled. Hail to you! Wish granted!
I agree with you guys that I wished that they would of just got on with the show. BUT!!!! this was not a waste of time. This is some of the funniest shit I have ever watched on Naurto. Instead of the feels it was the laughter.
well there goes my morning...
"all you had to do was just squeeze a little " lmao
BUahahahahah!!!! I see what you did there. :O
And so concludes the story of how Naruto did not become Iron Man.
I'm going to pretend this was a couple of episodes of Rock Lee's show.
