Its always fun to watch Hak fight. Bandits, the White Dragon, Yona....it doesn't matter how he fights, physical or verbal, it's always entertaining to watch.

Favourite comment of the day! XD

Wow, Yona is a total player - "No one could replace you" and he blushes like a school girl
Well a Princess like her has to have the skills necessary to keep so many manservants in line.
(Yona) bitches line up!... lololol
"Is the dragon's blood excited again?" Nah that's not the dragon's blood, this time it's your man blood that's excited
XD
He's certainly feeling the wrong "dragon blood" boiling... > 3>
-_- I'm a handsome young man.
Yun: "Be quiet, you jolly exotic beasts." LOL.
"No, look. There are two women over there." -__-
"Princess, hide!" - immediately found xD
how she must rock at hide and be found!!
So many stabs at Yun's pride. First the cage, and now being mistaken for a woman.
He's kinda asking for it by admitting to being weak and not training and wearing feathers in his hair, they don't even look like flight feathers but the fluffy downy feathers...
I love the music in this series
Yeah, I'm sick of crappy pop music.
Sometimes it's good to go retro...

@ProfessorFaust I couldn't agree more

Heh, Yun is such a bishounen that he gets mistaken for a girl
He's not the first character to suffer that fate and he won't be the last.
I feel like this anime will have 50+ episodes hopefully. Would love to see an anime in 2014-2015 with that many if not more. Really bored of 12 episode anime as when I finish them I get depressed if they're really good!
There are more than 100 chapters in the manga so far, I think. And even that has quite a ways to go, so I think we can expect a long run :3
I'd be so happy if it keeps going for quite some time, I absolutely love it
Is he dead? so funny
My first name is Yona imagine my surprise when an otaku like me found this anime :3
Do you happen to have a harem of dragons, bishounen, and man-beasts?
^yaaaas
The White Dragon seems to enhance Hak's trolling powers.

Seriously loving the character interactions in this show. Going from serious to troll to serious so seamlessly. More shows really should be like this!
Yeah, the personalities in this anime really make it relaxingly enjoyable.
Yeah, I seriously adore the cast. Not a bad one in the lot. Watching them hang out together gets more and more enjoyable with each addition.
love the pace of this anime
The way this series balance comedy, drama, and action is masterful.
we need to get more people to watch this season.numbers is what gets a second season. SKPXCEQ93KY M9C7UT4TTLF M7HPTZ6CSBE

"Teasing people is Hak's hobby! Don't let it get to you" in actual - "Being sexy is Hak's job! Try not to get left behind."
