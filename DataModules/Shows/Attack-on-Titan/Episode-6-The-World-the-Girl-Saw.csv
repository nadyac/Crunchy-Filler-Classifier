I REALLY SHOULD STOP READING SPOILERS, BUT THEY ARE SOOO TEMPTING!!!
CrazySaVunT Also Eren dad "Grisha" means watchful in german
im crazy for mikasha
@aandreas32 The only thing I can think of is when Mikasa suddenly becomes the main character.

I bet Mikasa is going to go apeshit next episode
You lost your bet.


I see what you're trying to say, but you falter a bit when you equate "male", "sexist", and law-of-the-jungle motif. Real-world history paints quite a different picture, when you look back past the last couple centuries.
@actionhero112: No, it's really not. Why would they show all of the soldiers failing miserably over and over again if it were a power fantasy show? And why would the most powerful character be a woman if it were a sexist show?
@SavingTheDay - exactly. This show keeps me on the edge of my seat more than anything I've watched in years.

You forget that over 100 years has passed since they walled themselves in. There also wasn't just one asian as stated earlier in this episode. Originally there were more asians, but they were killed off by Titans or just didn't reproduce.
I'm guessing the comment Orsenna replied to was mine. For those curious, I had originally asked where people like me (of African descent) had gone to. Not sure why it was considered offensive. If they blended, shouldn't everyone be browner?
Travel was very slow in the days when there were only horses. It wouldn't be realistic for people from other lands to be able to make it to the walls for safety, save for the random foreign traveler in the right place at the right time.
Asian culture is fairly homogenous, not like other parts of the world. Probably all it is.

@togiraikonoka you'll see...you'll see.....

Tragedy just makes you grow up fast, aka opens your eyes to the darker side of life and forces you to deal with it. <- and that will change a person, some more than others.

You're all missing the point. Yeah, Eren had the ability to mount a violent attack against murderers, but what's really important is that was the day Mikasa's brain got re-wired, and she became an efficient killer. Mikasa is a destroyer.

---a most excellent story from this awesomely produced anime? diabolical intent is rampant

I want episode 7 to come out now!
Well, I noticed that some people who were impatient and watched the episode early somewhere else said that this episode was filler, I do not think it was. The contents of this episode will prove very important in future episodes, I think.

definitely not filler. enjoy
This episode is straight from the manga. There won't be any filler in this anime.
Back story is not filler. It adds to the characters.

Dam shes bad-ass although after what she went through as a child i guess it was either become that or just be broken...
Yay, finally I get to see the Titan who was late for their first day of school.
Falcon132: The titan equivalent of toast would be having a human hanging from it's mouth as it ran.
COOOOKIIIIEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was probably the brother of that Moe Titan from before. lol
I imagined the running aberrant titan was thinking, "An evacuation? Where?? Wait for meeee!"
But he totally punted some guy walking down the street.

I love how this series makes you want more each time you watch it. It gives an answer the the last episode and gives you a new question to think about for the next.

Badass episode, badass chick, and badass storyline couldn't ask for more! XD
I can and do. more episodes
LOL well of course :p
I'm amazed after just 6 episodes, particularly this one, Mikasa is one of my favorite anime characters ^.^

Mcdonaldsmaster whoever told you there was more eps then posted on here has more then likely given you the wrong info. No one, including in Japan has seen beyond episode six.
