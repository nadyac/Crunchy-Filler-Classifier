I'll buy you ramen afterwards..... No thanks..... lol what did you think he was naruto?!?! hahaha

Naruto=blonde Ichigo=Orange No, they don't have the same hair color.
Biggest "Face-palm" ever -___-
jus like brock lesner
yeah maestro your picture is lame
For some reason, watching this feels nostalgic. I'm not sure if it's because the series is somewhat restarting or not, but it reminds me of the time that I saw Bleach for the first time.
after reading ur comment i almosted cried
._____. orihime's boobs got even bigger? dear lord.
Hell man, the bigger the better



It's odd that her thighs haven't gotten bigger when her chest has.
Random question but...what happened to the visords?!?

yea ichigos friends do look different but I think that's pretty realistic, if you ask me.
Dude... EVERY CHARACTER IS HOTTER NOW!
it's not me right? Inoe's boobs got bigger right? like they needed to be. I like the longer hair too. Everyone looks better. Except Uryu. He looks really angular.
Yes they defiantly got bigger , there so distracting now lol before i could resist them but...now...i thought it was me only at first to . they were huge before. now there silly over the top big...she should be a little chubby so they fit.

I think it's just the anime. In the manga her body looks less deformed and more in proportion, her mug also looks prettier. Same goes for most of the characters.
Yeah, some portraits they draw in manga are just stunning, specially the face up ones.
"Do you miss her?" "Of course not." ICHIGO, YOU BITCH. STOP LYING.
that guy with the eye patch looks like King Bradley from fullmetal!!!
this feels like a new start of bleach completley
What are you talking about? This arc will become bad ass very soon. Believe me, in the manga it kicked butt. Hopefully they'll do it here to. Be patient.
Ichigo: "H-HOW DO YOU DO THAT?! YOUR EYES LOOK LIKE NUMBER 3's!" Tatsuki: Orihime has many faces~! >D Orihime: 3w3
Lots thinking the same thing - character designs are all abit tweaked and look good. Orihime and Tatsuki look better for sure. The arc sure feels like it should have happened right after the Aizen arc too.
I don't like the way Tatsuki's hair looks, she looks like she has a mullet. I'm surprised anyone liked her new look. Short hair looked better than that abomination....
she's obviously just gained immense power as we learned in the aizen arc, longer hair=more power
i was hoping they kept his hair a little bit longer as he grew older
Why does the bartender resemble King Bradley from fullmetal alchemist??
Well, it's finally back to the main story line.
I will miss the other hot captains in the soul society :'(
Did anyone else notice Renji was on the cover of the game? 06:14
So Im not the only one!!! ALso I think it also had Byakuya and either Hanataro or Rukia.
Renji, Byakuya and Rikichi
Love the hair style updates they got, that is one thing ive respected about Bleach, they keep updating how the characters look, in both looks and what they wear, Lets see where this arc will take us.
Wow they made Orihime's boobs bigger and her brain smaller. Im loving this already.
funny you call orihime dumb considering she was number 3 in her class.
What is with Tatsuki's Mullet??? O.o ... this is proof the Bleach staff is mostly men that have no fashion sense at all... lol oh well... good thing they tell a good story.
No sense of fashion?!? I love Tatsuki's new hair style.
Thank you, I'm glad someone noticed, I can't believe how many people say they like her hair, it's a catastrophe, She looks horrible with a mullet. Short hair on her was way better, and anyone that says otherwise is dumb.
