Never underestimate what a woman can hide in her cleavage.
right.... kittens...
i just love the fact that apparently women have black holes when it comes to their bras
...When I scrolled down before the video, I was expecting any comment but this...
Oh god! Just noticed that the guy with the candle up his bum is actually Rogue!!! XD Poor boy doesn't get a break!
No wonder I didn't see Erza's luggage she carries around on jobs. It's in her cleavage-kabo
Freed got shot down harder than Juvia 2.0. Ouch.
on the bright side erza captured a kagura-chan and milliana-chan
grays gone ice cold
Ezra confirmed Bi, and of excellent taste. Get that harem rolling, You Fairytail!
lmaooooo
yap
Erza is a true magician!!!! xD

Nothing overpowers the magic of boobs.

I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ULTEAR! Really hoping she has the chance to continue to pursue a life that brings her satisfaction, or better yet, happiness.
i would say were most likely to see 1 or 2 filler arcs b4 the next start of the manga's current arc
LOL, Erza pulling out Happy, Carla & Lily out of her oppais xD
aye sir!
Da hell? Everyone is wearing medieval clothing but Natsu is wearing a modern black suit.. LOL
Well to be fair he dressed up as the king
Natsu is just ahead of fashion
Fairy Tail Fridays!!! Time to DANCE!

no to mexican power
To bad Mexicans aren't the only ones that speak Spanish!
LIES AND SLANDER!
what does speaking in Spanish has to do with the episode? I mena I speak it Spanish too but I didnt hear anything out of the ordinary e_e .. the heck?
Well now we know Erza's Boobs are like Hermioni's never ending magic bag. I mean she pulled three cats out em.
They shoulda had virgo come out at the punishment part.
I don't want to know the story of how Erza managed to fit/convince all three exceeds in her cleavage P.S. I kinda want to get that pumpkin hat now-kabo
If I were a talking magical cat, I wouldn't need any convincing to get in Erza's cleavage, kabo! I wouldn't even need to be a talking magical cat to be convinced, kabo!
Everyone's punishment is to where a pumpkin hat for a week, KABO!!
You know shit gets real when Erza can pull cats out of her boobs
I was wondering how they were going to animate that part of the manga chapter. Color me surprised!
I fucking died laughing
That's the power of a strong PLOT right there, kabo!
I practically passed out when Natsu entered

shippn so hard right now
A magician can pull a rabbit out of a hat. Erza can pull magical talking cats out of her boobs. Science!
I'm just surprise that Happy didn't say something funny when he came out of her boobs. If Fairy Tail is going to keep doing this then get edgy get High School DxD on us!
I gotta say that every new version of Juvia vastly improves on the previous 1. Stupid Gray I hope a new guy starts hitting on Juvia & she's semi-attracted to him to see the that look of despair on your face! Is the princess hitting on Natsu
where exactly is she hitting on natsu? I missed it O_O
That's what I'm saying. That never happens.
The princess was totally in love with Nastu
She isn't, although I wish she were.
Erza can dance with me all night long

Damn it Kagura! Call Erza Onee-chan already......Kabo
It's Ruko and Satsuki all over again.
Well shit, I guess I should have taken those spanish classes back in high school
[This comment has been removed]
the subs are in english
maybe you guys should take computer1 level classes in HS/Uni. All you need to do is right click & boom English subs. I have seen these type of comments recently I can't believe people don't know how to use a mouse! BTW, Spanish's super easy
Kabo!
At first the subs would be in spanish regardless of the setting...
