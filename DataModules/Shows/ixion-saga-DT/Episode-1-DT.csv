lol "your wide open", i've watched so many anime and always wondered why other characters wait for their opponent to finish their speech or monologue rather than doing just this.
i read the comment first before even watching the first episode now i get it hahaha LMFAO!!! i cant stop laughing..help!!
and the moments when the villain are open and occupied and no one does anything...
Lesson: Never pick an ultimate attack that takes too long to charge, for you will get kicked in the balls.
@Aquilabad or if you take to long the enemy can always counter ( there is no time to wait for them to be ready attack )
anyone else notise that his shoes have horns and that it was the horn that hit, looks like he put all his power in that kick, all that power, concentrated on the tip of that horn... ouch. i don't think he'll be able to have any kids now
This anime seems to be really lame...I'm going to watch every episodeXD
wtf that's a guy 0_o i think i need to spend some time alone in the woods
Anyone else think Crocodile Dundee when that happened?
I have been watching anime since I was 3 years old and have always wanted to see an ending like that. Epic nutshot interrupts ultimate move. That one moment made this entire series worth it. I will never ever forget it.
You get a thumbs up for posting the very comment I was going to make. You saved me about 45 seconds..maybe not now. But thanks all the same.
yasssssss

now a day if a girl talks to you on th computer most likely have a voice mod and is actually 50 yearold pedo
Even I could feel that one for several minutes afterwards... And I wasn't even the one kicked!
Terrible :'(
@imanibonevingi It's not uncommon. Well. In the grand scheme or things - or anime. lol. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexualism
i always tell the ppl to kick them in the ballz when they be talking and shit, FINALLY THEY UNDERSTAND ME
LOL. I can't help but call that ED guy Erectile Dysfunction.
Morale of story,.never flirt with women online
I knew that green haired girl sounded too much like a guy to be a girl!
I watch this while im waiting for a new episode of Sword Art Online
same here, I love the Sword Art Online show. Sorry the game is only coming out for the Playstation portable.
Yeah I would buy it if it came out on xbox or pc. It would be awesome if SAO and NerveGear and stuff like that was real, I would buy it in an instant, no matter the cost.
even if you died irl when you died in game? thats a pretty high cost haha
oh, id pay it if i had to. so long as the game is epic.
Why the compares to SAO? Closer to Familiar of Zero or Dog Days. Or are you too stupid to realize he met someone in a game who dimension transfered (DT) his real life body to another plane? Plus it's a comedy, unlike SAO. Baka.
you said what i was thinking. thank you.
lol, nothing interrupts an Ultimate move, than being kicked in the nuts.
Gotta remember, level 1, buy shoes
FINALLY SOME FREAKING LOGIC...no guard up at all and legs spread...why not aim there? he sure as hell as the shoes for it! xD! -laughing so hard-
lol now ED really will have ED lol
the battle music sounds like final fantasy music (FF7 boss music, specifically).
Ikr lol :3
its the comedy version of SAO . . . . a little to kiddy for me ill just wait for the next episode of SAO
kotaku got me here..
idk what i just watched...but its so freaking awesome!!!
Like MOnster Hunter and SAO haha
OMG; sorry, second comment; This episode is INCREDIBLY HILARIOUS. That drop! XD && OMG. Jun Fukuyama... you are, omg, LOL !!
