omg that school is enormous, how come everyone acts so calmly, I'd probably get lost and starve to death
also I don't believe he trusts him at all really, so I wouldn't feel safe sleepin in the same room
He still needs the training to control his power, learn how to fight against larger demons (like Astaroth), learn how to exorcise without the need of his sword and powers, and also the different kinds of demons out there.
Besides, I don't think his brother really meant all that he said (especially with that small clip after the credits lol). I think he thinks dearly of his brother and really wants to find a remedy to Rin's demon soul.

I got a serious kill la kill vibe when seeing the academy for the first time.
why did i even put off watching this anime till now? seriously.
Been thinking the same thing, happened to decide to watch it after reading some of the manga
the anime is better than manga in my opinon
don't do your homework: you get shot... best anime i've watched yet
I watched the first half and the first episode and said "no, doesn't look like a show for me". Well, I was wrong...Just now on the third episode and man I'm glad I started this. AWESOME show!
To answer people's question about why he always carry the sword around school and no one wonders why he has it. in Japan, Kendo is a sport. As long as they don't see what's inside. They'll think its a bamboo sword.
Humans cannot see the physical attributes of a demon. So if one were to be possessed by a demon, a human would have not noticed (besides the dramatic change in character).
Maybe the humans can't, but I'm sure the exorcists can, especially after they get their first battle wounds

Because the exorcists can see the demonic aspects of other demons or people who are possessed, I was wondering why Rin hasn't commented on Mephistopheles' pointed ears/teeth, since the name apparently isn't a give away.
he kinda reminds me of haru from my little monster..
haha i know right

Totally
He reminds me of Grey (I think his name is) from Fairy Tail. Ya know, the guy who always takes his shirt off.
yup true
I'm digging the sound track to this anime
Yea its not bad
I have the opening (Core Pride) Already downloaded on my mp3.
Man im digging that opening, i cant help but listen to it everytime
Oh God dorming with my brother would suck...
People are saying that Yukio looks hot? Pshhh. That's a joke. Rin looks better xD
Ikr....but wouldn't it look wierd if you have pointy ears and really sharp teeth..but i think Rin still looks cool with it or without it,either way.
Rin is awesome. It all matters on personality, not grades.
Well, I don't think normal people would notice his features because it's basically like what that guy Astaroth possesed looked like. People without a masho wouldn't notice. Still, I think Rin is cooler.
Rins a lot cooler. I mean come on. He looks like gray. :3 (fairy tail ish cool)
This anime starts off intense. I like that.
so funny when he was freakin out bout the school. everyone was just staring at him.
That would be my reaction. Me in classroom at True cross: OH SHIT IT'S HUGE!!!!!!
i think we all would XD

That is quite possibly the best exclamation I've heard. I'm definitely borrowing that.
shoot, im supposed to be finishing up a project but instead im watching anime
i like rin's hair..
i like every inch of rin
;[
if they are showing commercials....i wish at least they were showing something diff everytime...i keep seeing the same one and i know the commercial like the back of my hand.
I think that's the point of the advertising, haha. Like it or not, we know the ads by heart now. :-/

stupid commercials
same commercial 3 times back to back! NOT COOL
the moles on his face are somewhat distracting.
yup
the only words to describe this is, fucking incredible.
oh wow that academy looks completely out of place xD
Lol I love Rin's reaction to the school XD
