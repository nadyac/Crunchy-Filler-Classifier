when spells don't work... USE A SHOTGUN.
Holy Hand Grenade Fallout New Vegas Wild Wasteland Perk
when he grabbed the shotgun I thought of supernatural right away

yeah, it works for Dean Winchester all the time XD
Screw Supernatural, "This is my Boomstick!"
Wow and Luke was upset when he found out Darth Vadar was his father, Luke has nothing to complain about at least his daddy isn't freakin SATAN
Sounds like he'd fit in with the cast of South Park.
Rin is son of Satan and Nico D'Angilo is the son of Hades (Percy Jackson refrence xD)
@shugo_chara_rocks_11 I love you for that reference
Hades is actually supposed to be a pretty swell guy. Zeus is the real dick.
wrong^
lol "YOU CAN CALL ME PAPA, IF YOU WANT!" -funny pose-
Hell yes. That's a win.
Damn, second episode and I'm already crying. Now that's a first.
damit why am I such a freaking wimp why is this making me cry my heart should be racing not filled with emotion damit f you weak heart
5cm/sec is the only anime that ever made me cry.
...Fma made me cry many times. Their mothers death, the whole transmutation scene, when that one cat died, every time they mentioned something sad. Heh ima wimp
@OldCrowe Same here, my friends say im a bad person because i never feel emotion when watching even "really sad" mvies
I watched Angel Beats with my friend and didn't cry, I got beaten with a baseball bat.
Got to love the holy hand grenade!
Yup!

also when holy water is spraying everywhere
Certainly didn't expect to like this anime so much, but hey, pleasant surprises sure are nice.
i think i would die a little on the inside if someone told me i was the offspring of satan
yeah i know.
I would go to school saying I was being possessed.LOL

^until you get thrown into the loony bin simon
Or you could stay home saying your possessed.
I love the ending song. Why did i put off watching this masterpiece? Stupid procrastination
if you love take off listen to more if 2PM ^^
I put it off too. I just finally have only simulcasts in my queue so I decided to give this a shot. I never thought it would be like this. Rin's voice actor is really keeping me on my toes in this. So I'm gonna stick around
I was putting it off because it seemed like a typical shonen from the description, but this is awesome! So glad to watch it.
Being able to watch Anime in 480p and HD is well worth the premium membership people. Even if you get adblock, that doesn't change the fact you're watching in SD.
Premium membership rocks my world.
Aw maaaaaan. Everytime. EVERYTIME I watch Rin crying out 'Tou-san" I cry. Always.
WTF WHAT EXORCIST CARRYS A FREAKING SHOTGUN???
You never watched supernatural have you. that shotgun is loaded with rock salt not bullets XD
silver pellets
why can't I live in an anime
i feel u bro dw LOL

Everyone wants to live in Aincrad, no other place matters.
Technically, I do. Yukio looks exactly like me, I swear. Just, I have less moles

Does satan have to pay child support?
Why do you think he dumped Rin and Yukio on the priest? To avoid paying!

Woah. This episode. WHY DIDN'T I WATCH THIS ANIME SOONER????? 1. I am in tears. 2. The soundtracks of this series are fucking amazing. 3. Rin's voice actor is SO FREAKING GOOD. AHH THE SOUNDTRACKS AND THE VOICE AND THE ANIMATION IS JUST
OMG. RIGHT?!?!?!
I feel like the mafia will come after me if I say meh. (but seriously how do animes get this good)
2 episodes and already tugging at the heart. That was fast. Also, this ending theme though.....I like ^_^
dudle lol lol
Err! i cried..
hahaha....got to love reading on non-members comment about having to watch the same ads over and over
