Geun-Tea's wife is so cute and adorable. Just serving tea without realizing her country became rich.
they remind me of Sanai and Akio from Clannad
It's like they're captured my personality with Yuno. I'm always fawning over cute things, and getting happy when people share a beer with me.
Basically if you think everything is cute, you suddenly become cute. Anime life lessons 101.
hell yea
The reason things are cute is when their innocents are preserved. And happiness is obtained by how well-decisive people are.
It's hard to see such a care-free Su-Won now, when compared to the start he did something so terrible to Yona. It makes me wonder what he's thinking and planning now...
i think suwon can be a good emperor .... but idk if i like him or not...
Most of the greatest kings and emperors in history were despicable people.
Su-won could well be the main character of this story, and if he was and the story was told more from his point of view we would be rooting for him as the savior of the kingdom , not Yona.
@iashakezula In episode two Su-won said that King Il killed his father. So a big part of it was revenge. (Plus King Il already told Yona that he wouldn't let her marry Su-won.)
it would be amazing if they told the story from yona's perspective, then su-wons and Haks
Soo Won is what you call a wolf in sheep clothing. Makes it hard to see his true motives.
I just thinking in the previous episode how all the more horrible it is to that he uses expressions comparable to that of a sheep of all things which covers over his wolf-like motives.

I'm kinda scared of Su-won.. It's obvious he did all this on purpose; The tea trade, the stone being popular, not enough workers for the mines... HE'S A (SCARY) TACTICAL GENIUS!
Just in case my reply to another comment above got missed: She did, she totally did!! http://natalie.mu/comic/news/129090
What if Su-won is pulling a major Lelouch here? This might be a giant calculated plan to make the Kingdom a better place in order to have Yona finally take back the throne.
@J-Fox - I could see the Lelouch thing. A lot of sacrifices and a big price to pay at the end though.
@J-Fox: that would be great!

This anime has recently taken a turn for MUCH better! An evil act turns out to be an act of compassion for the empire, rather than being an act of revenge. This is probably one of the most unique plot ideas I've seen in a feudal anime.
This style of "bad guys" is actually quite common. The evil is seen as the bad guys but they have different views on what they have to do to protect what they believe in, even if it means getting your hands dirty.
@Avenz255 Can you give examples of FEUDAL animes that have these so-called anti-heroes then?
Soo-Won definitely has a bigger plan that we don't know about. Whether it's good or bad we don't know? He is the antagonist but it could be that there is no evil but 2 sides of the same coin. Who knows
Yes, so far it seems Soo-won's master diabolical plan is...exactly what he said it was. To restore Kouka to it's former greatness - starting with improving the lives of the citizens.
He's still a douchebag in my opinion.
The fact that Suwon doesn't to be a bad person or king makes it so hard to hate him!! And although this gave us some insight about him, I needed my weekly dose of Yona's harem!!!
He said in one of the first episodes that his father should have been king and he was supposed to be the heir and he was taking the kingdom back for his father. He also thinks King Il had his father killed so it's revenge and family honor?
It baffles me how people can still be convinced that Soo-won is a puppet after seeing this episode. He seems far too intelligent to be manipulated in such a way. Killing Il was a choice he made, knowing and accepting the consequences.
It's entirely possible he is a willing puppet. If being a puppet would further his goals, I would not put it past him.
well being a puppet and being manipulated are two different things. he could've been pushed towards this path. Just because someone is insanely intelligent doesn't mean their emotions/actions can't be played with
The difference between being a puppet and being manipulated is being an unused puppet. Being a willing puppet is actually being the puppeteer.

That was a nice interlude before we return to Yona and co. It makes it difficult to come to a proper opinion about Su Won because he's done something unforgivable to Yona and Hak but he's also working to bettering their country.
I kinda want the song of the old OP back... I feel it suited the show more.
First OP with second ED would be best to fit the show, imo. The current OP is a great song but I don't think it fits that well, or at least /as well/ as the wordless ferocity of the 1st one. As for this ED, it's the style that's better fit.
Same! First OP was more fitting and unique. New OP could be attached to just about any other anime... I prefer original over commonplace any day!
I skipped the new OP, it just doesn't fit this Anime.
The old OP was one of the few that I watched past the first episode. I skipped the new OP 1/2 way though the first time watching it. I have no clue what the studio though when they decided to use it
Old OP was a great piece & really fit this anime, new OP is a good song but doesn't fit
I can see why Yuno married Geun Tea, Everyone seems to love him... Even the guys! He has a pretty awesome wife though!
I love villains like Su-won. It seems like he truly wants to the kingdom to be better and to be a nation of strength like it once was. Interesting to see how his character develops and what the Yona group confrontation will be like...
He would be like Hitler I think, please correct me if I'm mistaken
Well, for one, he isn't out to kill an entire group of people due to their religious beliefs and doesn't believe arbitrary physical and genetic traits are superior with all else second-rate. There, I took your bait and ate it, too.
Hmmmm.... this episode is really making me re-evaluate my opinion of the current king. :T
A whole episode without Hak and Yona and I ain't even mad, it was that good. But I don't know how to deal with these new feelings for Su-won! This guy is not to be played with...
Damn it... Now I'm gonna feel conflicted when Yona comes to take the throne back... Su-won does make a pretty damn fine kind...
This is why Soo-won is my second favorite character. That combination of genuine ditziness, faked ditziness, and ruthlessness just really works for me.
Perfect wife? Perfect wife!

Is it bad that I'm really starting to like Su-won? I'm not supposed to like him right?
Su-won truly is a genius. He's even manipulating the viewer's feelings.
I kinda miss the old opening.
