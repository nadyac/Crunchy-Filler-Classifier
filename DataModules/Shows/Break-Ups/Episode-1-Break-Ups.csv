They are in fact speaking Korean
I knew it wasn't Japanese was wondering if it was Chinese
Korea sounds right. I didn't change tones enough for mandarin. I like the bluntness of it. Good stuff
So, who else saw Hogwartz as a destination in the station?
Lol prolly one of the best 14mins you can spend on crunchyroll~
Glad Crunchyroll invests in these short anime features. Really good to see this sort of work.
wher was this little gem hiding for so long
The stairwell scene at about minute 8 is simply devastating. . .
omg... its just like Korean dramas lol Guy -"Dont follow me now.." Girl - "LJVHRFLKVROEHEOR WTF NO YOU BITCH ETHSKBVBSRVSLRV"
I adore the art style they used in this. The sweet story mixed with it is just perfect. Well done.
sigh... I've been single for too long lol
me too cx
That was so cute (and short)... they were obviously NOT meant to break-up! lol!
From the synopsis I thought this would be like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and it was in a way. Average animation and character designs though. The "behind the scenes" illustrations over the credits were a cute touch.
Indeed. This reminded me so much of that movie, just a lot less depressing. So, at the end, the guy searched and found the device in order to use it again?
awww, so cute!!
Wow it was amazing, so simple but deep With such short time they managed to make a cute film without being rushed or missing anything.
Where had this little gem been hiding?! Not bad, especially for one I just happen to stumble across...
i want to know the name of the song and the singer that made that song. too beautiful to describe for words, even in a different language
Lack of communication is the fall of every relationship. Building trust is key.
May i know who sing the song My everything?
The end credits say "Nia"
May i know who sing My everything this song?
The subtitles are really inaccurate at times... sort of made me choke. Anyways, I enjoyed. Mucho Gusto.
Definitely Korean.
