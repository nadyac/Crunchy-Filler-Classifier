At around the 15 minute mark, that was almost quite literally a WALL of text.

Ugh, It ended on such a cliff hangar and now the sequel will be made 3 years after the original apparently...

Make sure you watch to the very, very end, after the credits.
i don't know why but every time i see rieneer's face,i cant help remembering the armored titan..... I have not read the manga so I am just speculating.
and that last scene they really want us to have nightmares i can't sleep right now Q_Q
Thanks bruh
Sooooooo....that thing at the end........ermmm.....after the credits............That is a "Titan wall.." *breathed laughter*..................or nawh.... >.> But still creepy ending... Keep us guessing.
teenage mutant ninja....TITAN?
EVERYONE THROW MONEY AT RANDOM ATTACK ON TITAN MERCHANDISE SO THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE SEASON 2 JUST AS GOOD. FUCK FEEDING YOUR KIDS THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT,
Loooool
Truer words have never been spoken.

Season 2 has already gotten release date... More precisely, a "year date" it's been told to be released in 2016.
That's a good idea especially sense the Japanese economy just tanked.
annie use harden. its super effective
oh my god
She used haki.
Why didn't I ever think about that till I read your comment? XD

you could always use the stock market
@nemikati well kind of, you could support the animation company but not this show specifically. Whereas if you buy merch than it shows interest in this particular show as well as gives everyone involved more money. I suppose you could...
always become a sponsor and send money with instruction to use it one AoT season 2 but who knows if they would.
They are probably already making it with the material that is available and will be ready to release as soon as they get enough for a second season.
they have most likely already made it and are just being really trollish by not releasing it until 2016
isn't funny everytime Eren and Annie fought they end up in some type of sex position.
the fact that you thought of it that way means your a pervert, most of thous positions were wrestling moves.
LOL I knew someone would be thinking this xD
@slayerRex What wrestling moves? The ones that involve a bed?
every position is a sex position.
That is because naturally before having sex humans wrestle. It's so the male can show that he can have dominance over the female. If the female wins then they don't' mate.
Best anime of the year! Most enjoyment I've gotten out of a series in a long time. Thanks to the director, author and everyone that worked on this amazing anime, and all the emotions it spurred !! But now I feel empty reaching the end lol:(
i hope there another one..there so much i still don't know
I heard there wont be a second season but the last episode will come out in December and will go to the extent to being in select cinemas according to various magazines. BUT I DONT LIKE IT!!!!!! ITS FRUITS BASKET ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!
The reason why I'm sure the second season will be great is because they're taking their time, I hope they keep it short at about 50+ episodes like Full Metal Alchemist and Death Note, then again....Death Note didn't have the best ending.
I'm guessing that they will make a 2nd season once the manga get's far enough or finishes, they have already said that they will make a 2nd season but not this year 2014 since they are working on a movie. The Manga comes out monthly.
They are starting production next year.
Damn, gotta love that symbolism with Mikasa giving Eren the bread. She first did that after Eren's mother died, to tell him to continue to survive, and she did it again when he was having thoughts about accepting death.
Female Titan Waifu *punted*
aright I'll bite,,, whats a wifu? Been reading manga and watching anime for many moons and just figured out what a "tsundere" and the many derivatives, oh and "moe" i got that this year - you can tell i'm not much a "Slice Of Life'er"
It's probably how a Japanese would pronounce the English word "wife", but with the Japanese accent. Thus, "waifu".

"Let us thank the lord for the beautiful day, for once again you have protected us from the Tita-" .... "God dammit, Eren."
@ginger95 My birthday's also in April! And if the next season comes out on my birthday, I swear it'll be the best birthday ever
i believe it will take more than a year and a half to get enough content to make a second season.
lol. To a point, don't you think it would have been better to have Annie transferred to a different district and while she was on the way, ambush her and see it she turns into a titan to defend herself, and if she does have a trap lying in
wait for her in case she does? That way she and Erin wouldn't has trashed stohess district. poor politicians...... wait a minute! f*** politicians! Ignore this comment!
they annoucnd its coming summer 2014 and to kickstart it, they are releasing the movie first

Still a funny joke.
no manga spoilers plz
Yeah can't wait till, dunno 2014? when reveal why Titans were such great choice in mortar - i wonder about the time the walls were being built, if they sprayed townsfolk with amnesia gas or the MIB show up? Nobody remembers 100 years ago..
@1ManNamedDan: They must have buried their history and/or witnesses in the wall as well...
yeah i kinda realized that after the credits. watch past the credits everyone.

You can suck our balls koopa.
Wallists, tch....
koopa9888, the manga readers don't know too much more about this than the anime watchers.
i read this in a hank hill voice
@Hexual, Yeah that does work for the lead comment. Ummmm @ThatGai you kinda left out the spoiler select box there don't ya maybe think?
"I'll take some bread...AND EAT IT!"
lmao
nice death note reference
Death Note
Gentlemen, It's been a pleasure. I'll see you next season.
That freakin feel when u start watching a really good anime to realize that you caught up and have to wait every week for a new one.. and then when the season ends u now have to wait a life time.... :'(
the anime might be over but know we can enjoy the manga up until this point. i was holding off on reading to avoid spoilers and pass the time for the second season.
Is there really even a hint of a shadow of a doubt that such a wildly popular anime, with a rabid fanbase, screaming things like "Take my money just make some merch already!" - would a sane person question the likeliness of another season?

@!ManNamedDan: I have never before wanted a Chibi Plushie, but if they made one of Sasha I just might buy it...
Weekends will never ever be the same again!!!
maybe we dont have to wait till April. I hope! One piece had a time skip of 2 years,they said it will come out in a years time but they changed their minds and it came out the next month. There is still hope people.
There is no backing to the rumor that season 2 is coming in April. It definitely won't be coming in a month. If it comes, it will be, at minimum, one year from NOW, because there is only enough manga left for less than half a season.
I suppose, I'll watch AoT again, from the beginning... No... I'll wait a few months and watch it again from the start... Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do. *sigh* What else am I gonna do in the mean time? Maybe I'll study, and do homework....
@DeadlyOats, Same plan I have for watching Breaking Bad : C ... Man, sundays really did just die off
ThatGai it has been longer than a year from that comment. :'(
And we thought waiting a week was bad.
i know right
i feel like im dying a week later... I came here looking for episode 26.. to realize there is no episode 26. And that I will have to wait. NOOOOO
Same thing happened to me, So sad the season is over. Best anime I have watched in a VERY long time. Can't wait for second season.
I gave you your hundredth like
Is annie doing...muay thai?
Yeah, she did utilize one of the escapes taught in BJJ. Eren's style seems to be a hybrid one, and I believe I read Eren's Titan body was based off pro MMA fighter Yushin Okami.

wait....so is annie's dad Apachai Hopachai?!!

*Wall hanger
lol
D: dont end
HOLY SHIT EVERYONE WAIT TIL THE END OF THE CREDITS
shit now I want to buy the Manga... I can't wait till season 2!
manga is a succession of cliffhangers that are released monthly....
^he's right you know... every time you see a new chapter you debate whether you want to spend 10 hours guessing how the situation will turn out in the next chapter..... never fails.
what chapter is this in the manga
