was this a great episode im sure the baby will reply "that it is' lmao.....
de gozaru yo
I loved the baby saying that. XD
"The times are created not by swords, but by the people who use them." Awesome.
Even though he didn't know that it was a sakabattou, he did push himself to the limit of losing his mind again and become a man-slayer for the little boy. Yup, that is what a real hero would do. This anime rocks.
Can you imagine the feels? He didn't even examine the evidence of the situation ("Look at the sword!"), to try and forgive himself after the fact.
The intensity of this show doesn't end! xD Too bad Kenshin got another sakabatou, way too convenient. I guess we'll never see him at full strength ever. Baby: gozaru!
Rurouni Kenshin Trust and Betrayal.
OMG THAT SHEATH BETWEEN BLADE - BLADE BREAKS AWESOMENESS
"That person I parted wi...."COMMERCIAL! FUCK YOUR SUBTITLE!
Intense
Lol "I'm going inverted"
Really? How did he not notice when he struck the guy that it was a reverse blade? The distinct lack of blood and entrails kinda gave it away...
