Of course of all places the Ghoul was in the womans changing room spying on girls undressing... perverted Ghouls, tisk tisk. Hahah who knows how long it would of stayed there watching them if it hadn't "leaked" on Paku.
I myself cant afford to get premium, as such am willing to watch the ads, its immature to complain to a legit site. All they ask is watch ads in lue of payment. It just bothers me to see so many complaints about this.....
This site is amazing and they a lot of good anime but ive heard of almost all of them. I mean, not everyone has heard of FMA (FMAB) and stuff like that. Sure I know what it is but everytime I ask someone if they've heard of fma they say no.
yeah stars and HD anime ftw. paying less than $10/month is totally worth it!
I just can stand her eyebrows.
8 dollars a month.. I mean really with prices now a days just don't eat lunch once a month o.0 or do a ramen lunch
AdBlock Plus works just fine. :3

I don't like that stuck up purple-haired girl ._.
I wanna do other things to her >.>

@Wildcat this is the sixth time watching the anime for me.. I still wholeheartedly concur with KingGoldZ... I wanna pimp slap that bitch o.0 Turning a naive girl into your slave just because you can is wrong..Kinda like kicking a puppy imo
Rin is a really interesting main character. He's not constantly over-the-top but he's not pathetic either. I think that's one of the reasons I love this show :3
most shows they have the main charecter be weak and always get his or her ass beaten in here rin always stands up thats why i like this.
Rin's hair looks so cute with the hair clip in it! XD
Adorable XD
Boys should wear cute hair clips more often. I'm not into full-on crossdressing but little things like that are really adorable. :3
Occasionally my little boys use my black head bands to keep their hair out of their eyes and it's soo cute!
i actually like his hair pinned back like that
This is one of the best anime this season. I love the way things are developing. Rin is so cool. Much more than the clever know-all Yuki.
Yay! Shiemi! I'm so glad she pulled through in the end. I am also happy that Izumo got what was coming to her. She deserved to cry and feel like garbage. (I know that's mean, but how she treated Shiemi was totally unfair.)
Curse you flying blender!
Wait wait wait wait. Did Rin just.............Scratch his NIPPLE?!?!?!?!?!?! XD
They react to a guy taking off his shirt but not Izuno in her underwear?
Awww Shiemi I'll be your friend :=)
so is no one going to ask about the guy in the hood!!!!!
Psywave if it makes you feel any better, dealing with the Ads means your still technically contributed to Cruncyroll financially. Meaning they can continue to bring us great anime.
*Cough* Adblock Plus *Cough*
The demon reminded me of Silent Hill.
I hate that dumb girl with the ugly purple hair. >:C
Does anyone else really like the intro.
Really good OP. Short answer: Yes
