Kenpachi's battle was supposed to be short like that. It was supposed to show the overwhelming difference in power. Its honestly refreshing as most fights in bleach take absurdly too long.
He lost because his hair did not grow out everyone knows in Bleach like Dragonball Z the longer the hair the more powerful you are
kenpachi is a fruit ninja master.
Take out the time they spend talking bout how unstoppable their power is, and the battles are actually short. I like it either way though
@autumnstorm10 yeah...except he slices up the itouch/kinect.
"Its honestly refreshing as most fights in bleach take absurdly too long." What anime are you watching? Fights in Bleach are some of the quickest fights when compared to almost any other action anime. Usually a lot going at once, but fast.
No recap. Intro over 1:30.
Thanks.
sweet!
Wow, Renji is badass now
i knowww! xD
i give renji button of sword attack a 10 out of 10 attack score board jk
lol Byakuya "Come at me" I had the instinct to say Bro! after that (-_-)
i thought i was the only one rofl xD
Finally renji has that bad ass tune playing for him in the background.
" A man who lays a hand on a women is scum; Living as scum is the same as being dead. "
Was it just me or was Renji more kick butt then normal ?
Bro everyone was feeling that on Renji. I was upset because I always wanted him and Ikkaku to become the next 2 captains but its a loss cause atm.
same with byakuya
Why was I ready for Ikkaku to do his lucky dance when he said he was the luckiest guy in soul society?
Never mess with a Shinigami. Silly, silly people.

how is that a spoiler
It's better to be careful
Anyone notice Jackie's crotch not getting dirty?

Lol byakuya: Come at me bro
All the Soul Society captains look so serious and focused. =D
I wish we could say the same about Toushiro thats his normal face.
DAMN...Renji gotten strong!!! he looks deadly with that look on his face!!! and by the way where the hell is Kon at he disappeared all of a sudden.
he is in soul society
Damn, did this remind anyone else of the really old seasons?? It gave me like a soul society arc feel. Keep it up!
They're all like "Come at me" In my head I'm thinking "bro"
Oh Kenpachi, your so strong, Toshiro is so cool and spicy, Rengi is such a gentleman, Rukia is so adorable, IIkaku is so awesome with that shiny head of his, Byakuya is so...I need another word other than emotionless. Admirable or great?

is it just me or does the intro theme seem more orchestrated the further into the arch?
Rukia you idiot, I love you Riruko! AND ALL THESE FIGHTS!!!!!! Lol, Humans, why we be so stupid when we get a tad bit of a power rush? you can't all be an Ichgo
I'm watching the opening nd I an't help but cry because im only 3 episodes away from the very end T___T I DONT WANNA READ THE MANGA! I WANT THE ANIME BACK ;A; -cryyy-
