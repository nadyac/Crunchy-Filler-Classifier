RECAP ENDS 3:20
THANK YOU!! These seem to have been getting lost in comments the past dozen or so episodes.
Everyone's all concerned about beating their opposites, and meanwhile Kenny's just having the time of his life.
I was laughing at his fights the whole time.. Everyone is talking, and he just jumps in swinging
you want to destroy soul society? how original.
They could done a better job on the sound Ichigo's hollow form makes. It sounds like a koala with rabies
agreed!
HAHAHA!

hehe the end. Hollow Ichigo jumps through a fire hoop
I miss Grimmjow, I want him to make a comeback already!
I agree to join ichigo's side and ulqiorra also nell they need them

poor ulquiorra
Remember, this is only Hollow Ichigo, not Bankia Hollow Ichigo - note the lack of bull horns.
hey dude until he grabs his bull by the horns i don't think we'll see Hollow Bankai ichigo again
hope we do this is sad good guys are getting owned
Good guys getting owned? Well welcome to 95% of the episodes in Bleach 10 episodes getting kicked to the curb, then one episode of them turning it around :p
Wouldn't that be 90% of the episodes, then? o_O
the reason all these evil people appear? soul society is full of assholes who treat them bad. oh, also central 46
i know it comes every week, but those words,"To Be Continued..." really suck!
I thought at least Ouma had something more intriguing planned out other than the same old "destroy Soul Society", but I guess not. But I am getting tired of Ichigo being so weak through this whole arc! He does look like Godzilla, though.
Dude....(though fake) Unohana laughing maniacally.....creepy. Now I've seen everything.

Ive just noticed wheres kenpachis sidekick the girl with the pink hair?
Why didn't he just make 5 copies of each captain? xD
i never get tired of the songs. i hope they continue to bring back characters, i'd die of happiness if the viserds & some of the arrancar come back. AKA: nel, grimmjow, shinji, hiyori.
i miss Ulqiorra...
plus Grimmjow and nel
Another Abosolutly Useless Episode
Yeah Unohana fucking scares the shit out of me, also everyone gets to Ichigo and they see he is a hollow and they dont say anything......nonsense.....??
like usual i think they saw him and just went '' ( in sarcastic way ) ichigo why oh why are you hollowfying and stuff....'' and then they just take on the inaba dude but i'm surprised too they can tell the girl in the dude but not hollow...
I think Kageroza's missing out on the simple fact that Friendship is Magic.
Kisuke vs. Kisuke, kido battle of the century.
for the first time in bleach history, someones actually working as a team! lol
Does frickin everyone want to destroy the soul society or what?
yeah I guess they do so generic I know
The last filler episode is 342.
