Oh god, Hiro.... How could you? It was your idea too!
I for one, think that the chibi chars at the ed are nothing but genius, and then they added Jonathan n his buddies!, i was like, just take my five starts damn it! N, Jayke, isn't this an anime adaptation from manga to anime??
He wrote "don't panic" on the schedule so yeah, I'm sure he panicked the night before. I honestly thought she'd become sick before the date and miss it.
Dude, i would probably fall asleep if it were a movie about an rv and the desert
ummm.. she put the crutch on the wrong side. its not supporting her other foot if its on the side of her good leg -.-
@LostRedemption: That's what I was thinking throughout that whole scene, lol. And if her ankle was sprained bad enough to need a crutch and a cast then she shouldn't be able to put any weight on it: hurts too much~

It seems like the show is using and subverting these tropes to reinforce the fragility of life. Feels like everyone's constantly walking on glass, which is weird because the show is otherwise so very mellow.
ya i was thinking that to
I thought it that way too but then I figured maybe it implies the destruction on friendship instead since it's so omnious
After I finished watching Another, I thought the same thing like oh crap, random train incoming
Saaaaame
Um, am I the only one who noticed this? At 4:12, she sprained her right ankle, yet she's using the crutches to support her left ankle.. So it's no surprise why she's having so much trouble getting around.
lol ur not the only one
I work in nursing, I noticed she had it on the wrong side before she even stood up. How did she even make it to the waiting room?
If you think about it... She's there with Yuki, who she likes... A good chance to get closer to him ;3
I'm rolling my eyes throughout the entire episode. I suddenly find every character to be infuriating especially Touko.
I know what you mean by 'infuriating', but I'm really hoping that there will be a more captivating backstory aiyaa
Because Touko is always drawing weird pictures of what her friends lives are like. What kind of friend always runs away from her friends when she sees them?
I don't know, I think Yuki is handling things pretty well. He confessed, got rejected but tried to be friends. Failing, he was honest and left. No "win her over" business, which is refreshing. He's just respecting her decision and moving on
Christina, that's always a problem for Americans who watch Japanese anime. The whole social ineptitude/shyness stereotype. It's infuriating, but a tool to draw out a series and keep you dangling. I doubt it's quite that bad in RL for them!
Wait why? I know there's nothing particularly special about this anime's plot, but I'm enjoying the love square and the portents.
so... is this like a love square? and dammit Hiro, I was rooting for you getting the nerdy girl, but oh well, you screwed that one up xD
He doesn't seem like the kind of guy to sustain an interest in books. If they went out, I don't think it would last. But who knows.
I don't think an interest in books would really be the make it or break it factor. His biggest problem will be the fact that Sacchan is into women.
And Tsumugu strikes again, stealing b*tches since chisaki 2014
Love is so complicated in real life and in anime...what am I saying anime is real life...lol
Really? I thought love in real life is more complicated and anime is much easier.
I feel RL love is so much less cut-and-dry than anime makes it appear. But then again, manga and anime can't shine the spotlight "everywhere" so they have to decide on their focus. I don't think I was ever as "aware" as anime shows it to be
Glasslip apparently takes place in a town known for it's unfortunate run-ins with bad timing.
It's a technique they use to create drama, but it annoys the crap out of me. But at the same time, if they come back right away in the next episode and clear up the misunderstanding, that's fine. I think Tari Tari did it that way.
@RookiezIsPunkd between your name and avatar I can say one thing for sure, I like you.
Yuki gets down to give Yana a piggyback ride. Old man walking out of the hospital smiles.

He smiled because he was thinking, "A few times doing that and you're going to regret it, sonny. I should know!"
Jonathan my love..You came back ! ;3
What's with the downvoting festival? This is getting to be beyond annoying. Just do away with the thumbs down option. Please...
The point DrahcirLXIV is making is that if you just stop caring about how many up votes you have then the down-voting simply doesn't matter. As for this series, it's very, very, bland right now, even for a slice-of-life style show.
The point Drahcir was making was that the people downvoting just had a different opinion than the comment, but that's not the case. They're just downvoting because they're sad and have nothing better to do. It's nothing about opinions.
I think there's a handful out there who are insecure about themselves and think that if they capture "attention" by having a post with more hit counts -- hence their desire to down-vote all others -- they will appear better. It's sad really
It's only one downvote per person per comment, so who cares? Downvoting is really useful for hiding spoilers, so I don't ever want it to see it removed.
You just have to learn to ignore them, responding gives them what they crave, attention.
It took another 3 episodes but the Main character of GlassLip is here! Welcome back Jonathan!
Great... I have the same name as a chicken.

ALL THE DOWNVOTES!!! Seriously, though. Who are these people with nothing better to do than downvote comments?
You thought that Touko was the main characters, but it is I, DIOOOO!!!!
i'm curious of where Johnathan is in the love decagon
Why is every comment down-voted? Am i missing something here? Anyways, the story is beginning to get confusing..
Thank God - I'm so happy to know that I'm not the only one who thinks that it's getting confusing!
anime is suppose to be confusing if it made sense there wouldnt be anythign fun to watch
C'mon Hiro! You took her on a date and then you fall asleep? -10 points right there! And then of course Touko walks in on Okikura and Yanagi at the worst possible time. I hope all that gets cleared up....
Finally... the chickens are back... This is the reason i started watching this anime
"Date with Sachi, you've got this!" Falls asleep during the movie. So close Hiro... so close...
At least Sachi seemed to be into the movie. The date wasn't a total loss.

but she shouldnt be into the movie, she should be into Hiro so the date was a total loss lol
Isn't Sachi a yuri character?.. or did I misunderstand her comments in previous episodes...
We don't know yet. She said she got the pendant from someone she loved -- whether romantic love was implied is unclear. She could simply not care for that sort of relationship and only want the best for Touko. But, you know. Shippers.
Oh no, the love triangle, pentagon, hexagon, whatever is getting more complex! The only way to solve this is to kill off all the characters except 2, and those two will get together. :3


I ship Jonathan with another chicken.
This is Nagi no Asukara all over again. -_-
more like Shinsekai Yori XD
You know Yana-chan... That crutch is supposed to be on the INJURED side ._.


It seems like it but according to RICE, the R is for Rest and "... If you use a cane or one crutch for an ankle injury, use it on the uninjured side to help you lean away and relieve weight on the injured ankle."
That's actually not true. A common misconception.
It depends on the injury. It must be used on the injured side when "no weight" can be placed on the injury and the crutch must be used to literally replace the leg. As was the case for me - I could not bear any weight for three months.
Oh boy, the misunderstanding flags are flying high in the air right now.
"Slice of life" anime thrive on misunderstandings. That's life right? Being afraid of women and misunderstanding everything?

@PhantomGundam, That word, I don't think you know what it means. Netorare is literally the bane of any happy person's existence, its sole reason is to disgust you. It is pure evil. I can't say the true def. here because well this isnt 18+
