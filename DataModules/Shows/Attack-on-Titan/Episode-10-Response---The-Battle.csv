Finally, A level headed leader. Was wondering if they existed!
stupid meth commander
if you are a soldier first than, you do all the killing and raping. you have to a human first than soldier second.
Since when were soldiers rapist?
rape is very common in war.
Yep.
Mikasa! "Eren, stop monologing"
Hahaha that was great
I haven't seen 20 seconds take that much time since Dragon Ball Z.
IKR @volley15; 120min = 3minutes ?!>!
@Shantanu: volley exaggerated a bit, but there was one episode in which only 30 seconds passed, another barely a minute, and several episodes where only a couple minutes take place. Also, one fight is 30 seconds, but takes an 1 and 1/2 eps.
and hunter x hunter
hunter x hunter only takes forever with fights because we see what everyone else remotely aware it is happening are doing. And that was honestly only the invasion arc. Otherwise the fights are brief. Remember how long Gotoh's fight took?
you got to remember the theory of relativity the faster you go everything around you gos slower so with goku going as fast as he is and how long he fights is no wonder the fights seem longer than they are when it takes 50 eps to complete
I haven't fallen to the manga yet so I can resist...one...more...week...AAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Good luck! Show them that height and being gender-less are nothing in the face of true love!
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh...*cough*pervs*cough*
If I was gay I probably would do Erin's titan form.
haha
lol
My respect for Armin has grown quite a bit after this episode.
Dude, that was Armin's most epic part as far as I know. While it wasn't a speech that would make me call him a genius, it was REAL and full of emotion. Don't know many animes that make speeches like that NOT cheesy.
@bensonc120 What did you expect the kid to say when he's got a cannon controlled by an insane commander pointed directly at him and his friends? An inspiring speech from Braveheart?
Eren's got two of the best friends ever.
IMO Armin redeemed himself the episode after Eren got eaten. He saw his lack of prowess in battle and was willing to give his gear to someone he believed could make a difference. He's my favorite character in this show.
Armin really grows throughout the series. He becomes one of my favorite anime characters of all time, to be honest. I think he's underrated ^_^
Pixis is such a badass.
Ah, my mistake. Wait. Doesn't that mean that we're supposed to be in the year 2850 right now?
well since it didn't actually happen maybe it's 850 BC? or perhaps it's a different calender?
I'm thinking this happens sometime in the future. 850 might mean the 850th year after the Titans emerged & almost wiped out humanity. If Titans attacked us rn, humanity would be on the brink of extinction & would start a new era.

Of course that's just my take on it. I mean if Mikasa is the last surviving Asian how is this in the past when we have so many Asian ethnicities? Maybe there are more Asian deeper w/in the walled cities that we haven't seen yet. Idk.
I like how the bearded guy is hated to much that we refuse to use his name. Fuck that guy
He has a name? >.>
I thought his name was Meth Commander. XD
Captain Crackhead just won't listen to reason, dude's high on crack. Hurray for Pixis!
It starts now Attack On Titan!!! 0_0 ... who else counted down
I had been counting down since i woke up this morning :) Sadly, I was working, so my countdown had to be longer than yours
yumehoshi87 same here
I'm already counting down for tomorrow
@Yumehoshi87 I like your avatar....
*Guy* "I want to die!" *Micheil* "No! Don't! See?! Sasha is just as scared as everyone else, but she's holding up great! A real trooper!" *Sasha* "ARRRRG! I have a terrible stomach ache! May I go join the wounded?!" LOLOL HAHAHAHA!!
One of the least eventful episodes thus far and it's still freaking epic.
[This comment has been removed]
But what about how Sasha reacted!? That she should be considered one of the casualties... Lol
I agree lol Even the less action packed episodes are still a thrill to watch. I don't think Ive experienced that before with a show
Anybody else wish these were 45 min long
Bensonc this is not a filler.
This and Hunter.
[This comment has been removed]
@bensonc120 then 5 minutes of outro and intro XD
Even if it were 45 minutes, it'd still be 15 seconds.
Salute! Armin Arlert style! Wow I really felt his intense conviction there. The people behind the animation and voice over are doing a hell of a job.
Yes! The production quality and unique art compliment the story well.
That music and speech almost had me in tears.
i love how they show the intensity of his delivery with the racing lines screaming past his bulging eyes and then in the next shot they show him as a little blonde boy again...
This series has an instant "anxiety on" button like no other series I've watched in a long time! Armin...what a speech!!!! <3
These are WAY too short. I start the episode then it is over!!!!
It just because its so good
This and bacon makes a great time.
Almost anything and bacon makes a great time. This just makes it that much better.
Don't tell me she watches Oreimo? Sorry, bad joke there.
My Little Sisters Can't Love Bacon This Much! <--Me making breakfast for twins

I wish i had imouto :<
makes me wonder if their generals were all just drinking and playing chess the whole 100 years of peace and inspections of titans outside their walls...
lol checkmate
*General flips chess table* NOT TRUE
All the haters who say Armin pretty much does nothing the whole entire show. Now would be an appropriate time to eat your words.

Ya, but he stalled them long enough for him to come.
And it was Armin's conviction that helped convince the commander as well.
And just like that its over back to waiting
if you skip this intro to get to the show faster...your doing it wrong
yep the show is like a fine wine meant to be savored.
I only listen to the intros/outros a few times and then i always skip them all.... (anime marathon runner habit)
Yeah even a favourite song is... enough... 26 times in one day.
Screw you guys! I NEVER get tired of that opening! I listen to it DOZENS of times before my martial arts class, because Eye of the Tiger PALES in comparison!
When marathoning episodes, yeah, it's fine to skip. When you have to wait a week between episodes, though, that opening just gets you super hyped.

All i keep thinking after that last ep is you dont want to get eren angry... you wont like it when hes angry lol! i mean im not the only one who noticed it right? He turns into a even crazier monster then the hulk though but without green.
lol yeah remember the hulk eats bullets he would gladly do the same thing he did to the bad god in avengers smash him around
The thing is, Eren has a height advantage, and is more combat-savvy, AND has the regeneration thing that Hulk has.

He's just all rolled up into one little ball of seething rage haha. Eren is basically the Punisher + the Hulk... P: And you gotta love him for it.
