I'm sorry but that grenade hug is still too cute.
When I was in Boot Camp, in the Marine Corps, our drill instructor told us a story about a recruit who tried to kill his drill instructor at the grenade range by stuffing a grenade down the instructor's shirt. The instructor hugged him too.
it the best part of ggo
KAWAII!!!~ <3
"Banzai" is a Japanese cheer that can be translates as "Long life!" or "Hurrah!" It is usually repeated three times to express enthusiasm, celebrate a victory, applause and favor on happy occasion while raising both arms. It is commonly don
SO KAWAII!!
i still think death gun is only "half the man" he used to be
i think death gun is a cut above the rest
these puns are hurting my soul...

[This comment has been removed]
But not as much as death guns soul witch he doesn't have a soul cause he's a robo skeleton dude. I'm sorry I was just trying to pun something up here... totally backfired. like a gun! ugh whatever.
I feel cheated this week :/
let's just all hope that mother's rosario is going to be amazing
Well at least it was not an 80 minute recap this time.......just saying
well it was two seasons they recapped last time.
Maybe there's some foreign country where this won't be shown until season 3, after a sixth month gap, or whatever. Otherwise makes no sense, although the grenade hug did deserve a replay.
at least its not the endless 8.
There was so many explainer episodes this season we dont really need a recap >.>
this .5 episode sucked. just wanted more story nit a recap,
If Shinkawa Kyouji was really craving for some Asada-san, he should definitely get a burrito.
They have digital recorders in Japan. Remember, last episode was also about half recap. There is the starting recap every episode, plus all the flashbacks. We're lucky if we got 12 minutes of fresh video per show, on average.
I see what you did there Keller
Carne.... ASADA SAN! Carne ASADA SAN! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Carne Asada! Taco...
Grenade Hug!
The best kind of hug.
Nearly as good as berries
OHOHO I see what u did there Emooly. Hunger Games reference?
Shino watches 2 much naruto. Trying to be like a girly Deidara.
When they showed the opening with previous episodes I was like yeah no summary but then leave it to SAO to troll you. Tho it was nice to see how it all started with conflicted sinon and ended with lovely sinon.
I agree but at lest they called it episode 14.5. So it was kind of expected.
That and the episode title
But i thought "Debriefing" would be like an explanation of the next mission/plot. "Recap" would've been a better title
@socklee416 Debriefing is an explanation of what happened on the mission that one has just returned from. An explanation of the *next* mission/plot would simply be a Briefing.
And so ends the first arc. It was an amazing journey. I am sad that it is over, but it is comforting to know there is another arc to look forward to. Let's hope it is as amazing as the first (:
sigh... i was hoping it was going to be a new episode nope just a debrief.
To answer some questions first- SAO started as a web series that wassnt compiled into LNs till later second-there are about two arcs away from where the LN is, but the latest arc is super long! third-I think this next episode might (cont.)
be one of the filler stories *no spoiler* kind of like lizbet's and silica's stories. fourth- Check out baka-tsuki if they still have SAO LN (i heard they were going to delete theirs when the official trans from the publ came out (Outrun)
@GTGizra there is sub that have translated them they do have official ones but they are taking for ever to release then in english http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sword_Art_Onl
From the way johnny was talking... it is hard to tell if it's actually filler, if next episode really is that. Filler is something that wasn't included in the manga/original iteration of a piece of work, typically to extend anime airings.
Recaps are nice but why must they replace an episode...
Yeah this isn't replacing anything. There will still be 24 episodes.
i think its obvious the point being made here is that there is no new episode this week, he doesnt think its taking away an episode from the series
The producer also already stated that the air dates for 15 were pushed back anyways with or without 14.5

reason why its 14.5 instead of 15 bud
I've never seen someone explode after being cut into pieces, probably Michael Bay did some shit in Japan.
Sinon, just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled her trigger, now he's dead. Sinon, life had just begun, But you're most welcome to Kirito's Harem.
Nice, subtle
EXXXX....CARIBURRRR!!!!!!!!!!
Fools!

how many volumes of Sword Art Online are there? or is the manga called something different
Well. There are 14 Light novels in Japan, But so far Yen Press has gotton 2 translated with 1 more on the way, The Manga adaptation is of the same name
Scratch that 14 & make it 15
*cough*Caliber was more of a filler,imo *cough* Check out BakaTsuki for fan translations, if it hasnt been taken down due to the official ones release (They're actually really legit) or taptaptaptaptap(dot)net
i have up to novel 11 on my kindle but beaned that there not complete novels yet of 12 and up.
For a recap, that wasn't too bad.
I don't get why people are complaining, sure its a recap meaning an episode lost but hey they showed all Sinon badass moments and that cute grenade hug suicide. Any sinon fan would dig that
Your assumption was everyone is a Sinon fan. I don't dislike her and I can accept recap episodes, but some of the clips they picked didn't work well on their own, and ended up underscoring some of the downsides of the show. ^^'
No episode is lost, baka
It's nice we don't lose a episode but have to wait one week for the next one X_X
Its FILLER RECAP. No one ever likes filler (not OVA, not side plot), and doubly no one likes recap. So no one likes this episode. If I want to relive an epi, I can go find that epi. Nonetheless, SOMETIMES they put import. shit at the end...
Next episode release was delayed, "Here's a recap of the events so far, enjoy it or skip it if you please~!" Would you rather they had just given nothing, maybe you would. Remembering this is a tv show in Japan, people can miss episodes.
I don't understand why people are up in arms over this "Episode." The title "Debriefing" and that fact that it was a .5 episode made it painfully clear to me that this wasn't a 'real' episode. People need to learn observation skills.
In memory of the amazing Pale Rider, you had little screen time only due to your elitism being too much that it would outshine Kirito. RIP
Good thing they recapped, I almost forgot what happened one episode ago...
Well Recap episode... at least this had the present grennade scene in it. That will always make my day really^^
Did any one else notice the poor sub when shinon says "But I wrong"? at 21:03
I swear if there were no "recap" and "flashback" episodes in all of anime, we would have a total of 100 episodes across all anime.
You've clearly not heard of Naruto or Bleach. They alone must contribute to 95% of all 'anime' episodes in existence. I'd say filler is about 10% of anime, 30-50% is more like American TV. One of the reasons I don't watch that crap.
I was clearly making an over exaggerated joke. I guess some people didn't get it.
I like how he says Naruto and Bleach make up 95% of all anime episodes, when there are anime that have run longer than either. No? Gintama. One Piece. Both have ran longer than Bleach, probably Naruto, but I don't care *that* much to check.
