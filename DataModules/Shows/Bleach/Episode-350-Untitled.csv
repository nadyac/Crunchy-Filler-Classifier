"I've already placed it inside of her. There's no reason for further contact"-PIMP
Recap ends at 2:35
We all know why Urahara likes cats so much, specially that black one he picked up. Cuz theres another special Cat that comes by every now and then. who magically turns into a dark skinned, big breasted, purple haired smoking hot babe
He thought, that by sheer coicidence, he could find more cats that could do that But that's his little secret.
him to?
"There is a shortage of perfect breasts in the world. Would be a pity to damage yours"
Why are the bad guys always hiding things in girls bodies?!?!?!?!!??!?!?!!??!?!?!?!?!!???!?!?!!!!?!?!
haha idk.. no but really that tsukishima guy didn't just put it in inoue- he got ishida too that's why sado and ichigo are the ones left
he didn't hide anything in her body, it's part of his skill. and ishida was actually cut, so it's different for him.
Ok, seriously Ichigo? Thinking Urahara is your enemy?? He's only helped you immensely for over 300 episodes!
Serious @ Trust issues.
Yah I hate this part too!
Well to be fair, you could argue Urahara only helped Ichigo because he needed to retrieve Rukia who had the hogyoku inside of her.
yeah but he also helped out Ichigo numerous time after that too. It was so hard to watch ichigo questioned himself about Urahara.
why, just why. let's trust a perfect stranger instead who obviously manipulated you into joining by attacking your friends and making you question your bonds
Must..see...Ichigo...get...awesome...powers
Ichigo! How can you doubt your dad, who raised you and spent 3 months, between Karakura & Soul Society, with you, while you trained, or Urahara, who's a jerk, but always had your back, for some new guy you barely know?
I don't think he's doubting his dad really. He's doubting Urahara. Which he has reason to. Remember how he placed the hogyoku inside rukia? And how he trained Ichigo only so he could save Rukia for the purpose of retrieving the hogyoku?
Why does Tsukishima remind me of Aizen? Just on a different level than Aizen? Like his twin similar ego! But different power and eriness of evil...! Now she is shocked by her not being dead....! Whoa...whats going on? Lol..."one more!" "no"
He also reminds me of Espada 1
Which Ones That?
the gun guy who shot cero from his guns
best character in Bleach Kisuke Urahara & looooool at the end
For anyone not in the know, cat cafes are places in Japan where people can go play with cats. This might seem weird but many apartments in Japan don't allow pets. So this is a way for people to enjoy a cat without having to take one home!
hmm. interesting
Kisuke? Your enemy? I think Ichigo's losing it..
no but there is something suspicious going on w kisuke n how hes always helping ichigo.. i think that in a way, kisuke was using ichigo for his own personal reasons- u know how he said he "owes" ichigo alot?
Well, Ichigo did kinda save the world. With the help of others, of course, but he played a major role. And yes, there's a point in this arc when he nearly goes mental.
thoughtify1210 has a point. If you think back on it. All of that Kisuke helped Ichigo with, has helped Kisuke in some way, even if it's just to correct errors, such as the Hogyoku incident.
wonder what rukia is doing
Nice, finally moving along with Tsukishima's epic plot-twisting ability... And lol at Shishigawara's epic sneeze when Orihime mentioned him. xD
It's so great when Inoue actually talks in this arc, as opposed to the last one. Ya know, when the only thing she could say was, "Kurosaki-kun". Over, and over, and over, and over, and over.....
omg kisuke and his cats LOLOLOL
Who Doesn't Love a Good Neko-Chan
The whole lying to your friends thing is really lame.
Actually, I like this better. It's more realistic than the whole cheesy power of friendship crap. It adds some legitimate tension and depth to the characters. The whole tone the show has taken is really refreshing and enthralling.
I wonder how Ichigo knew Orihime's Room by heart...
he stalks her lol
I thought it was the other way around... Remember kids, if a girl is stalking you, as long as she's hot it's okay haha
just imagin if ichigo had never lost his powers hed be so over powered hed just take out any of these guys causing trouble in his sleep
Actually imagine if the Final Gesugatensho didn't drain him of his powers but just kept him at full power all the time... yeah, there goes his normal like haha, but on the bright side with that kind of power he could become head captain.
@ Grabithot D= WHAT DID INNOUE DO TO YOU THAT YOU HATE HER SO?!?
