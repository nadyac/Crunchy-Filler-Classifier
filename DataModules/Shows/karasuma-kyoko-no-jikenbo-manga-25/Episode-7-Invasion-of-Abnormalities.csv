"Another abnormality bites the dust" I lol'ed at that.
If you just accept two voice actors should never have been cast in their role without more triaing, then the only issue is how short the episodes and series is. The concept, story, location and art work are all stella. 10/10.
Another display of superhuman abilities on Kyoko's part )and she doesn't seem to notice?). A revelation of the super-secret past of her otherwise pleasant boss. Another interesting episode slightly marred by less than excellent voice overs.
