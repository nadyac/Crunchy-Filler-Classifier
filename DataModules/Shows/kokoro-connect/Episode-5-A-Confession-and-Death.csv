That's the least of it; "That was still a dick move Hearseed!"
I can't be the only one who likes that guy.
he's a good character
Inaban's laug at the end! xD
XD
Inban is just scarier then anything period when she laughs. Kinda reminds me of Kill La Kill's main character
hahaha gotta love Inaban's laugh =) scary in a good way
Somehow she reminds me of Golden Time's version of Nana

FISH AND BLOODY CRACKERS D: my feelings feel like they've been killed with a brick. Heartseed is the worlds biggest tuna._. ugh.
GOD ik right! I so wanted to kill Heartseed at first, but then I'm like, it pains me to say this, but he's got a point xD
LOL U guys got actually trolled by the plot turning twist. I might too.
lol he just might be the god of trolls
My feels... because of Heartseed... omg lol
Also, just wanted to say that I love Taichi more and more with each episode. He's great. And, as a side note, I wonder what Aoki's thing is going to be. I feel like he has kind of been left out of the character development circle.
izayas words of wisdom
I wouldn't say that's entirely true William. A good example is the Sunohara siblings and their ark in Clannad. Sure it's a lot of the sister doing the work but the entire ark is the relationship between two bros and he seems pretty popular.
Late to the party, but I don't agree with William either. I find a lot of guys like characters that are also guys and want to see them develop. Guys enjoy guy character developments in films, games, TV shows, so why would anime not apply?
Oran Host Club, just throwing that out there
Magi as well, even though i guess Alibaba and Aliddan can both be considered main characters

What can I say besides... ALL MY FEELS.

The voice actors in this anime deserve an award. More than one actually! I'm not an actor, but my educated guess is that it's extremely difficult to keep switching character personalities all the time as they do here. Quite impressive!


Nice description Crunchyroll!
True, not exactly very spoiler free, are they?
I root for TaichiXInaban! Their cuter
Yup
oh good i thought it was kinda mean for rooting for TaichiXInaban. Especially right after heartseed came into play again
My heart is connected already.. That was a low low blow..
A champion among trolls.
.... Heartseed.... troll.
crunchyroll, rewrite the description NOW!
To be fair, the title's just as bad, and that wasn't Crunchyroll's fault.
did you see he end of last episode you could see her falling off
Such a good episode. On the edge of my seat for most of it!
Inaba's such a good girl.. ;~;
