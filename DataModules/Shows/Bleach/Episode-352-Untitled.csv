recap ends at 3:42
Spot on. Thank you kimmicoa.
there are to many op people in this show but man it pulls u in that how great it is
XD
Thanks but no thanks, I wanna listen to the op
Oh man! If I got a dollar for every time Ichigo made a room full of people put on the "holy shit" face, i'd have CR paid for life!
lol My first reaction was "oh shit"!!!!
He levelled up, I mean he went from white belt to yellow *har har har har*
so, how does ichigo's white-ish pants stay white-ish while fighting in mud?
Good use of Bleach....you set up for that one ...right? ^_^
This here... This... Is brilliant! I hope he did set that one up, but seriously, thanks for making my day you two
About time! I was getting tired of watching him sling that plus sign around
anyone who was saying the fullbring arc sucked, you guys can eat this episode!


Well... you gave me hope... then I read the line "My Dirty Boots are getting dirty. The dirtier they get the stronger I become " I still like the anime but some of the logic, loop holes, etc. kind of ruin it a little...
I mean it doesn't suck, but compared to the Soul Society and Arrancar arcs... It's not that great for a canon arc. (All of the filler arcs completely suck of course, although the mod soul one was mildly entertaining)
damn Ichigo always looks so good
HOLY FUKIN SHIT!!!!!! I JUST SERIOUSLY JIZZED MYSELF AT THE END OF THAT
I don't think that's a good thing but heck I almost did o_o
the fullbring powers remind me of degrayman. dirty boot/ dark boots.
I thought it sounded familiar! I forgot all about Lenalee's dark boots from D. Gray-man, but you're right, they do remind me of her dark boots.
RAWR. Hakusho made of black flames. Wicked!
ichigo always so damn sexy
Jackie's boobs get bigger when she use Dirty Boots
ichigo allways a way to look cool and be bad ass at the same time.
Your mom has dirty boots..... >_>
O.o ICHIGO CRUSH ME!
I was thinking the same thing!! Haha
Don't give us unnecessary flashbacks of things that just recently occurred. The audience knows, and I know you're just filling up an episode.
Jesus that outro is ruining my life!!
@pewpew3: SPOILER TAGS! USE THEM!
haha, i don't know but i liked it better when he was a shinigami....
By now, I'm wondering how many groups Ichigo is gonna join. First, a shinigami, then a hollow/shinigami, then a vizard(same as previous but with more control), and now a fullbringer!! WTF?
