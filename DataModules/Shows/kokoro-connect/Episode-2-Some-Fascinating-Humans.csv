You know, I wouldnt be surprised if one of them started lying about switching bodies to figure out what a person thought about them
It'll be really awkward if they switch and one of them is in the shower.......
agreed
even worse if a girl switched with a guy while tugging it but more importantly would they finish ........
If i swapped and a girl was doing her form of tugging it, I'd 'give her a hand'
it wouldn't be awkward at all. it would be kind of fun
I'd get all jumpy and nervous. Plus, I would prefer to switch with my own gender.
Am I the only one that thinks that that one orange hair girl was either raped or abused as a child? Cuz her reaction when being touched by the opposite sex wan't normal....
I think your onto something Watson...
Well, we only have 11 more episodes to think about it. Eventually the truth will out, especially with that kind of foreshadowing.
your right
Probably just a big red herring!!

"and I'm like, 'Yeah, that was fun,'" HAHHAAHHAAHHAH
looooooooooool
Reminds me of GLaDOS.
Heartseed is the best.
This might be more exciting if i knew the characters more before all this switching
As the characters learn about who they are, so do we.
are there any other soul switching animes out there?
Only the guys and Yui confuse me. I can tell Iori and Inaba from body lang. Iori will jump around whereas Inaba will look downwards and fold her arms. Yui and Taichi are between these extremes and Aoki takes a while to show his perversion.
Whos Yui?
Once a month, this swapping thing is gonna get really awkward for the girls ;P
Wouldn't it be more awkward for the boys who swap into a girl?
It's werird for both genders because girl and boys all have their things if you know what i mean i don't.
They started switching bodies too soon, it's hard to keep track of each character's personalities since we're not used to them in their normal bodies. Should've had 1-2 eps of them being 'normal' first then started switching
i cant even remember who is who yet! D:
i agee w/ @landail
Yeah I agree They it would have been less confusing even a simple episode would have been okay. But i think with this switching it's telling more about them
I forgot character names, name of bodies, and who switched and what not
This may be why the personalities of the people in this are a bit exaggerated seeming. This way we can tell from the personality if we can't quite remember names yet.
...why am i getting the feeling yui got assaulted or something
It's the combination of her adversity to males, her severe reaction about girls being left alone and her obsession with self defense.
Why do I get a felling Himeko is from Sket Dance and why do i get a feeling that shes been through tough stuff
I have a feeling this is going to get complicated.
I like this for one reason. The will all eventually get to be greater friends by switching bodys. Kinda wish I could do this with my friends for some reason.
I like this anime so far it gets more intense with each episode. :3
I love how they hv the preview before the credits!
i know the answer to their question "how long will the body-swapping last?" And the answer is -- one anime season.
Wish it was more though.
This show is turning out to be much more layered and interesting than I'd first thought it'd be. The spine-tingling vibe still persists, and the atmosphere is undercut by this unsettling feeling. Love it.
I had to pause and google who everyone was with pictures
I know right
Oh Sh!t this got real
That was so funny at the very end. I like where this anime is going.
A-B-C! Hahaha! Nice boobs!
This anime is quickly becoming epic. What a great ending to this episode hehe!
nagase is mine ... huh? lol
