Hachiken sure is lucky that Mikage's friends with girls less dense than she is.
I think one reason they might've left out that line though was to continue to leave the relationship between Mikage and Ichiro ambiguous because animes love giving us unsettled relationships.
Hachiken-kun, Ganbari nasai yo!
Yeah, it did seem like they left some stuff out, but the anime is still adapting the manga near-perfectly, so I have no complaints...
GO MIKAGE GO!
its time mikage...TO SMELL THE DANG ROSES!!!XD
I'm always happy, but also a bit ambivalent, when watching this show because dammit Hachiken, you're making me feel like a lazy bastard... especially because I am...
I have a schedule too. An anime schedule.
We are hardworking too though, catching up n waiting for anime to be updated... THAT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK!!
Hey anime schedule is a big commitment, especially on wednesdays.

I see what you did there.
better then being and alcoholic and getting all shit fac...oh. that happened too.
These puns please me
Well, that's a good pun-ishment there no XD?
Quite possibly the greatest "she said yes!" moment in anime
blown so much that he collapsed
^ damn! beat me to it
He was so overcome with a blown brain because she said yes.
That parade was freaking epic. Totally up to par
Someone needs to turn those frames into a gif or something. Because that was frakkin EPIC.
She'll realize it sooner anyways <3
Flower to the face!
It would be really funny if Hachiken turns out to not think of it as a date.
An otaku sled...well, that would certainly grab my attention.
Definitely caught my eye
Kinda hard to miss...what with the loli's on the side.
yup, it grabbed my attention alright!
Sooner or later this will be a real thing. I would be surprised if it isn't already.

Strangely enough, it's probably also because he took a moment to relax. (orthostatic hypotension)
Seriously, DAMMIT! I cannot wait for next week!

That was totally unexpected. Well, I expected it a little, but not to end the episode!
*FAINTS* cue happy music
All those alarm clocks... You know you have a full plate when you're relying on several backups, I laughed and shuddered remembering similar situations.
Hachiken's reaction faces are just priceless.
Yeah, reminds me of Ed's hilarious "don't call me short!" faces xD
Considering the same person who did FMA is the one who did this I'm surprised I didn't notice it before.
wouldn't you call hachiken's blue suit earlier reminiscent of a certain perennially gloved character from FMA?
Always look forward to watching this show!!
At the pace it is going, it looks like this season might catch up to the manga. I think they abridged quite a few manga chapters in this episode too. Very low chance of this getting a s3 any time soon.

Next week gunna be interesting, though hate cliff hangars

I think she was aware of her feeling just no of his. She was holding herself back because she was over thinking things about her families farm being extra baggage.
They changed the tone of the ending song for the cliffhanger. Nice touch.
Yeah, a lot of shows don't do that and it totally throws me off, like the opening to Berserk, waaaaayyyy too up beat for what was going on in the later episodes
Excuse me but... I F**KING LOVE THIS SHOW. Always looking forward to the new episodes
YOU MADE PIGGIES!
...Pork Bowl....*tears*


I hope so, I hope it doesn't affect his date.
"Oh Hachiken, that cow is taking a dumb." That was so hilarious!

Inada is like Opera. Big one day and small the next.

the vice president finally calls the dog vice president
Is HachiMika finally gonna happen!? Can't wait till next ep!! Saw his fainting coming, wonder who will find him. Is it just me or is this a new/different ver. ED?
No it's new. The song is a slightly different style (I think) but the animations are new.
I totally understand what Hachiken is going through with Mikage...the amount of times I've been left second-guessing whether things are dates and the girl knows or she doesn't see my intention at all...*pouts*
More times than not, men and women seem to speak two completely different languages that sound exactly the same but have vastly different meanings! >.<

Hey, it's a Slice-of-Life story. All that running around Hachiken was doing getting things ready was bound to wear him out, bless him.
