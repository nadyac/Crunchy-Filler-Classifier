"Let me make you mad enough to kill me!"
as i ride down a stream on a boat backwards
Mwuhahaha!

Swiggity Swooty He came for her Booty
lol u guys are terrible XD
I wonder what would have happened if Kaoru wasn't there. Would Jinei have just floated past in his little boat, laughing maniacally?
The image is rather ridiculous, that it is.

That was too funny at the end, he has like +100 boat skills to have that kind of balance
Well, at least it's better then the "dark matter" that Gintama's Tae Shimura makes, that stuff will make you loose your memories!
Sound effects of the 90's. Got to love them.
"Kenshin" "Oro!?" "I found you..." 'She's scarier then Jinei, that she is...'
This show is just an incredible classic. I am so glad to have the chance to watch it again. ^_^
its a classic that i can keep watching over and over today..... that and this is probably my favorite samurai anime by far. It has fantasy moves that still have a realm of realism to it even if the moves are far fetched.
In this episode I could clearly notice the difference in Kenshin's voice when he is battle as opposed to the carefree silly one. 0.0
I never really realized how quick moving these character relations moved before.
Great anime brings me back watchin all the good shows on toonami
classic!
GET HER BACK.
You are now aware that Kenshin's scar doesn't move when his jaw does. If I have to suffer, so will everyone else!

look at your man know back at me hes not nearly as evil as me now look back at your man and back to me im on a boat.
kenshin's voice is fucking perfect xD
I just can't get over how much I agree with you... omg.. :')
For some reason "I'm on a Boat" by Lonely Island popped into my head when Kurogasa was floating away
May not be a popular opinion but I like the Dub voice for kenshin better than this one. Either way it's awesome to see these again.
It was a little jarring at first but I think I'm getting used to it. but everyone else's is better subbed ... I HATED Kaoru in the dub ... but she's not so annoying and kind of funny this way
i thought that the dub was very good i dont see why people hate the dub it dos it justices unlike other dubs in the past like: robot hunter casshan and the first vampire hunter D movie i guess peps her got to scared from the Intro dubs
of anime back from the 80s onwards.....i understand it and all and i would rather watch anime introduce to us back in the 80s-very early 90s with subs unless if they do a new dub that dos it right
How is he moving so fast down that river? Its a beautiful day out with barely any wind that i can tell. How is the river fast enough for him to get away from Kenshin.

I never noticed when I watched this as a kid, but now Kenshin having a woman's voice kind of bugs me.
