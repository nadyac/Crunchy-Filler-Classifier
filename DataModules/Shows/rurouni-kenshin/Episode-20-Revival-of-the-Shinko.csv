Worst Shots EVER.

Even back then, the voice of luffy was having trouble swimming...

This may be fiction but still, the government should have kept some swordsman elite squad as opposed to relying on just guns. They are good for long distance attacks only.
Historically the elite squads in both the military and police were sword and gun armed until WWII. Of course, plot convenience has beaten historical accuracy for the last 19 episodes, so why change now?
It's also worth noting that the "screaming your head off and charging into a hail of gunfire" and "stand out in the open in front of the enemy, then unleash an energy blast from your sword" tactics weren't nearly as effective in real life.
How is nobody getting shot? *anime logic*
is the rich kid stupid or what!!!
Those eyebrows, though...
