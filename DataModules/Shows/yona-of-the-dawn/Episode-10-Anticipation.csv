I'm sorry to burst your bubble but its not a blue dragon. Instead its a four-legged thunder beast under closer examination. Did anyone notice that Yona has a sorta phoenix bird instead of a red dragon?
I noticed. It's real cool. She looks cool.
LMFAO i Haven't legitimately laughed like that in awhile.
It was WAYYYYYYY too cute!!! <3
"Our guest has red hair." This clans entire legal system is built around hair colour so it seems. Good thing the kingdom of Kouka doesn't seem to have developed hair dye yet.
If they had developed hair dye, then one would be forced to check the curtains matching the drapes.
@Humanavatar You have officially made my day.
Well that would bust Chaika's disguise, the curtains don't even match the pelmet (her eyebrows).
Ange's match Though, Tusk has mastered the art of Face planting...
irtiza9169 "Anime Original Ending?" - You bite your tongue sir! I pray this never happens!
They don't need an AOE: he belongs in the OP and not every show has to have an evolving OP with characters appearing and disappearing.
Dear lord it just started rolling best be at least 24 epi's
Actually, I have noticed at the part where they're trudging through desert, they are including the current number of people in the group... went up 1 from last episode.
That was the best laugh in anime history. It should win awards. I took like 3 screenshots of that short scene.
Hak had me dying laughing the whole episode

Hak takes the money anyway xD
Hak learned his item gathering skills in JRPGs. Everyone knows you go into other people's houses and take whatever you can find that's inside a treasure chest.
Hak- "Ehh?.... Princess, looks like he's no good after all." I busted out laughing, Hak is the man.
Slowly, Yona builds her precious harem.
@Barghesto- I'll give you Hanasakeru Seishounen, but I refuse to acknowledge that Amnesia is a thing that exists. (Along with essentially all the other reverse harems in 2013 that have been said to exist.)
that Andou harem level is high doe!!!
Kija... he's the best of Yona's precious harem <3
@Wheezy-P: there are A LOT of reverse harem series. This is most definitely not the first... they've always been my guilty pleasure series.
Urg, those "other" reverse harem series sucks like balls even though they are very few compared to harem shows. But this anime is different. Akatsuki no Yona takes all of those trashy reverse harem concepts and burn them into crisps!
Not gonna lie, I was 'Haha'ing with Hak just as well. That was one of the simplest, most entertaining anime scenes I've seen this season. xD
I started to laugh along with him before I even realized that I was even doing it.
You just can't help but be happy for him, after all that aweful sh*t he went through.
I'm so happy to meet Ki-ja! I cant wait to meet the other dragons! (and the chipmunk)
The way this clan loves their dragon is just too cute ^-^ on a different note: being carried around by Hak must be nice. Yona is absolutely right wanting to keep him safe!
This show is so, so, so good.... One of my favorites of the entire year. And I love Hak - no character cracks me up like Hak!
The old lady sounds like your usual grandma or mother. "When are you going to have a wife so I can have some grandchildren?!"
A few wives, you mean. She's not taking any chances.
"Our guest has red hair." I thought they knew something we don't know (like she's the reincarnation of Hiryuu or something along those lines) but nope! They just f**king LOVE red hair!
Well, I can't blame them for loving red hair. Redheads are the best.
haha I would guess they know what red is because of the sky xD haha
"H - How did they know what red looks like?" You can't be serious.
blood...
What with the white hair, and the male-female ratio, I wouldn't mind living in that village..
The pacing of this show is perfect. They take their time with character development without the show ever dragging on. I hope it stays this way and we can get multiple seasons from it c:
That laugh...just killed me
Looks like Hak's got a new rival...yikes.
Yup, Yona already told Ki-ja that he looks beautiful. A complement I don't think Hak will be getting anytime soon. lol
Well, Hak is more the handsome/sexy type...^_^
Lmao, grandma in anime are so awesome these days
She strongly reminds me of the grandmother from Kekkaishi. A tiny, dignified fireball.
Though unfortunately not as badass...At least not on screen.
I am going to miss her.
Ki-Ja and Hak remind me of two other characters named after Tiger and Dragon, who also fought form their first meeting, they ended up..... Oh dear god now I need some mental bleach
Well played sir. Both are great anime. Also mental bleach for everyone on the house
what show?
Toradora. A wonderful romance. Now my turn for the mental bleach.
im assuming toradora
Thank you for that mental image that I did NOT need... Pass me the bleach? No, not the one with the strawberry, the OTHER bleach... *runs away after lame joke*
Come on Ki-Ja be a man and take the girl with you too.
I was half expecting fresh underwear to make it a Pokemon reference, but that was funnier
Your beautifully blazing red hair, wise and lovely eyes, and smooth skin...I regret that you do not have these things. The old lady cracked me up.
lmao! @ ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha happy really happy. and man I love that granny.
this ep was hysterical, especially yona's old lady moment when ki-ja called her pretty! XD
