"I'll cure anyone who's not lovesick!" Could she be talking about Sanosuke?
Lady Megumi is so gorgeous!
Seems like the budget was tripled for this episode?
this would be the start of the second half season, so they could easily have a much larger budget off of the success of the first half season.
Nice observation.
People are so easy to fool. Reminds me of some I know. =3=;
Sad but true example of what faith healing is all about. This sort of thing has gone on for many centuries, well before modern science. While some were honest, the majority saw it as a good way to make money off the ignorant and desperate.
I almost wanted the girl to fall into danger just so the phony would be exposed and the Megumi revive her quickly to clean up her name. xD

I feel like if I were to undergo stitching without modern painkillers, I would be begging someone to ladle sake down my throat.
The new ending is pretty sweet.

This episode is so goofy... the obvious plot would have been to try and exploit the doctor rather than create some faith healing out of no where. Either way I still love RK, but some of the side episodes seem pointless.
they're all wearing the Buddhist swastika for peace ;P
wow he had me fooled with with all that yelling TT'....then turnd out to be a fake zannen deshita.
