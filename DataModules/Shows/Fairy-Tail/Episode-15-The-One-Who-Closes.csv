"Wendy, what about your healing magic?" "With a wound that significant to the plot, there's no way I..."

Actually, this isn't the first time Wendy can't heal someone. It happened during the Tenroujima / S class exam Arc. In episode 106, Wendy wasn't able to heal the wounds Master Makarov got in the battle against Grimoire Heart's Master Hades.
Exactly, Madmax. Wendy can't heal people who have had Zeref's magic used on them, as she couldn't heal Natsu or Makarov, the former being actually hit with it by Zeref, the latter being attacked by someone who could use it.
Wendy doesn't technically heal people she is able to restore their magical energy which causes them to recover faster since they have infused it throughout their bodies. That is why she can't heal such a deep wound.
Either way "the would is too deep" -cant see wound because of cloak- come on wendy, really?

Rie Kugimiya always has been very good at those feels moments.
*Sniff* You w-wimps *Tear roles down face* its not that s-sad T __ T
My initial reaction was, "Hey, don't cry, you've got a spare," but Happy won me over big time. Kick his ass, Natsu!

that voice actor with such raw emotion pushed me from not caring one bit to actually crying. im shocked
You made Natsu angry. Never make Natsu angry.
thats what happens when you mess with his waifu xD
Fear the glowing eyes.
*eye
ANGRY!? BITCH, NEVER MAKE HIM CRY. Never seen him seriously cry before.
YES KIRA YESSSSS
Natsu when mad not a good sign for the other guy .... Natsu super pissed off with a red eye and crying because you killed his friend.. uhm your ashes will not exist...
Second this.
^
She's not just his friend, but it's quite obvious she's his lover.
Aye Sir
Exactly, just how you never say to Gajeel that Natsu is stronger, or like how you never make fun of Gray in front of Juvia, its common Knowledge really

I'm all fired up!

Haha yep, I read ahead on the manga.
Really? Where's my library card, i'm reading ahead!
These episodes just feel soo short! How can I wait a whole week when Fairy Tail is just so incredible?!
One of few series that needs hour episodes to really score big. I feel left waiting all week for the next one!
the shortness feeling is like getting a triple ice cream cone.. put you only get one or two bites.. ;(
What is this.....sweat is coming out through my eyes......
I think it's raining on my eyes....
WHO THE HECK IS CUTTING ONIONS IN HERE


^^ The guy above me. Suck it up and shut up, the word has more than one meaning. You're pathetic for immediately attaching the word retard to someone with special needs. Get a life moron
@ESC074NIDAN the word "retard" has 2 definitions. one of which means "to hold back". Hence the flame "retarded/retardant" cloth. There are break retarders in big rigs (18 wheelers) too.
Most def not even close to the same meaning retard ? a word to describe a certain type of person no mater what race .. the other race specicifc
Its a joke from a movie he clearly wasn't referring to your mentally challenged child c'mon unbelievable... a word means what the person intended it to mean nothing more or nothing less. BTW everyone is equally special, besides Chuck Norris
Leo deserves some gentleman points for that move.

Fortunately for me it wasn't as harsh as when I read it in the manga, but still those are some heavy feels...
two weeks of Feels, i cant hold it, MEN CRY
Want to protect yourself from feels at all times? Tired of pesky onion ninjas? Cry all the tears you'll ever have out with watching Angel Beats! Dry your ducts so fast you never cry again!
@WrittenShadow so true
@WrittenShadow did this. can vouch for a 100% success rate. Haven't cried in 4 years now.

I love how present Rogue looks like such a punk but he's really a softie who loves his cat. C:



man why is the opening song so awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!11
its cool, but i really liked Masayuma chasing a loooooot

I read the wiki...my curiousity sometimes gets the better of me. Strangely I can't seem to ruin fairy tail even if i read spoilers.
It was kind of spoiled in the opening, too.
i'm assuming you guys don't read the manga?
Reading the manga is overrated, but like the assassin I read the wiki page so its much the same. Yay for Dragons!
@ishida617 Aren't almost all Fairy Tail openings spoilers anyways? I remember one opening had spoilers for the next arc while the previous arc was still airing.
oh happy got me right in the feels
Nice profile pic!
We are the champions!
My friends! (Dun Dun) And we'll keep on fighting...to the end
Insert Queens theme song here.
Man, these openings are getting better and better.
I don't think I can wait another week.
YES LOL FAIRY TAIL FRIDAY!
ty fairy tail for saving my money by making me not go out and drink hahaha.
