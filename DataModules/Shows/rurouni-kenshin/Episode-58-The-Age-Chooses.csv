Shishio doesn't seem like a swordmaster, more like a trickmaster.
"Off guard? This is what you call composure!" Such a boss! My only grind with his gunpowder glove is that his hand should be blown to pieces.
he got shot in the head and burned alive and is still moving..i think anything is possible for him :/
Shishio: "I am the strongest! I have beaten all the already half-dead warriors who dared to challenge me! Hahahah!" -_-
"Swordsmen! Come fight me, my flaming sword, my helmet, and my exploding gloves!"


way toooo op
It turns out that Shishio's only weakness is a nerf bat. Or possibly opponents that haven't been beaten half to death before they even reach him.
doesnt the big speech about how the government is weaker than he is annoy you since he only fights people who should be like.... K.O from pain and wounds?

I assume that punch to the metal helmet will come back later.
Someone should tell Shishio that his logic is flawed. Ants haven't flourished because each individual one is incredibly strong...
I have school tomorrow and I should be going to bed...BUT THESE LAST FEW EPISODES WONT LET ME
How exactly does the Guren Kaina not blow off ShiShios whole arm?
Couldn't help but thinking... They are surrounded by petroleum so had Sanosuke been carrying more bombs, they could have all gone down in flames..
Shishio is so cool, he definitely makes my coolest villains list.
methinks the question mark in the episode title gives it away.. i guess we'll see!
I don't care if it would have been a waste, I still wish we could have seen Shishio vs Seijuro.... not even necessarily as part of the story line, but just to showcase just how ungodly strong Seijuro was... do it as an OAV fanservice!



Still not over.
