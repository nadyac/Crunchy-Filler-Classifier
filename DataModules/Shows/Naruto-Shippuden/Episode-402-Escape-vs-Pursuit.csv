Bulat is that u ?

he looks nothing like bulat.. that guy is probably just one of his fan boys
I don't even like Akame ga Kill that much... but even I feel that with filler this bad and characters this weakly designed, that'd have to be an insult to Bulat.
ANIKIIIIIII and true that *****
No, Bulat was actually a cool dude. This guy is just a wannabe.
This is the type of filler I absolutely hate.
i think the fillers this time around was fun, not this episode though, since kiba is meh.
Right? Team 8 gets a bad animation episode AND derps out enought to be made a fool of by the stupidest-looking team, thanks to the nonsense mechanics of that team's skills? The writers had to realize no one wants to see that garbage.
This is about the worst episode of Naruto ever. Seriously? A burp power, a golden shower saved them... where are the clever use of basic tactics, like clones, strings, explosive tags, substitutions, etc?
It was interesting at first because of shikamarus interesting take on the chunnin exam .it was actually intelligent, and now its the same old "I have to do this because naruto is my rival" crap, how many times are they gonna reuse this plot
This filler sounded okay at first just to see how they got to be chunin but now it just seems lazy, even the animation seems so.
Filler is generally bad, but filler focused on Kiba is the worst, awful character still using the same moves from before he was a genin.
I like Kiba! Though you would think he'd come up with something new
I honestly thought that Shino was a strong character that didn't get much development because people didn't like bugs. But it turns out, he sucks too. But Kiba, seriously, he's terrible. Konohamaru would probably kick his ass.
As stated by others, Kiba is most definitely the Yamcha of this show.
I also like Kiba, but like most secondary chars, Kishi stopped developing him... Admittedly, he might be one of the worst cases. When he gets a last minute new move, it's adding a third head to the two headed wolf... doing what, exactly?
And to think Kiba want to be a hokage while using his only move..
I'll be back in 5 years when they return to canon.
I'm with ya there, this filler episode was utter garbage.
Do you type a comment like that after every filler episode? We all know you will watch next week's episode. The fat guy with 4 breasts was entertaining.
This episode wasn't all that great yeah but I like this filler series.
What's the point of filler when the manga is completed??
your optimistic
Worst episode of naruto I have ever seen.
This is the first time i've ever posted. And it's simply to agree with you. This episode sucked harder than any other.
they run out of idea to stall time.
Like Darkprinc said, i think everyone has forgotten about the ninja ostrich
Personally, the mecha Naruto episode was the worst for me.
ive seen worse
Are they planning on doing several episodes for each of the 3 Leaf teams? I seriously hope not
and this is only the second test XO
lol yea this filler is gonna draaaaagggggggg on for at least a few more months shittt
I'm sure the main team is putting shit tons of effort into the main story right now. So I hope this is a long filler so that they have plenty of time to make it as amazing as humanly possible. I can't wait to see how amazing the fights are.
i hope they do. what ya'll complainin for, bitches
So far im ok with it. They have all been good episodes.
Looking at the comments, and the rating... I think it's safe to skip this episode.
why didn't I think of that..

Sorry, but you'll have to wait another 10 years until we get 5-star ratings again.
Its almost like they want us to stop watching Naruto
It's episodes like these that give Naruto a bad name.
Gaaaaaaawd filler animation is TERRIBLE! :( I love fillers, but this one just looks like it had ZERO effort put into it :/
I know right! Looks like everything with into the Lee's fight.
It would have been nice if my favourite character Hinata was in a better team and this episode was a little less pathetic. The last few episode have been infinitely better, Lee makes a much better filler story.

I won't be surprised if the flubby shinobi unleashes a massive fart in the next episode.
This episode was so incredibly shit. I mean, I wasn't expecting much 'cause it's just filler, but fucking hell they didn't even try.
it's a shame team 8's time to shine was kind of ruined by lower quality production values
This was definitely a 'fuck you' episode....
thanks guys for the comments, now lets never speak of this god awful episode again
I guess they let the interns make this one.
The fighting choreography was really bad this episode. Also did that fat guy remind anyone else of Buu?
Wow, this was like...filler for the filler.. holy crap.
