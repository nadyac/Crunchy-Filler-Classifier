I can't wait to see Rin achieve his dream of becoming Hokage... Err wait I mean Paladin.
don't forget cross dresser extraordinaire pako-chan. (gintama)
Hahaha, kind of a mixup there, eh? XD
There is no way that the nine-tailed-fox-demon-boy will be Paladin...
I'm glad I'm not the only one who made that comparison.
i laughed way more than i should have
ITS MOTHRA!!!!!!!!!!
Great, now all we need is Godzilla
Damn moths! WHY YOU BE SO MEAN, HUUH?!
CHUUUUUUUUCHIIIII
Meow hoo? Lmao
Nyan nyan.
... Niisan (Brother) Nissan (Type of car) dafuq is up with the world (I prob got the spelling mixed up but you get it still)



I wanna see a prequel show about Shiro. XD He's such a badass!
LOL!! Yuikio is jealous of Rin and Shiemi!! Shura as a drunk is a RIOT!!!
I know...literally LOL'ed...XD
Shiemi and Okumura-san are an adorable couple!
"boys will pitch the tent and create fire and the girls will cook dinner" wtf yukio?!
I'd be pitching a tent too around Shiemi and Shura
Yukio:: b**** do i even have to say it
Yukio: GET BACK IN THE GODDAMN KITCHEN AND MAKE ME MY SAMMICH, BE-OTCH!
Rin said F that these chicks don't know how to cook. I'll just do it instead
Shiemi...<3
I hope ren and shimi end up together!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You could not have butchered their names any worse.
LOL @Titan_01
Dude these translators! Whenever someone says "nee-san" or "Okumura-san" they just replace it with "Rin" in the captions! It's like.. Im not stupid! I can HEAR them when they're speaking something different than what it reads on the screen!
yea i agree the translators are a little lazy but they do make it simpler for us to read instead of guessing who there talking about sometimes. thank god someone translates it
If you think about it, either way it means the same thing. It could say: "Lets set up camp here." but the translator could put: "Lets stop here for tonight." Either way it means the same thing so I don't see a problem.
Usually I actually prefer it when they translate it into what an Anglophone would say in that situation. To me it usually sounds stilted when anime characters refer to their older siblings as "brother" or something.
And fans who know some Japanese like DaisyPhantom know what's being said anyway. You could say that you lose some information about relationships etc. when you translate that way but to me a natural-sounding translation is more important.
i love this anime so so so much

I don't mind adds because crunchy roll is legal. What bugs me is why do I see the same 3 adds over and over and over again?
Because the companies who make the adds actually have to come to you with offers to pay you for ads. It's the same three because those are the only companies who wanted to advertise on this tube site.
... Ads, not adds. Im sorry. I hate when people don't spell that right. Its simple. (Ads= Advertisements. Adds= Addition)
Get Premium, maii Friends...It's worth it.
Or adblock plus _-_
"Meow Hoo~"
That huge moth in the end reminds me of a boss from a Zelda game.
Team 7
I wonder how much horsepower Rin has? I bet he'd win first place in the tractor pull at the county fair. They don't need an engine. Just Rin.
"Meow hoo." LOL!!!!
MEOW HOO
Drunken Shura is AWESOME! XD "This year she'll be twenty si-" *clunk* "Whoops, my hand slipped." Thats me when someone tries to tell my friend my weight, throw a book at them, my hand slipped.
meow hoo. best line ever!
