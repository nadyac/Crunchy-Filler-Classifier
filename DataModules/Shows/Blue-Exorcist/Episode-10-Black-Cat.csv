I totally love Rin's answers, "I was worried about your second pair of glasses."
lol yes
lol
Why wouldn't they be?
I think his brother is just jealous of him, I use my power too and I wouldn't be letting all these chumps play games with me and make me run around and jump thru hops and sit tight with a babysitter
Glasses are so expensive.. What if his eyes change, and he has to get a new stock of glasses? That's at least $500 in frames (not including lenses), from that drawer alone..
I want a cat that drinks sake
mine eats any and everything that is left untended and some things that are, i once had a pork chop stolen while i was still eating it
My cat was super attached to me. I wouldn't let her eat anything made for humans though. She was very smart. Went up and downstairs with me, lay in my room for hours with me, when i went to sleep was the only time shed go off. Cats>Dogs.
Dogs < Fish < Cats
I have a friend who's cats love spray can cheese
Then your looking for Nyanko-sensei!

TwT So saddddd D:
i cried hard
Darkninja, if you wanna shed a tear, watch Angel Beats.
This episode really touch my heart. This is how everyone must feel when an important family/friend passes. I hope Rin & Kuro can have a great relationship. The old man really was awesome!
WrittenShadow Angel Beats? That doesn't cast a shadow compared to Grave of the Fireflies.
lmfao "i was worried about your second pair of glasses" XD
This episode is a prime example of why anime is the greatest media out there!!!!
agreed
1. OMG HE USED HIS HEAD 2. KURO MADE ME CRY 3. I NEVER KNEW A CAT CAN MAKE ME CRY
lol lol lol XD
Damn, the cat's pain was so sad, it made me want to cry...good episode!
This episode made me cry xD i love Kuro <3
I don't know why, but I always thought that Kuro would have more of a mans voice instead of a lady voice...

YOU NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER...... SMACK THE GLASSES OFF OF A 4 EYED PERSON!!!!!! It is forbidden, me being one >:3
WOOT! drunk cat for the win!
lol. Rin: Then I'll just use my head. Yukio: Huh? *with funny face* -commercial- Me: AHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH (laughing at the face that i only saw for a moment)
Well I was worrying about your second pair of glasses XD and he says it with a straight face. You know it's a good anime when little things like that stick in your mind
I laughed when he said that with a perfectly straight face
What about the glasses miracle xD
The music in this anime is so beautiful I also teared up when Kuro did TT_TT so sad
Kuro like many of us just couldn't deal with the sadness of knowing that a family/best friend had passed without been there to say his/her goodbyes. That's what started the waterworks for me!
i never noticed that cat in the intro before now.
I just kept wondering when they'd introduce the damn cat.
I want Kuro!!!!! :333
I cried so much TT
omg this episode made me cry and I normally don't cry when I watch anything.
omg when kuro started crying i almost cryed myself
