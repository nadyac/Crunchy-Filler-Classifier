daaamn this rustles my jimmies
Buckle your seat belts kiddies, GGO is almost here!
Why can't they get to the underworld arc already >.>
Hopefully they will, Eventually, But without Phantom bullet (GGO) & Mother's Rosario arc. The Alicization arc would leave more to be explained.
I'm hopeful for Mother's Rosario too, just to see that final in-game scene at the end.
I would be happy if this is better than the EO arc. That was kinda garbage.
0:14 ..............u wont regret it!
id just be happy if they made a real mmorpg based off the first season, with 100 levels to beat. picture each boss it doesn't have to be nervegear system!!! just an mmorpg game lol
LOL - that's funny. I actually did a <<REW at it and posted "Too bad they didn't use 00:14 as the capture image for the preview =)" before I saw this comment. ... No Regrets. Beleve it!
Zero episodes into the series and the fanservice has already achieved maximum overdrive. This ought to be good.
ha ha i has to be that last arc ....... well lets not talk about it
funny there actually is a game being developed called Age of Aincrad. go to their website. It is SAO.
So his avitar is a trap
so kirito is desperate for given items that's why he has a female avatar~RPG gamers will know~
@ Heroinbob: Oh, I so hope they do a lot of the side stories in a couple movies. The Excalibur mission would be awesome to see, and I'd love to see Mother's Rosario, but they're too short for a season of their own....
@Heroinbob44: yea, i have read up to the 11th and have really loved what was done in the LN.
he didnt choose a female avatar
they used volumes 1-4 and 2/3rds of volume 8 to make the first season, so chances are they will use 5-8 this season and show us the Excalibur mission, with it possibly ending with the part where alicization beginning starts
Now Kirito is gonna be even cuter
9:30am pacific time... so... 11:30am... I'll be working. I hate to have to miss the first episode's live stream. Maybe I can get the day off....
Call in sick, Just don't say you have anime fever.
Gold, my friend, gold.
move west!
10:30 am for me, YAY CENTRAL. all shows come up at times that are neither exceptionally late nor exceptionally early. :-P
Think that's bad? Those of us who live in Europe have to wait for a whole month before we can watch it. Now that's some Grade-A bullshit right there.
So... I see COD got that anime adaption
OMG NOSCOPES PLZ... Oh goodness..
I could see kirito being pegged as the knife humiliation noob xD!
I feel I should mention that you should go search for "Miracle of Sound The Call of Duty Circus". It's a classic.
@Xaelon Having witnessed this masterpiece myself I can confirm that it is spectacular and worth your time.
@Pyro "started" to pop up? where have you been the past decade?
guys remember, kirito's avatar is still male, not female, the character with the blue hair is Sinon
You don't understand how much I need this, I will kill for this shit, not would, will. I need this
your profile pic fits your comment so well XD
somebody give this guy a pass before he blow some sh*t up
I've been tweaking out since the January movie!! .. .. . . I NEED MY FIX!! !
I think I dislocated my jaw from it dropping open and staying that way through all 3 of the PVs. I'm so happy right now...I've got a ginormous raging girl boner! I love SAO and I LOVE my Kirito wall scroll that I touch every day!!


i cant wait for it just 1 more week what a way to end the 4th of July with this new season of SAO.
man he just can't put the games down.
shouldnt it be GUN ART ONLINE NOW? either way this still looks really bad ass i cant wait!
Besides, if that was the case, then the (A) in (SAO) would have stood for "Sword ALfheim online".
For those who have read the Light Novels this is the Phantom Bullet arc for Sword Art Online the first series was the Aincrad arc, for those who haven't read the books stop wasting your time and read them
But but but but... If I read the books, then I'll spoiler an entire series and won't want to watch it any more because I'll know exactly how it ends! (Just like with Game of Thrones.)
But even if you read it, seeing it makes it so much better. My opinion
Trust me Off, I've read the books a hundred times, and I was still excited for the first season. And I'm just as excited to see how they pull off GGO in the anime. And there'll always be stuff changed or left out, so best to read the books!
ADD. TO. QUEUE.
Never left my queue.
Was kept quietly tucked away in the middle of my 173 show queue
This has been my second in queue for a long time, following Hunter x Hunter, and immediately after this is Log Horizon for the upcoming seconds season this fall (I hope, I pray!).
My body isn't ready.
Get ready mudafuka
Mine isn't either.
can i use one of your guest passes?
...i think its funny when Japanese try to speak English, but other times i think its pretty damn erotic...
This is my kind of style, I am definitely gonna enjoy this more than sword art online!
I'm kind of stuck on the 11th book right now, but that's well past GGO, which is what this is...and I have to say that GGO was a better arc to me than even SAO.
@ Bans: I'm loving the Alicizaiton arc.
BOOM!!!
So...SAO will become a FPS?
Yah probably, that's kinda a surprise huh.
