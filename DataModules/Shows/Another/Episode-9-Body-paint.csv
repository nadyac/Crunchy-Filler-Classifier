500, 400, 300, 200. you are on the ball. 100, 50, touchdown. landing complete.
Dude that ball was worth over 2 million. It also had sentimental value to it. Think about how much time it spent with them making memories. That ball was special.
You know the more this show goes on, the more I think that the people in this town are just stupid careless.
Yeah, stabbing yourself in the throat after murdering your mother. Totally careless.
They should just have fucking online classes for class 3 -_-''
...Or they should simply not have a class 3. Disaster averted.
They probably tried that, right after trying to rename the class, more than likely did not work.
Instead of worrying about naming it something it isn't, or dramatically changing the class system, just don't have a 9th grade. They even said there were other local schools, why don't they just drive 10mins more to a safe school?

Really?! Man, I can't seem to find the scene... just 17:58. Anyone else know where it is?
The author did a good job of scaring me mindless for a few minutes, In that respect.
ikr I had to turn around and look at the window behind me after that scene
I was thinking this exact same thing. Is it weird that that death is so far the only one that got to me?
LMAO, your comment made my day. But the scary thing is I live on a hill and there are actually giant ass diggers and trucks outside my house doing roadworks and shit.
I need to stop watching this when a) I'm about to go to sleep and b) I'm home alone...
No way! I watch one episode of this each night before bed. It's been great, but it's so hard not to cheat and watch more.
or c) During a thunderstorm at night
i just started this series, and immedietly after i started ep 1 it started raining and thundering.
I still watch it with my turtle beaches at midnight.....
Midnight lights out and wearing headphones
These young people just don't know how to properly treat cassette tapes.
i still have a cassete player and couple boxes of tapes...
lolz i got a cassete recorder of course it just uses some random mini version of cassetes and it only has one cassete but i get it. oh and i am in 9th grade which means im 14 or born in 99
there still being used today in japan and by hipssters
I'm born 95, but am familiar with casettes. We kept using them til 2003 or something. Even my car has a casette player. Do regular people use them anywhere anymore, though? Or is it a hipsters exclusive thing?
if you think about it though this show takes place in 1998. casettes were still popular even in america until the early 2000's
alright who else almost shit their pants when the rock hit the window?


I heard the sound key that say something like, ''Hey, there is a rock coming'', but I expected it to be on the road, not on bloody glass.
No, no. The glass became bloody later.
No, I saw it coming from the start of the episode. I knew that those girls were dead as hell.
Even though i knew that lightning strike was coming it still scared the shit outta me
It is worse when I'm are watching this in the middle of a thunderstorm at night, I do not suggest it.
i thoght for a moment to look out my window after i saw the mouse in his hand...
omg this anime is sooo creepy i wish there was more anime like this!!!

maybe it's because of all the comment just reading them scary me o-o
Watch Shiki. Much scarier, but just as awesome as this anime is.
Shiki is good, but I think this one beats it. It's the music, it's just to chilling. Probably the only thing that's close to this would be Higurashi, but that wasn't really scary, imo.
I don't want to imagine the Another/Shiki + Lavender Town theme combination xD
If you don't want spoilers, read the comments AFTER you watch the episode. That's what I do. Comments are here to comment on the episodes.
Man, WHY did dude have to break the tape!? I wanted to hear what he did to stop the curse!! And that has to be the most random way I've seen someone go yet! A backhoe thru the bedroom window!? Once again, my mouth's dropped open in shock!
does anybody care about their " friends "? nobody is really sad about anybody dying they are just like oh 2 bad and walks on with things like its nothing
There really isn't any time to mourn. It's like being in a war. When your friends die, hold out till the end, then you can cry.
Check out "When They Cry" that anime will mess with your head.
Hahaha yeah its true..
I think when people are worried about their own survival they don't think much about others >_>
This isn't the kind of anime where characters emote like you'd expect. Kouichi has all this buried dread and, on a good note, Misaki's character isn't as overplayed as you'd expect. Her showing up everywhere probably has other implications.
Doesn't Mei's voice sound a lot like Yuki Nagato's? (character from : The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya)
you just knew the type wouldn't have finished
I was kind of waiting for the tape to finish, and then it would burst into flames, and the whole room would catch on fire, and only the "nice boy who's gonna fix the tape" would die. XD
Nah, there's gotta be the helplessly dimwitted character who survives much longer than he should (only to cause trouble) and the useful character(s) who help move things along for the almost one-dimensional protagonist.
Okay, so why wouldn't the school just not HAVE a class 3? Curse solved.
Do you really think that will work, just like when they changed the class name. It would transfer somehow. It would be to convenient
Maybe if they tear down the school, i mean, they already changed the class name and it didn't work
but then there wouldn't be a story
lol nothing fits lol this is just some stupid trick thing like a murderer planning tricks and shit
the sound, music, and animation for this series is so A+ i can't even. some of the best i've ever heard tbh
when i saw the brothers hand on the mouse i laughed i was like thats how im gonna die
I'm not going to like this status.. nope, because that sir is a death flag + I'd like to think I don't spend that much time on the computer even though it's true
Kouichi's dreams are actually becoming a little scarier than the rest of the anime.....
Damn... This is the anime version of Final Destination .. Yep yep .
Only better. :3
