I got so surprised/scared when the music started getting loud all of a sudden! so gonna watch this!
thanks for the heads up
i was hoping for a surprise like that when i seen this, after the pv i thought it might have been a 3-4 min show like pupa. so glad its a full series, i love mysteries and horrors
that scared the hell out of me... had my headphones to loud.... But it looks good, so we'll see
The promo tells you nothing about the actual anime please watch the first episode to get a taste of Another its not just another anime its another among the few anime that I love. (see what I did there)
That's really bad when you have to point it out lol.
I'm glad you did point it out though. Made it work for me
i just hope it's not another School Days *shudders*
its not at all
Going back to re-wach this series, it was amazing
Ahh I Had My Volume On My Head Phones All Loud.. >.< It Seems Interesting Though O;
(What I got from the promo) In this anime sounds will get loud and make you wet your self. Ok promo you job well done i will watch the anime now.
I love this anime
This anime is really good!!! I recomend it A LOT. I am trying to keep myself from rewatching it right now, because I just watched it on Easter (yeah I watched all of it in one sitting it's that good!!!)
im not gonna lie when i first saw the eye it scared the shit out of me
I can tell this show is going to scare the shit out of me...


just what we need, Another anime series
I Want Blood and Gore....Hope i find it here I'm actually exited for this,i want to see if this anime blows me away,wich hasn't happened in a while...we are suffering from a lack of EPIC anime here...
lol i think you found what you were looking for XD
I'm fine with gore, but not the "BOO! A monster pops on your screen suddenly" kind of anime. I hope Another isn't like that; I heard it's scary...
Just ANOTHER anime.... hehe
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FREAKING ANIME HELL YEAH
I'm not sure whether I should be afraid of the show, the plot, or whether I should be attentive to look out for sudden sound changes when I'm watching this anime. I guess I'll find out when I start watching.
the music mean something good this going to be good !
