Hey guys there's a killer on the loose so lets split up.


Yeah Hanajima... the names are hard enough to remember as it is, but then they go and use formal/informal names interchangeably. Like head of countermeasures is always called "Akazawa" but Takako used her first name "Izumi" just then.
Considering their luck with stairs, slow and steady could save lives.
true that
This is what you get for taking a class trip to the Resident Evil mansion.

Hey, these trips don't come cheap lad, especially when you want that authentic feeling.
Comment was dead on. Resident evil 1's staircase, Wooden doors to the left and right. Was first thing i thought of.
Seriously, don't forget to mention the poor lighting. Lol
I'm so glad I wasn't the only one thinking this!

I look through the comments during ads though. They also have a spoiler button to help people like me :D.
idc about spoilers LoL :S
I can't buy anything these characters are doing in this episode. This is just stupid.
all i thought during this episode it that those idiots got what they deserved
Well... the phones have no service either way so there's that.

And that my friends is how you teach your charizard fire blast.......very effective.

It's called a backdraft, my brother is a firefighter he has seen it happen...the fire is so intense from the pressure it can simulate an explosion/ blow out windows.
I was thinking "Didn't they learn anything in elementary school?"
Don't feel the handle just put your hand on the door if there is a fire on the other side the handle will heat up and burn your hand
Bring in Detective Conan to solve this mystery
someone opened my door when i was watching this episode. i instantly jumped up and punched them.
i slapped my poor kitty when he jumped in my lap :l
I have headphones, didn't know my mom was downstairs, and when she popped up from the basement I nearly pissed myself and screamed at the top of my lungs. I think she was more scared than I was T.T
I had a spazz attack and tackled my brother to the floor when he walked out from behind a wall in our living room (watching this on my laptop on the couch) I didn't hear him coming because my headphones are noise canceling...
this series wasn't scary when I watched during day with family, but at night all alone this was pretty freaky
Honestly, this was the first straight-up horror episode. But amazing buildup!
WTFFF!!! O___O This shit is too real for me!!! *clicks on next episode* XD
That's what I've been doing nonstop! It ends, I freak out, I worry I'm never gonna sleep again, then next episode
Holy mother of god o-o , what the hell is happening xD
I think chucky possessed some of them or somthing ACK! no not me i am never staying in a hotel again screw hotels like these i'll stay in a animal shelter or the old pplhome on my vaca screw that i eaitin at a place with 1 star and below
This episode just went on overdrive! It was like the author was just waiting to start killing all of the students at once.
Considering this is horror you should expect stupid characters xP It comes with the genre.
Problem is, when characters start acting stupid I start rooting them to die next lol. I can't stand people who can't put their act together in a situation where someone could die.
I was happy when those girls died who were trying to kill misaki. So sad about the teacher tho. These kids... holy shit
I'd get Misaki to freakin' get her act together and tell everyone who the dead person is.
What if she is the one that's dead?
Unless Mei's dead, it makes no sense for her to keep quiet about who really is. If they can believe another student kills people in the same class every year, goddamnit, you can make them believe in a glass eye that can save their lives.
Well, she did say that she almost died during her surgery. I'd pretty pretty freaking surprised if she wasn't the dead student.
Seriously. How hard would it have been for him during those brief breaks they had to say "Hey, Mei, who is the dead person? Ok. Lets go."
Yeah, it'd be pretty convenient for Mei to be the dead person. Except she told the MC that she wasn't. If she was lying, maybe she's now running off to kill herself? Although she is probably just searching the real dead person.

yea, before the things became crazy i was like 'oh, impressive how a witch hunt hasn't started yet.' and then a witch hunt started.
That's true, most of the deaths were a result of people panicking, or just being stupid like that guy who decided to open the dinning hall doors.
Hah that's a good thought. I feel like half of it is just paranoia and coincidences.
OMFG just take off the damn eye patch and find who it is!!
Dude she already knows who it is... based on her reaction in the last episode it just needs to be reveiled.
HAHAHAH

Good point. We are dealing with 14-15 year olds. Not fully developed people. 9th grade is hard enough without a curse killing everyone slowly
why aren`t there more of this kind of anime i`m loving it (L)
cause most people are like "eww this stuff is grouse" or "thats inappropriate and should not be shown" but me, give me gore and blood, ill be happy ^_^
i think dongan ronpa is gonna be like this,....students killing each other and stuff
Ya but dongan ronpa is completely unserious with its pink blood
Watch Monster
"we're sav-" BOOM *scary ladys face* Me: *SCREAMS*
At 18:08 "FALCON KICK!" Most epic scene of the episode for me.
lmfao i wasnt the only one who thought this
20:34 is what did it for me i was like, processing processing , processing ...Oh Crap
THIS SHOW ... IS LIKE A CUP OF COFFEE FOR ME . Soo GOOD!!! THEY NEED 2 MAKE MORE OF THIS TYPE! <3
Higurashi no naku koro ni is almost EXACTY like Another, but with a very interesting ending
Too bad they don't have it on CR.
Wow Misaki is such a tease. She seriously can't be bothered to say who the dead person is? I choose to believe that the "extra" is making everyone insanely stupid. It helps to explain why they're all idiots.
Do you really think people would believe her. Almost everyone there is mentally unstable. I think Misaki knows this.
Misaki is probably the most sane person in this show.
What do you mean by "probably?"


Kouichi: "I think we're safe here." Calamity: WHO DA FUCK SAID THAT?! *explosions*
