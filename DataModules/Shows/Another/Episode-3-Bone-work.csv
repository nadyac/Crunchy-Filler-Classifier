Only run with scissors!
@stark700 I see your comments everywhere.

@rcruzval123 THOSE ARE THE TRUEST WORDS EVER SPOKEN! *dies of laughter*
22:50 I love the look of the teacher's face. "God damnit! Every. Fucking. Year."
I love your pic
umm just wat happened?? ... that umbrella was scary stuff man
but really, why the spearbrella? is she also Zhou yun from dynasty worriers? is she planning on going to fight a dragon?
@Alphapak: not anymore she isn't...
@UnComikal Too soon?
My reaction: "Psh... mature content my-" *THAT scene* "HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF PEARL!"
...trying to kill you just doesn't appeal to me. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh my keister off when I see the scenes, but still.

WHY DID I DECIDE TO EAT WHILE WATCHING THIS. NOW I'M HUNGRY BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE EATING.
It was more lamer than I thought. The disclaimer had my hopes of the umbrella going to the eye and splattering the brains. Meh. The dramaturgy was excellent, but in means of disgust this didn't compare to the most brutal animes at all.
Brains wouldn't splatter because of an umbrella going through your head or eyeball. The most you'll get is losing the eyeball and the umbrella coming out the back of the head.
I will never see umbrella's the same way
What if...you...are the only one who can see the umbrella?
who even makes umbrellas like that??
note to self: never get a pointy-tipped umbrella
Well, I didn't plan on pulling an all-nighter, but it looks like I don't have a choice 'cause I'm not sleeping now.
lol its 2 am and my eyes are wider than the character's in SPC Containment Breach lol
It's 9:47 am....i've been up since 10am...yesterday ._. Was gonna take an afternoon nap....stumbled upon this...NEVERMIND!
I know right, I can hardly stand it, I have to see what's next
Me too, me too...
I was thinking I'd go to bed at the end of this episode... NOT ANYMORE!
before video: This video may be inappropriate for some people. Are you sure you want to continue? Me: O_____O umm yes? after video: OoO OOOHHHH!!!! IS THAT WHY?!?!?
I didn't see that message

its not just premium members. you can shut the warning off in your profile settings
First few minutes: Umm... I guess this counts as mature content... Last few minutes: Yeah... this show definitely isn't kid-friendly.


spoiler
Some one should have warned her about the stairs.
So. We meet again, Hella Jeff.
@Sarlouse spoiler
god damn 90's cell phones, always dropping calls
First 20 minutes - Huh, I don't see how some people would find this disturbing. Last remainder of minutes - Oh...I see why.

well, I don't want to test that theory, but am going to be shopping for new household items just to be sure.
