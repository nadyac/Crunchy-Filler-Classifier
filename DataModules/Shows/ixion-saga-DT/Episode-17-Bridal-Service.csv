You gotta wonder if the princess is really the only normal acting person in the show, or is she really the most twisted.
I think Both. She 'acts' the most normal, but on the inside she is by-far the deepest and most twisted of them all. The other 3 I think are the other way around.
actually shes normal untill the hyperactivity state with the 3 standing hair plucks XD
Is he actually making progress towards getting home?
i dont know
i find it getting better
the real question is. is he ever going to go home
nnnnope XD looks like one of those epic ending anime's where he never goes home XD
cant believe I am singing along with the intro song..I just love it lol
I've been singing along since the beginning "CHOO!"
Fist pump!
i used To sing along wiTh The ed also . They had To Take iT From me
Let's all sing together!
i still like the singing form the first 12 then this set
ONIIII-CHAAAAAAN!!!!!!
If I were to say I might be a Hyperion, can I also participate in Experiment A-1 only? :3 hehehe hello nurses
Hello Nurses who still didn't dress in white! They also won't think twice before jabbing a giant syringe in you lol

Detective Conan??!!!!!
I find Sainglain's formal attire visually impressive. Just saying.
This turned super awkward super quick from intelligent scientist to desperate younger brother. TF?
Damn, I wanted to hear a mad scientist laugh like the one from Steins;Gate. Anyways, funny episode
Love Kyoma's laugh. seriously, the first time i heard him do that, i doubled over laughing!
KUDOU SHINCHI!? IS THAT YOU!? 7:02
Ixion? Ixion.
I hear a lot of complaints about the english dubs not pronouncing words correctly, but my god the japanese pronunciation of Ixion was painful. fyi it's [ik-sahy-uhn _or_ ik-see-on], they did something like [ik-a-she-hoon] *flame shield up*

is the blonde from Incognito a male or a female??? i still dont know XD
Better question, is that scientist a girl or boy?
I'm pretty sure the officer is (biologically) a girl. For the first ED, it only shows her from the back, and she's got skinny girl arms.
It's definitely giving me flashbacks to first season Sailor moon villains, with the uniforms, hair, and sexual ambiguity. With all the stereotypes being made fun of, I still can't tell if this is actually meant as some sort of funny homage.
Why are all the hero's in the animes i've been watching acting gay? Jeez MAN UP!
Spare guest pass anyone?
