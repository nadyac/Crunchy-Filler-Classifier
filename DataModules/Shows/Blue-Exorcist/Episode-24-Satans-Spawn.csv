I'm curious about Mephisto..what is it that he wants exactly????
An Oni (Demon)
the god damm feels tho
That's whaat I'VE been wondering this ENTIRE time!!!!
He's Hisoka!

he wears glasses on the inside too !!??
Of course, He's Yukio. :3
Bahahaha... XD
Apparently people are forgetting "Self Image".
yukio looks like a butterfly
bleach
i like potatos
Feia20032- but they are sometimes referred to as a symbol of change as well
He's a pretty pretty butterflyyy~
@noobie13 So, Death = Change?
It's understandable, him being the king of Hell, but Satan really misunderstood Yuri when she talked about a world shared by deamons and humans.
Satan being Satan he was bound to misunderstand
Absolutely. Well said, Hasan.
demons* yw

What the!!! Satan has a lovelife?
ExFahim, that's not--well, only kinda--alright, it's true.
Better love story than Twilight.
Of course bro.
In Anime...ANYTHING is possible.
tbh this is so last episode

I don't understand... If the gate is open... Why doesn't Satan just walk through in his own damn body?
not so. he said himself that yukio was the one that matured first. It could have been Rin.
Why is it -18 dislikes on Deadly? Technically Rin is a demon and Yukio is a normal person right? :l? So he can't take Rin's body, right?
what have you been watching, Satan explained it himself in this episode. Yukio was simply ready before Rin.
Well uh Last i checked Satan doest have a body because he's a (SPIRIT)UAL demon...

am i the only one who thinks Satan isn't that bad of a guy just seriously misguided

Tater, there is more to science than the theory of evolution. Even if you don't believe in evolution, it's stupid to think science hasn't proven anything at all.
Humans evolved from a common ancestor to modern monkeys, not monkeys themselves. Science is merely the search for information, and all scientific theories must be back up by data. For those who don't "trust science," you're not (cont.)
(cont.) supposed to trust it. If you disagree with a theory, search for evidence to prove it wrong. However, your evidence will also be subject to scrutinization, so make sure you have the right kind of evidence.
It's really stupid that they make freaking Satan a character that you feel for. I think he is lying, because he is good at that.
Aww, so Satan was actually sweet in a way~. You know, trying to achieve the dream Yuri wanted... ;D He's just insane! ^^ (Aw, Rin and Yukio...What a brother moment. Lol)

You know what a big tail means
Mephisto is just so shady.
But I LOVE Him! He was One of the best parts of this Anime, for Me at least!
Me want more episode!!!! (/>.<)/
I want Season 2! </3
god needs to come down and bitch slap satan

plz don't down on religion like that...it's very rude and disrespectful. at least maxine wasn't shoving religion down ur throat...I no it's an opinion, but saying that there "is no god" to someone that believes in God is....annoying.
@Kat And pushing that there is is annoying to those to who do not believe. @Black Your comment was unneeded and added no value to the conversations. I award you no points, and may a higher being have mercy on your soul.
lmfao this is so pointless. maybe he was saying there's no god in this series? or even if he meant in real life dnt b such pussy's about it
So.. Maxine posted that 3 years ago.. I'm pretty sure he does not give a damn about what Black said. (Probably same goes for Black as well since it was a year ago. )
Noooo! Only one more episode!? :/
final episode is coming, but damn that mephisto hanging out and watching all this shiz go down, such a lazy ass demon
this comment was made in 2011 woah
Yukio looks better with pointy ears
why hasnt there been god an angel of something angelic in this entire series..... that might make a good second season, throw in some angels or something......

Well everyone's like "why doesn't God do anything?" well, God is... he doesn't even need to lift a finger to see humanity, his own creation, defeating the evil...
DSK, Seeing as Satan is the antagonist, in what way is this a "satanist" anime? Sure they made him somewhat sympathetic, but not by much. I think you're a little confused about what "satanist" is.
@XxDeadlySoulKillerxX *Year later* (Everyone still thinks his opinion is the same since a year ago where he was clearly ignorant of another country's belief system)
Standing 2 feet away from Yukio, it takes 50 seconds to run to where he is. Sounds legit.
I like how I'm getting nickolodeon commercials for this anime.
