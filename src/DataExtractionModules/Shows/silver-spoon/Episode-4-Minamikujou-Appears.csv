Remember: The fact that Ayame couldn't get into Ezonoo even though her family's in agriculture means that she's even dumber than Tokiwa. xD
That laugh and being that dumb she is going to have it rough when she doesn't have money.
Tokiwa is dumb even when he tries. Ayame is too dumb to try.
You made me feel better about her character as whole, thank you for that! XD
If only Ayame was a cow. She wouldn't have lasted long.
@Darkmagick8 Just the thought of that makes me feel sorry for her...How can you stoop lower than Tokiwa? What one plus one? Tokiwa: THREE!!!!
It's official. Maron is the most badass horse on the freaking planet.
You really shouldn't ride horses on pavements or sidewalks though they can slip and fall and end up injured. The grass is better.
maron is definitely a close decendent to kokuoh
I bet Maron would speak with a thick Yakuza style accent.
Bet he's a descendant of Epona
Maron is the most tsundere horse, and it's why he love him so much.
Really nice feel-good ending there, always a fan when the ED song starts early, and I liked how Mikage just accepted and ignored most of Ayame's bluster during the episode, also here's to Maron. A truly awesome tsundere horse.

"Lend me your strength" -derp faces- LOL almost died
Had to pause for a long while to let out all the laughter on that one.
I love this show! It just shows how great a mangaka Hiromu Arakawa is to develop fullmetal alchemist, then create this series which is the exact opposite! I also read she grew up on a dairy farm, you can feel her experience in this series!
I didn't know that much about her, but it kind of sounds like she is Mikage

Now now, not nice to hit girls. Maybe a water spray like you would use for training puppies?
her laugh is like a yippy puppy
A wild ojou-sama appears. Ojou-sama uses 'hohohoho'. Its super-effective.
best friggin laugh ever!!!!!
[This comment has been removed]
There's always that blonde anime character with the "OHH HO HO HO" laugh. And most of the time they're annoying and rich.
Its a real Ojou-sama when they have the laugh, curls, and overly-competitive attitude down.
I always hate these characters.
Not to mention the laughs characters have on One Piece,
From Slayers, we have Naga, complete with rivalry and that OHH HO HO HO laugh, and that hand pose thing they do when they laugh, no stand-out princess curls though...
I really like the show, but that new character is a bit annoying. Hopefully the laugh is less grating as the series progresses.
At least we now who she is. I guess they decided it was timefor a comedic heel to appear. Though I was happy with Tokiwa taken the bunt of the comdey relief.
As always, you crack me up Silver Spoon!!!
I can understand why people would think the ohohohoh is annoying, but personally every time I hear a character with it, I can't help but laugh, something about it is just so funny to me.
It's funny the first 5 or 6 times, then after that....
It was a lil bit funny in the first anime i heard it in for about 5 or 6 times as TheCoolAlchemist said. After those few times it only makes me want to punch a hole trough my screen every damn time....With a Sledgehammer!!!
That went by way faster than I thought. Also we got to see more of Hachiken without his glasses! Keep it coming!!!!! >XD
Mikage sees Hachiken w/o glasses....nosebleed.
Ayame is the Jar Jar Binks of this series so far... completely forgettable and brings nothing to the story, just an annoying character.
even jar jar was a comic relief
She brings drill hair.
Difference is Jar Jar Binks is actually funny...
LOL, Hachiken's got some unlikely competition in the form of a horse.

Lol... She's like someone you love to hate, though. But, don't worry, she's not in the series much, so it's okay if you really dislike her.
Maron is such a great character.
that ending was so funny.
Oh man. They cut out the best part. I was looking forward to seeing Ayame's horse completely decimate what was left of the phone.
Plus seeing Shigo act smug for pointing out that the data on the chip could still be saved, then SMASH. They also cut out the joke about Tokiwa & co. skipping festival duties to be there.
Minamikujou's voice is exactly as I pictured it and I love it XD
No surprise there.
Hachiken - Dumped by his horse, Forever alone XD
Never alone with Mikage!
Seeing Hachiken clinging to Maron was pretty nostalgic, same thing happen to me as a kid, luckily I didn't fall down as hard as Hachiken did, that looked painful =_= Great episode, Maron is now officially my favorite character in this Anime
