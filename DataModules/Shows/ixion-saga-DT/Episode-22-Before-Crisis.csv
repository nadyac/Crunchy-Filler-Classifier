its like we got trolled with that whole police movie flashback lol
valid, but i definitely dig the slight gintama vibe XD
Yea that episode seemed pretty hard boiled
Completly trolled. How can Leon be so calm? and the blonde dude is not girly.

Ya not girly but really gay, lol.
Love the guy in the boat, nails it on the head for you at the end.

I agree with the boat driver: what the hell!?! What is this crap?
...Legend of the Blue Wolves...oh god...*dies laughing*
Glad I'm not the only one who recognized it.. XD
Oi Leon, you must be a really bad M...
we got punked just watching that...
Oh! I get it. This is the "baseball episode." That episode that has absolutely nothing to do with the actual show.

Lol funny how they admit the show was stupid xD
Ixion saga's troll episode
And the 4th wall comes tumbling down again lol
Hey this is better than some of the Naruto fillers that went on and on for a a season or two.
This show just keeps getting better. LEGEND OF THE BLUE WOLVES!!!!!! lol

i hate to say it but feels like a totally wasted episode of a show i like
why?...WhY?....WHY?!?!?! THAT WAS FKING HILARIOUS!!! \o/
Hahaha, I about died laughing with the end of this episode. The humor behind this whole series, don't take anything about this anime seriously! LOL
I maybe in the minority with this statement but I liked that episode. Not sure what kind of episode it was but I liked it nonetheless.

Thats what I thoughts so too. I was cracking up watching this one just because of what it is
haha, I agree with you Vinny, idk why ppl say it's a wasted episode?... Love near the end when "Erec-sama" was like "You get...Punked!" was laughing so hard I think I chocked on my spit :S
poor boat driver..
TROLL TROLL TROLL TROLOLOLOLOLLLL
They see Ixion trollin...
Filler episode. But at least it wasn't a recap episode.
I don't think that qualifies as a filler episode. Those usually make an honest attempt to add to the fiction. This one was just dumb. In a good way
