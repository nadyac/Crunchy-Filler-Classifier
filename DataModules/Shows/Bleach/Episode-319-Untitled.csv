Wow...what, only a month and some other crazy super powerful dude shows up to take over the world? I think soul society needs to improve their background checks during recruitment or something, cause they've got some questionable people.
And if there is no bleach there is no villains.
If there's neither, then life would have no meaning
If there is no Bleach, then your white laundry won't be as clean.
Yh! and if there are no soul reapers, then there isn't anyone to shout Bankai
we cant have that
Looks like the new villain went clothes shopping with dondochakka
What in the heck is the Head Captain doing through all of this?
i 'am chilling they should never call on me to fight it just shows how weak they are.
are ichigo's friends allowed to beat ANY BAD GUY?!?! just once i want ichigo to get there last and be like "you guys won? good job!!"
I really wish that this filler villain didn't dress like...well a filler villain
So I am watching this just thinking to myself that at any moment one of the Captains will say "Umm like a month ago I was on the team that took on Aizen and his hell thugs with bonefacepowers and your a lame ass dude with two tone-hair."
I watch bleach and naruto, and the 2 things that both shows need to do is have the girls say something besides the main characters name 5gazillion times, and have the main character learn something new more often....
i don't think i can hate this villain more than i hated aizen
i hate how they make ichigo a total bad ass then he becomes really perthitic its just sad/ annoying
Those facial reaction shots would be sooooo much more affective if they didn't need to cycle through 15 different people one at a time. By the 4th person I go cross-eyed.
nozomi looks pretty sexy
I like how Kurotsuchi's sword sticks right out of his crotch.
the commercials on this website are done in such an extremely annoying way that i pledge to NEVER use any product that they show. Seriously, crunchyroll made me hate skittles
Why does Inoue have to sound like shes taking it up the ass after every damn phrase she says?
wow im amazed they can still make such an interesting plot without aizen
I know people will probably disagree with me on this, but I think this is a decent filler that takes into account Ichigo slowly losing his Shinigami powers very well. I foresee this arc being pretty long because of the manga.
This is a filler? Its good to me like the main story
if you got a membership and helped support the site you wouldn't have to deal with the ads....
Inue must be a fake...she was actually worried about someone besides Ichigo
good arc seems good.... for now, lets hope it doesnt go south later in O_O
yep agreed
Well I guess there needed to be some explanation as to why ichigo would lose to such a lame douche
