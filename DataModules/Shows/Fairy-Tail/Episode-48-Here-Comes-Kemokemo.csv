I don't think anyone is going to ask Fairy Tail to participate in the next guild exchange.
they well be ask but thos 5 cant be a part in it
The whole time i was looking forward to them moving on to Sabertooth but when Erza made Kagura call her "Nee-san!" (^ o ^)
@_Black_Saber_ That was the best part
Lyon: "So When are you and Juvia gonna tie the knot?" So even secondary characters support Gruvia! LOL XD

At least someone is trying to put them together here.........
I guess because he realized hat he can't have her, he want's to make sure she end up happy. Lyon is a good guy.
its jiva Bamiels
Lyon best man.
To everyone: This isn't filler persay. It's based off the light novel that came out recently.

Perfect, this was what I was looking for. Thanks so much.
It doesnt feel like filler, I'm actually suprised I'm enjoying these episodes as much as I do. Thanks for the update.
I still cant get the ending picture from last week outa my head, damnit Mira why you so fine
Kagura is just as good looking as Mira, but I like Mira's personality better.
so who do you think the next ending credit cover girl is gonna be?
might be milliana
might be evergreen
Yukino since they are teaming up with sabertooth
So this is what we've been seeing in the OP?
The way that Lucy was looking at Natsu though..... Anyway I hope they start the Tatarus arc after this short one.

I bet Juvia would of jumped at Gray if she saw him in that suit.
How can I get me one of those Kemokemo?!
Plot twist: Thats a terraformer you still think its cute?
LOL^^
@vocharlie nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! curse your spoiling comment
And I was worried there wasn't gonna be any fan service.
21,26 natsu your face broke
That was weird, I hate to be "that guy" but this episodes animation looks really really sloppy and not in the way were everyone hates the new animation but I don't know this episodes animation just didn't look great.
this episode has been hilarious xD i haven't laughed this hard watching fairy tail in a while!
Lyon Ships Gruvia hard!
First, Gray said it's not even on his mind and he's not thinking about getting married. Then, he says he want's a private reception? Lyon's response was epic: "How would Juvia's family feel?"
Capicorn just went full Jojo on that monster

gomu gomu no Gatling GUN !!!!!
@DarkWinter24 I think you misspelled it. Its ORA ORA ORA ORA!!!!
The recent ED's need to stay even after the story arc resumes.

Why didn't Natsu just suck in those flames Kemokemo blasted him with?
Natsu too shocked to inhale?
Kemokemo is definitely cute.

it's fun to watch it without subtitles sometimes.
