okay, did anyone else notice Ao was eating a fish..?
start with eating the medicinal herb. then the fish. then her hair. And later, he had his head trapped in the honey pot like pooh

ooh thanks for the knowledge! ^
Deer will actually eat birds, if given the chance. Seriously. Also, pikas will eat dead birds' braaains in the winter.
I noticed that as well! XD
Ao is the star of this show, clearly
I've never seen a squirrel eat a fish before.

He ate the fish raw... It was still squirming, begging for life. He ate it brains and all. The thing is still squirming in his stomach. Brutal.
'Swaggercandy: Ao of the dawn ' ...... I can't even!!!! XD
@Bythesword86 that is normal for carnivorous animals. Only humans make a habit of killing prior to eating.

ran from the D
Poor Haku... yes, it was coming on strong, but at least this time she noticed. And she did admit to him that he was special last ep. We keep seeing these dragons liking her as a woman... if she takes one of them, I'll take Haku hehe ^^
0 to a 100 real quick lol
no it's 0 to 69
Put all that aside for a minute.....so if you put honey on the part of your hand that has a needle or splinter in it, it'll come out on its own? Seriously? Sounds too unreal.

Ao in the honey pot reminds me of pooh bear xD
Then Yoon sees Ao with honey on his face, decides Ao's the culprit for the disappearance of his honey, and suddenly starts thinking that maybe squirrel steak would be good for dinner that night...
Poor Hak... Tempted into his desires because of the Green Dragon and now he thinks he's an idiot D=
o.o something totally sexy about Hak licking honey of her hands.....
^agreed. Poor Hak though... he just cant keep suppressing himself or he'll just explode!... which could be really entertaining either way BUT!
Why must these episodes seem so short T-T I need an hour special!
I was happy they squeezed juuust a bit more story into the ending-song time Every little bit helps!
I want a four hour Ghandi-length movie. Every week.
I know, this show seem to go so fast every week! I'm going to have to marathon this a week after the final show. Not that won't keep up with t until then, but it'll be gratifying to watch it all again one after the other.
thats one of the biggest problems i have with good shows that im following and is up to date with, it seems as if they end just as the opening is over, and then you have to wait a whole week for the next episode. 7 freakin days!
Is it bad that I'm thinking Yona is gathering people for her RPG party?
She isn't?
Except she put all her points into charisma, so she could have super powerful companions from the start.

The facial expressions+jokes in this show are too much for me, i lose my shit every time.
So, Jae-ha, how long do you think repeating "It's only the dragon blood" is going to work?
Until it's his turn with the honey...
The honey porn uh I mean "pot" of confessions
Yona's harem is increasing every episode.
You mean Ao's harem
lol interesting to see it the other way around this show, usually theres sevearl heroines
^That's because this is a shojo anime.
I knew that honey scene was coming, but god, it's a lot more 'yummy' animated. <3
How many bowls of rice can you eat on it?
Yesss, way better than in the manga... So sexyyyy... Ughhh... ///O.O/// (*^0^*)
Hak getting a little excited over there with the honey
"You look 10 years older." You're the man, Hak!
Those two are going to be trolling the hell out of each other once Jeaha joins the group. It's going to be a joy ride lmao.
I think I've run out of ways to say how great this anime is.
Did Captain Sakakibara Yoshiko just raise the once-this-battle-is-over flag? <shiver>
Hey, she said alone Ao! No helping
Capt. Gigan saw the squirrel and was like, "meh. I'll allow it."
It would be a crime NOT to allow Ao's presence.
Aww Hak that's so sweet-- Hey! That's lewd!
It's all very sweet for Hak.
I would let Hak lick my hands any day!!
Yona,Haku & honey? ohh my...<3
