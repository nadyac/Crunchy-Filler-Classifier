More like DD missions!
lol she dragged ichigo by the face like how ichigo did to aizen lmfao
I think this ramen guy ended up in the wrong anime and thought it was naruto he was trying to befriend
i mean, they both have orange hair...
I don't watch Naruto and I know Naruto have blonde hair....
its orange, his dad had yellow and his mom had red, they make a big deal about it
its been more than a year and orihime still hasnt made a move, ichigo your to oblivious
you're* too*
Yeah, and to think they could have had a moment in his room.

jinta looks like he should be on jershey shore
ok duh hes not human. what kind of comment was that? "no human can be this fast" HE is in the DAMN SKY >.> its not like every human can flash step and jump on house to house >.>
Bleach is still awesome as ever.
wow... her boobs got bigger.... over doing it a little mr.tite? still love rukia more
at least its not as bad as one piece
Yeah... I <3 Rukia
It's either they gave her a better personality where she actually fights, or make her visually appealing. I hated her SO much the past few season -___-"
Yeah, they got bigger :/ And personally i find her really annoying ''Kurosaki-kun'' all day avery day makes me want to punch her in the face
lol she is a 17 and a girl, there is a thing called puberty that young people go through at that age

Hey Ichigo has a laptop now
Recap ends at 2:25
@DKsaNn nevermind Kon, what ever happended to Nel....
She's still in wacomundo.
That's what Captain Kurotsuchi is going to Hueco Mundo for... To do experiments with her...
ichigo got pulled away against his will into a white mini-van...makes you wonder what her intentions were lol
idk... but with boobs like that who would put up a fight???
Ichigo would.
Dude I wish random people would walk up to me and offer me ramen.
Ramen? Wtf. Ginjo reminds me of Naruto.
I'm absolutely loving this. Bleach had started out so good, then just kinda devolved into a typical fighting anime, with very little story or character. This is so nice that the series is going back to the feel from the beginning.
Seriously? Shes in ur room being all fidgety and ur like yo take ur bread home... -______- Just get them together already!!!!!
One meaning of Unagiya is Unagi and ya, meaning eel store. Usually restaurants specialized in fish and eel.
