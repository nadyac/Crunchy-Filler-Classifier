partly fusing cells hokage wife just gained birth other stuf this comment removed thanks spoiler pretty obvious first glance actually oo lol all im saying action too drawn out flashbacks great give some backround make so can keep up but action fucking annoying way drawn out note selfnever eat sweets whilst trying use fireball jutsu might kicked face lmao your picture matches perfect your comment im sry obito lost guy final matches but no one can beat guy just well guy back topic hand which will probably answer itself madara keeping up times like kakashi beat guy never thought kicking some one face stop choking gotta try next time lol one voicing obito one who voiced sillygoofy tobi personally liked much more serious tone compared previous role played this comment removed well being untouchable mask hiding your facewow could do anything world didnt need silly tobi persona anymore put aside like any tool no longer needed naruto should done rasen shuriken naruto aware your weakness stealth rock throws master ball ball wiggles twice ball breaks open run toobi not toobi questions leiser genius think deserve some applause pachipachipachipachi hhahahahahahaaha so funny obitos faceee omfg then madara just getting good dammit know right do expect us stay sane now wait so long next episode baaaah too long but better good drawing good dialogs fact 90% episode flashback didnt matter im still speechless everything just happened these flashbacks were already part series arent being added would literally use filler change story entirely order not these flashbacks obito an awesome hero before brought him back dead made him fake madara now hes biggest disgrace waste good character ive ever seen all because his schoolboy crush died not even his gf would speechless some stupid person hadnt spoiled comments all way back beginning series flashback manga chapter revealing obitos identity guys just because flashbacks were cannon doesnt mean were not allowed annoyed by what probably thingking guys think meteorites falling big troubleno wait sec its just madara coming down sky momentary pause oh shit thats worse then million meteorites falling know ant49 dont use fireball jutsu while eating candy might choke kick probably saved his ass old gon not new old gon takeuchi junko voice actor did younger obito new gon who heck let madara get any cheat code your profile reads madara any all cheats should set hecknaw madaras presence bad news took good long look obito before says yourehoggingallthefuntoyourselfarentyou so just like naruto but went dark side yep kakashi sasuke holy crap obitos voice actor same gons too am having capsgasm this comment removed && knuckles this comment removed millzf combo breaker this comment removed well something like shown before remember yamato disguised sasori way back naruto co were still looking sasuke able perfectly mimic sasoris voice time were stupid get joke time worst kept secret history anime officially unveiled what do not understand rin died clearly saw her war memorial chunin exam arc bro obito mentioned part during chapter where ceremony sandaime yugao talks kakashi by memorial stone also kakashi gaiden released before part even started all know obito beginning hadnt noticed missing eye his left also exact same hair couldnt notice these things xitogun well anime obito trying get eyes nagato used forbidden justu izanagi not die konans trap lost his left eye maybe stole eye another uchiha major thing eye deal his technique obviously kamui some form factwhen encountered each other sasuke attacked while blind straight up told kakashi kamui wasnt gonna work why uchia clan so deadly lol will never let leaf live down why did change kakkashis obitos voice flashback know right young kakashis voice used roughly same but little higher pitched wanted show young were got criticized kakashi gaiden old kakashi obito sounded so now made sure illistrate young were kakashi 13 time an adult voice before thats actually good idea never cant get into sasukes flashbacks because his voice old man like years its totally ridiculous also should given older naruto grownup voice dont think really holds up all much though mean look characters voices part were like only prominent male character whose voice high naruto time moment truth by timeyou must mean next time hope will outstanding because wait trash wont make impersonating madara so its only natural would want use madaras voice ran into some his fellow classmates many times throughout anime mightve recognized his voice didnt cover up im wondering impersonated madara so well know real life same guy voicing madara obito up until episode but why didnt make obitos madara voice sound little different than real madara megasean 3000 voice change because claiming madara so used madaras voice search same voice actor madaras obitos voice before episode his name naoya uchida did same thing yamato posing sasori way back during search sasuke arc yamato sounded exactly like sasori probably comes down chakra allowing do even naruto did turned sasuke like first couple episodes man ending gave goosebumps second crazy perhaps kisame met real madara time maybe real madara intruduce him obito told by kabuto before plan madaras not obitos told madara wasnt sure obito still following plan not something effect yeah just thought welltobiandobitohavethesameletterstobisonlyeyeisasharinganinhisrighteyehemightcoverhisfacebecauseitsdisfigured just made sense soon watched kakashi gaiden ah yes forgotten that; so answered before actual reveal his identity spoiled before any real reason guess point were enough doubts not quite make sense did correctly guess who kabutos trump card but thought might some other sort funny business going which mightve caused madara not his body most anticipated episode year axerith while some flashbacks indeed meant prolong anticipation most however pure manga material fights between iwa boys were prolonged else all new straight manga sylvertearbout 1y 3m didnt really care who behind mask after seeing still dont get what big deal why were guys so anticipatory anyway personally anticipating narutokurama friendship waaay more know right ive wanted happen so long hmm anyone else feel like all episode did confirm last weeks episode lol
