Erza covered nearly head to toe in bandages, still a boss.
Wouldn't you have oven mitts too if you were about to battle 10,000 fire breathing dragons?? If anything the soldiers know what's up!
not all fire breathing some breath shadows and light shreds of metal and wind with the force of a house sized cannon ball.
k
If only guildarts was here. Oh no the dragons are.. nvm guildarts uppercutted them



Lucy, you got some 'splainin' to do.
Once they said Future Rogue was evil it kinda clicked. After that it was just a waiting game.

Yeah, I could even hear the same rasp in his voice that the pumpkin dude had. I'm betting that if you look it up, you can even find out from the voice actor for those two characters...
kabo .....
KABO!!!
Who else is that short?


Is shiny, rogue brainwashed their pitiful minds and next episode a cute little dragon appears and eats them for their stupidity

Hello? spoiler alerts?
I will neve..ALL HAIL HYPNOTOAD.
Don't you think Future Lucy should've lead with "Hey, Dragons come through the portal, don't open it" but nooo everyone is beating around the bush

lol this thread is so fu-ALL HAIL HYPNOTAOD!
If you can use it to go back in time, doesn't it make sense the people (or monsters) back then can use it to come forwa- ALL HAIL HYPNOTOAD.
It's lunatic, get it lunar because of the eclipse! And it goes bo- ALL HAIL HYPNOTOAD.
The animation seemed different and weird this episode.. maybe I'm just imagining it. Anyways why do these episodes have to end so quickly lol. Waiting till next Friday is going to kill me D: Oh well, All is good because Fairy Tail is love
Well you gotta remember that this new season is using a completely different art/animation team. Supposedly everything is supposed to be more like the manga.

Dude, drop a spoiler tag on that. It's not hard to do.

I know right canna dosn't look like cana
I don't know why, but this episode was not what I was hoping for. I wanted the actual dragons to show up and the war to begin. And I don't mean the ones after the credits.

this episode was written by George R.R. Martin
Cliffhangers are fine, but this studio (which has pretty awful animation) doesn't know how to do them right. Should have ended with the dragons starting to show up from the portal. Instead it gets spoiled by the preview.

once again anime proves hair equals power.
That's why lumberjacks have beards.
Flare is the most powerful character!


I've always wanted Natsu's sandals. They are the most sturdy things other than his scarf that I've seen. He can run, jump and slide against a stone floor while he's bracing himself from a magic blast without them breaking or coming loose.
Now available at PacSun.
made by the same people who make skirts that are engineered to always almost show whats inside
@Fried_Twinky no please not the people who made the skirts that almost show whats inside
That would be Shiroyasha, from Problem Children Coming From Another World. Literally, she made a skirt that's enchanted to ALMOST show what's under the skirt, but never reveal it.

may I take this moment to say that mirajane is easily one of the best characters in any anime I have ever seen
Big sisters definitely rock!
Elfman's face at 10:10 hahaha o.O
The background music during the fight scenes get me SO FRICKIN' PUMPED.
Was it just me, or did anyone else get goosebumps from Natsu in the beginning of the episode? o.o
Don't worry you are not the only one lol.
Yay, I wasn't the only one! XD
The animation wasn't strong, but the voice actor killed it.
....well....that ending is ominous....
ahhhh stuffs about to get REAL! can't wait for next week.
No wonder those soldiers suck at fighting; they're all wearing oven mitts.
Only took an episode to not fully open 1 door. NPNP
