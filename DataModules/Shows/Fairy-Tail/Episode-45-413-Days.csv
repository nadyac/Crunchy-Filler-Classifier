Yes i think so LOL
In 13:12 Juvia looked like a man....
50 shades of gray
Fro thinks so too!
Is Laki's room a sex dungeon?
^^^^ Awesome Comment, will be thinking of that pun whenever I see Gray from now on lol.
I see what you did there haha well done sir
Well for Juvia, it's be more like 50 Days of Gray-sama!
someone post a link here once that fic is up!
Found one! XD https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078071/1/50-Shades-
This episode is just telling you which ships are coming true!
More like it's teasing us.
But they were always obvious...
It's official, they are cannon now. Because reasons.
i am faithful to my hopes! even if they arent canon possibilities anymore!

It is not hard, Gray is not interested on anyone and Juvia is persistant. She is not hard to look at, so it is kind of weird gray is not hitting that.
Isn't it mentioned earlier that he might have a thing for Lucy?
In the real world they would've hooked up already
Evergreen X Elfman CONFIRMED
This story shows up in Fairy Tail Matsuri... are those considered canon? I mean I want Evergreen/Elfman confirmed. Is it called Everman or Elfgreen?
Ya they're canon. These chapters were the 2 chapters per week specials .
This episode was adapted from a manga chapter, yeah, but the anime staff did add some scenes in order to make it last a full episode. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't remember the Elfgreen stuff from when I read the chapter.

i want to die just because of your comment -_-
Of course you want to.
"Ah, it's really warm." Heart sewn back together a bit.
All i got to say is that I want that Juvia pillow ;p Grey doesn't want it anyway
I guess Gray had to.... LET IT GO
We can learn a lot from Juvia that's how you treat your love one on valentine's day...you stalk them with gifts..LOL
I wouldnt mind getting Juvia body pillow though...... Just saying. If a girl gave me that as a gift..... that would be pretty awesome.
"I 'm an Ice Wizard. The cold never bothers me anyway." Gray, did you just reference Frozen?
LOL This episode literally confirmed all the shippings
I think Juvia's counting is 7 years off
Time didn't pass for them in that 7 Year time skip so her counting is accurate.
Gray is such a tsundere
THE GRUVIA/NALU/GAJEVY!!!

Why does it feel like no one cares about Evergreen/elfman? What would that even be called? Everelf? Elfgreen? Whatever I ship it.

Here, here sweet Pirunner. I was wondering when this would get a shipment. I vote for EverElf for a name.
Not Everman or Elfgreen?.. Ever man sounds about right.
does anybody else besides me wants to see juvia and gray together??, they make a good couple and i feel that the love is mutual... i want one of those pillows as well...
Gray 2.0 says no!
That's a lot of gray
Perhaps even 50 shades?
Perhaps... ah man, too late.
Juvia is adorable. Gray will realize this sooner of later.
Thank you for letting us see both of Erza's eyes.

Juvia really has changed so much since the show first started.
Oh Juvia's hallucinations gotta love em.
Oups silly Juvia left her shipping goggles on lol
Gray is the new Elsa "The cold never bothers me anyway."
