Ichigo is all "Yeah...no big...just took on 6 at once.....*flex*"

Lol I know, even though he's low on power he's still amazing strong...
Lol ichigo wasn't even hollowfied and he took on 6 guys that are all 3rd seat and Lts. So boss. :O
its normal for him after all the strong opponent's he beat in the past, i mean grimmjow, ulquiorra, aizen. these Lts are basically fodder.
I'd find it really suspicious if all of my superiors spontaneously began shooting sparks from their eyes. Nobody in all of Soul Society notice this!?
They should have come up with a symbol or a token they all have or wear to identify each other as the originals
Actually, the fakes do wear something that differentiates them from the originals. They have a bracelet. For example, Renji 03:45. In episode 320, the fake Matsumoto was wearing it as well.
I've got to give Inoue credit for not arguing with Sado when he told her to leave at the beginning. and for immediately healing rukia, matsumoto, and mayuri's Lt. instead of just standing there looking at them
Kenpachi vs Kenpachi. Isn't it a bit early for 2012?
the ending creds...omg... T.T" LOLOLOLOL ukitake.
kon took five episodes to tell her not to go...ichigo took 5 seconds to do that..everyone cant handle their own regai alone...ichigo took 6 of em alon with 1/4 power left! SERIOUSLY?! am i the only one who realises protagonist logic here
Ichigo is so wise. I want a friend like that =p
dang where the captains at aint they supposed to help!
I feel that some of their battles are rushed.
LOL @ head captain lecturing the Reigai Ukitake
renji uses his bankai more than any other soul reaper in this show
What about Byakuya? He uses his bankai in nearly every fight he has =P

how could the head captain not know? He was supposed to be in jail. Those fucking idiots.
Ichigo's power: getting people to trust him
It's funny the way Ichigo, Orihime, and Chad just stand almost motionless and nod their heads at each other while they talk @1:49.
Orihime-chan uses Time Regression Resurrection! It's Super Effective!
what the hell those guys were big deal vs the originals but then ichigo (with diminuished power) comes in and kick there asses...damn hes over powered (well i do remember ichigo did leveled up pretty much with the aizen case but still)
Hope he loses his powers, maybe than we get some interesting stuff.
