Both Naruto and Shippuden are good, you have to respect Naruto as the original show to fully understand shippuden.
Professional Stalker: Hinata Hyuga
Such a great last episode. can't wait to watch shippuden Now Hinata'a to cute near the end
ok now to start shipuden

that's the way to end it with some bad ass gaara >=3

aww poor hinata <3
*reaches arm out* finally... *drags self across floor* done... *dies*
she's gonna dedicate herself "under" gaara alright
WHOA! Calm down, sheesh! LOL
I don't even know who she is??... Lol I skipped from episode 135 to this one because I wanna catch up with Shippuden(I used a guide to avoid fillers)... Maybe I'll come back someday to watch.
I wonder if sand goes in garaa's eyes.....
I was going to say he could just get it out with his sand control but they showed that he struggles to control wet sand so that's actually an interesting question.
These aren't fillers and even if you think they are, you don't need to post it on every episode! I'm tired of hearing that! Ugh! >.<

These are fillers, actually, but that doesn't mean they're terrible. There are too many that hate them, though, and come here solely to bash them. That's what's truly annoying. *sigh*
filler is fine, but for it to overtake the main plot of the series?and even to the point that the filler comes to encompass several episodes adjacent to each other, several times throughout the series it grows to be too much in some cases..
Poor tenten

pretty good! Now it's time to watch Shippuden!
YESS!! Finally done with Naruto and can go on to Shippuden.... I hope Naruto gets some composure as a teenager haha. I'm dead-tired of stupid fillers though D:
Oh my friend the fillers have just began
You can always skip them... If you find a filler arc you like, great, but you can skip what you hate...
Shippuden is when it gets real, I like theyway thy ended this though, bout time t put it in the books, naruto was a great anime i grew up with it, now its history...
8 and a half days of my life gone.. but I finally did it. Off to shippuuden
NARUTO IS THE BEST THE NUMBER ONE ANIMATION EVER!!
like this if your re watching this waiting for the shipuden fillers to end or if you were in between animes or your just feeling nostalgic
