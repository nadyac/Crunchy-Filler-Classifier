Ever notice how the openings now literally spoil and show everything that's going to happen that season?

done with the manga, just waiting for the action part that the manga didn't show
i sat here watching the intro like rip to everyone that has not read the manga
I don't really care if it's a spoiler! That was one of the better intros I've seen for this show in a while.
If I die of old age before we get out of this filler will somene visit my grave and tell me what happens?
its filler with in filler...its basically fillception

I loved this episode. I thought it was perfect, filler or not.
you loved 15mins of sakura-reads-a-book montage? ;_;
^ Yes, I did actually. Sakura started off as being useless. It was really nice to see her trying to move past that point in her life by trying her best at something.
Once they finish this series they seriously should consider re-releasing something similar to DBZ Kai without the fillers.
See also Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood And not just without actual filler episodes but without the ridiculous amount of padding that made its way into canon episodes, slowing down scenes way too much, repeatedly overexplaining things etc
Its better then One Piece. They just do 7 minute intros, on top of the ending. At least a filler episode isn't a tease, its clearly not made to be the actual flow of the plot.
DBZ Kai is such trash, please never try to make anything like that wretched garbage again. Hhahahaha people actually watch dbz kai thats great
Anyone else remember that Naruto is kind of dying right now?
Humph.i think i WILL forget pretty soon
wow a whole episode based on one memory. ugh this is going to take forever... hey that cloud reminds me of this...fills a whole episode. noooo!!!!
Is it just me or did this feel like a filler episode inside of a filler arc?
fillerception
@stormed81 - So... Fillception?
RELEASE! shit, I don't think it worked
Were caught in the infinite tsukuyomi, we clearly need someone else to save us at this point
sasuke and naruto need to save us kuz we dont wanna become white zetsu in infinite tsukoyomi
Because I KNOW you can't wait to see another filler! 8TYXNVHT8AG UH394MM7J9C MP88DRPWADV QJHN7KDV39M

I like the new opening and ending.. but the fillers man.. ..it doesn't fit the fillers at all since it's canon.

That Uchiha madara greatness in the ending
Seriously, that ending is literally the best thing I've seen in this show in like three months. I am going to have such a ladyboner for Madara when he finally fricking gets back into the show.
That ending though... It's like they had the idea of what they wanted to animate for it before they got the song or something... Then got this cheerful-sounding song and said, "Meh, screw it. Going with this dark stuff anyway" XD Pretty fun
Awkward moment when a show doesn't want to end so it desperately holds onto even the least cared about characters from the series.
New ending, naughty Madara and that cheeky smile

Don't forget Asuma-sensei from way back!
awwww new intro
Guy sensi with mooostash o_o

If you've read the manga, then you know who that man with the mustache is.

Lmao. Where is Naruto? I'm guessing there going to make a Filler for every single character god damn dude..
They're officially teasing us with that new opening. fml.... Will this arc ever end?
It'll end as soon as people stop whining about fillers. So at the current rate of whining, never. Also, assuming they're going to cover the whole exam, the third test is yet to come, so I'd expect filler for the next 3 months or so.
Atleast the opening and ending are <3
We get a new intro about the war but they might as well as made the intro for this stupid filler thats probably going to be 24 episodes...
This is a filler flashback within a filler flashback. No progress made on the filler plot arc. What main plot arc? Those don't exist.
the spoilers in that opening good thing i read the manga soo awesome opening
The people who are rating this 5 stars are part of the problem!
lol love that new ending xD portraying madara as the protagonist trying to help everyone with the E. tsukuyomi lmao at least thats how i saw it hahaha
notice me senpai <3
