Take off your clothes. Awkward pause and silence. Because our pool's completed! Just, lol.
i fell for that too, hook line and sinker.

Should mark this post as a spoiler comment so that it can get other people as well.
Red that comment right as it was happening. Fucking shit
i thought he was going to do something disturbing but then he shows a pool i was like bruh
Fairy Tail exploded from awesomeness... It just couldn't contain it...
(when all else fail put Lucy in a skimpy outfit ect ect)
(My favourite rule xD)
I love how at the slightest provocation natsu and lucy will destroy a whole city block w/o any care for the non magic people in the area. "Did someone say fight!?!? Roar of the fire dragon!!!!" "what are you fighting about guys?" "no clue."
(gray must get rid of his close as much as possible etc etc
HOW FAST ARE THE PEOPLE THAT FIX THE CITYS CAUSE IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN A DAY TO FIX A CITY THAT BIG
apparently zerefs death magic also effect flash player ;-;
Dx NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Heresy!
@mythcidaedra really that's sick

LOVED THAT MOMENT XD
Is it sad that i dont even notice when gray strips anymore?
Hahaha that's exactly what happened to me. I'm so used to see him naked that it doesn't even faze me anymore.
Everyone be quiet! This is the best part!! *stares at blank screen :3*
then dont watch them...
the sad part is this isn't a filler exactly xD it was in the manga xD
Haters gonna hate.
that mad me laugh @seeker303
This was the best filler episode ever. Well, technically it's an expanded omake.
Apparently Crunchyroll servers were stolen by Natsu as well.
Oh, what do you know..I can watch it perfectly fine on Funimation...man CR, get your shit together already and update this flash player.
Simple the Servers caught fire so Natsu ate the fire but then Gajeel not wanting to be left out devoured the metals
So I think Frosch was in charge of bringing the video to CR today, that explains the delay

Fro thinks so too
Lucy, you got some 'splainin' to do!
The amount of time we've been waiting, the episode would just be finishing now...let that sink in...
I know, it hurts


NALU!!! <333
I feel trolled =.= I was super excited and then no video.....
*Screams* Y U DO DAT!?!?!??!
This Blank Screen of Death isn't letting me get my weekly dose of Fairy Tail Friday
Fairy Tale watched the viewers. We are the most interesting viewers in the world.
Maybe it's not a blank screen. Maybe it's steam blocking never ending fan service?
But there is no sound
the frequencies are too high for us to hear
D:
