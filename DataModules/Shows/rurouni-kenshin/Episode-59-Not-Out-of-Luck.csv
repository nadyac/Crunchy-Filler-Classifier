LOL Kenshin is going super sayian xD
lmao i was literally just going to comment and say the same exact thing
Can someone please tell houji to shut the hell up. Im about 12 minutes into the episode and hes just blabbering on and on
come on his only joy in life is getting a man boner for mr bandages let him be lol
^
Goodness, Kenshin's and Shishio's eye colors are all over the place. Red, yellow, purple, white/none...
Good anime really messes with my sleep schedule...
I don't think Houji knows how the human body works...comparing it to a steam engine, yeah.... =/
Am I the only nasty pervert who started wondering about how Shishio and Yumi have sex? Anyone? ...What, just me? Damn it *hides in shame*
Isn't it natural to wonder about something like that? I'd be surprised if he still has his "parts", but with the way he kissed her, maybe he does. I suspect she used to be a sex slave, so perhaps her body has a high pain tolerance?
you could say "woooo hoooooo hooooo they sex is on fire" lol
Uh... or... like... maybe they don't? That's what I assumed. Why should they?
If they do it's just disgusting because Shishio is just so creepy. But if they do then... Considering the way they kissed they must love eachother very much... Or.. Something.. Yea.. I dunno
well if you look at his croth area there doesn't appear to be any 'features' and i don't think hes wearing cloths under his bandages
Yumi should get a bucket of cold water and throw it over Shishio. Shishio wouldn't be happy, but at least Yumi could worrying.
That sudden change in temperature can't be good for a body.
holy **** sano's hand
Shishio's thought: Damn they all got white eyes, I'm not defeated but I'll have white eyes too!
The Flashback scene of Kaoru and Kenshin.. I seriously loved that scene. The fight on the other hand.. KICKS ASSSSSSS XD
gotta love Kenshin
Houji is the most annoying side talker I've ever come across. I wish he would stop talking so much. -__-;
All I can think is how much I want to punch that bastard Houji. His face and his hair scream "PLEASE PUNCH ME I AM A TOOL". That sad, serious bad ass fight.
Hmm I didn't know that Rurouni Kenshin was added to Crunchyroll. Where have I been?
This is an awesome episode!
