that ladder though lolo
There was an episode way back that showed were Ten Ten got her ninja weapons from. She bought some from some skilled weapon smith and then sealed them away.
o chaaa
She'd be great at Lemmings. I miss that game.
I don't know what was worse. That ladder jutsu or the blanket jutsu where this girl just wraps someone in a blanket a few episodes back. lol
blanket jutsu

yea.. tentens such a boss LOL

It NS, people are fall down cliffs, mountains, evil lairs, bridges, etc. TT's ladder is a swiss army knife! Wide across to let many move as a group, it's huge steps make it hard to hit & it distributes weight evenly to keep it afloat.
Gaara using taijutsu? Now I've seen everything.
Did Lee handle a rasengan?
@blist1989 yes, he was worried he wouldn't be able to but Naruto's cloak was supporting it. All the others had to do was guide their respective rasengans.
It actually makes a lot of sense, since two taijutsu users- Lee and Sasuke- gave him a lot of trouble during the last exams.

...Lee, Sasuke and let's not forget Naruto did the Konohagakura's Hidden Secret Taijutsu Technique: One Thousand Years of Death lol Gaara sure was traumatized by tajutsu
Someone in the same situation as Rock Lee? Interesting.
she must have a huge house somewhere. but i beleave they showed naruto having to buy his ninja tools once. maybe it was a filler i dont remember but still, after throwing away tools at the rate she does, how can she afford it?
the rent on the warehouse storage lol
i miss rock lee in the original naruto.. in shippuden we dont those traits that he possessed in the original naruto (such as ability to never give up)
well... lee nearly ended gaara in that fight as well, he was lucky with that last layer of sand and lee hurting himself.
I'm guessing Shira has weights wrapped around his legs as well?
lol Tenten, I wonder what she doesn't have in those scrolls...
lmao xD
lol >.>
@ckrjs94 omg that was great
Lmao
Yeah but with her Tools Summoning would she need a man? I mean think about /Dildo no Jutsu! and be scarred for life!
Don't tell me, next week, fillers within fillers
Fillerception continues.
lolololololol
It is the 400th episode, too
Thanks Ten-Ten. You're so....useful.... yay...Ten-Ten...
Naruto!
orochimaru!
Jiraiya

Madara!!
Naruto, which character is he. It's been so long.

Your surprised that a female ninjutsu user has something that gets big, hard, and long at her beck and call? WHAT?! I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LADDER!!!
Lol
oh great next week a filler of a filler.
so next episode they will be having flashbacks when they are already in a flashback... come on
I think this episode could of been Shredders back story from TMNT.
7DXGKGVXC65 one more! -Guard
More proof this episode that Neji is the best of the Hyuuga clan.
With all these fillers, I'm starting to get a hang of it and just have fun watching it.
The episode was too short *insert crying and tantrum*
