This translator probably had the time of their life during the Pi sequence.
It never continuously repeats. There's only 10 different numbers any digit can hold 0-9. But it doesn't ever converge to a single repeating number for an infinite decimal. As far out as it goes the numbers keep changing eventually.
Actually, since pi goes on indefinitely there is every possible number sequence contained within it, including an encoded .jpeg of you making out with a polar bear.
It's not too bad since it's only numbers 1-9. ichi ni san yon go roku nana hachi kyuu
are we really arguing over an infinite number
I can think of less useful ways to spend my time.
"Our weakness is that we're morons." If that's not a great line from anime, what is?
Umm only kill if you are willing to be killed > everything
"If you want to survive, don't die" - AGK
"A true man never dies, even when he is killed!"
"president Rias Gremory's virginity is mine!!"
You never know what the future holds, its potential is limitless!
I've watched this episode about 3 times now and I love the small attentions to detail in the animation of this show. O_O her fingers are even in the right places for guitar chords.

I've seen anime that have just moved the hands up and down, but never like this. I love it. Also, it adds the effect sometimes, where it almost look real.
It was wonderful to see the hand placement and execution of the scenes!

K-On was also pretty accurate when it came to how characters played their instruments. Although that's the whole point of the show, so I guess it's to be expected.
lol
Sad thing is, for this entire season, Iwasawa was by far my favorite character.
The feels from the song haha.... Damn!
lmao the casle from laputa castle in the sky and the castle from howls moving castle all blured out
i love it when animes make references to other animes
That's why i recognised those!
I was supposed to clean my room, but ehm ... I can't really "find time" for it. Ehm. ... *cough* *cough*
Damn, who knew Math was so powerful?
Can we just take a second to appreciate that everyone's always serious and planning and then the camera pans and you just see the American dancing and talking to himself just having a grand old time?
THAT BALLAD. I cried. ;u;
i love the piano for the intro
You must listen the violin version of My Soul, Your Beats! by TAM in the Key Classic CD
stop! this episode made me cry!!!!!! Iwasawa was my favorite character </3 :'( But this is an awesome show! so glad i found it!!!
I wonder why blondie blind fold guy (I froget his name) always speaks English... were others wondering that two or am i just stupid... Lol!
Finally! character in this anime (let alone all the anime i watch on this website) that speaks english!!!!
He's pretty slick. With all those "OOOHHH YEAAAAH"s and "LET'S DANCE!", I'm really enjoying him lol.
He speaks really decent English too
I'll second that, one thing I have noticed is that English words are kakkoii (cool) in Japan. Therefore it is cool to use them in speech or to have in band names. I saw a store on Harajuku St. that had tons of Engrish t shirts.
The voice actor is actually American, which is why he speaks English well
LOL MACROSOFT XO!!!! LOL!
"wingding"
So, if Microsoft is flat, then Macrosoft would be..
Did anyone else freaking cry on this episode... i cried fucking twice and i rarely cry...

Howl's Moving Castle and Castle in the Sky?! This guy has taste! X3
This episode made me shiver a bit..
Trust me every episode will do that to you
is it just me or did anyone else catch that Iwasawa was MIA in the ending group scene?
Yeah, Christ was standing where she was.
I had a feeling they would do that; it emphasizes the point that someone important is gone forever.
Yes, our weakness is that we're morons, LOLOLOL....
the ending broke me, i wasnt ready for that feel this early in the anime.. ;~;
