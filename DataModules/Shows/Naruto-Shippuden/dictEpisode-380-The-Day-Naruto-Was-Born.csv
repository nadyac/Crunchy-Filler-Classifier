get taste flakes but dont get extra special taste gets adding milk extra special taste feels naruto happy 600th best show known mankind many more episodes come hopefully~ do more fillers may carry into 2016 well see lol wish would add actual storylineenhance fights would nice see more example madarahashirama fight scenes previous episode were not manga but were an excellent addition well depends whos reading it; 10 minutes one person could more like 20 another guess but episode got way less done than previous few episodes thats sure estimated end time naruto keep up way end 2015 early 2016 brb gotta go wipe tears hug parents ikrthey played goddamn scene again am tired crying all day today just got done marineford one piecei feel like pregnant woman lololol always play same scenes over over again cried lot during marineford arc too its so emotional doe like part where coby screamed navy about merciless not alone crying department part lets just say lol dude cried like bitch during marinefordno movietvshowanime ever done only thing came close scene end episode but originally played itthat whole episode episode tobirama tsun 98 dere not only rama whom applies what doing making tear up again god great show cant wait next week those damn ninjas cutting up onions thought sec kushina would give him sex talk too but well its good thing naruto standing left minato would quite awkward otherwise noooo intro so full spoilers last intro did same thing lol yep showed everything smh everyone reads manga lol isnt what opening suppose do show whats come next arc story mean look other animes really think about first opening any anime spoilers like way finally sensible point think every opening except extremely metaphorical ones like op8 spoils stuff about upcoming arc think about wouldnt cool only metaphorical openings new opening song cinematic owns song decent lets gooo can understand why people like opening go but personally one least favorite series; mean wasnt training jiraiha not sure spell name master rasengan seems unfitting thearc its called fighting dreamers no its not name song go by flow still dont understand why people think its called fighting dreamers even though would decent name song well probably because phrase first english lyrics song sticks out people who too lazy andor uninterested look up actual name song lol second longest anime running one best well 2nd longest running anime sense doesnt seperate main story; while ash pokemon tries catch em all by catch em all mean catch like 80700ish still takes him six different cont cont regions six different series cover dont seem follow main story just main goal why did get downvoted saying i0un forgot about anime one piece running longer than naruto people faggots its called having arcs naruto too most shows opening pretty much saying yoijustwanttoremindyallthattheshowisabouttoend omg thinking same thing smart man goddamn ninjas cutting up onions front qaq not once but twice episode damn ninjas onions
