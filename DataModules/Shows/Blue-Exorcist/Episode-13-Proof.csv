hair clip.. shit just got real
Frostshade I just faced palmed at your comment. WE JUST SAW HER KICK HIS ASS, so tell me how he would kill her also he knows he needs the help to get stronger.

They stopped the anime?
yes
couldn't agree with u more!
it takes a real secure man to put one of those things in his hair XD
reminds me of turning the hat backwards, if you know what I mean lol
^ Pokemon *-*
na she needs a smaller top just saying and GOD DAM SHES HOT
NOT REALLY WITH THOSE WEIRD EYES
Every memorable character has something they do. In pokemon it was Ash's hat turn, now it is Rin's hair clip.
What can ya say, hair clips are manly!
I wouldn't say the hair clip is symbolic. It was just something Suguro gave him in an earlier episode cause he had a problem reading cause of his hair in front of his eyes. Putting it on just means he's ready to read.
excuse me madam but your boobs seem to be pouring out of your top and it is very distracting -_-
there was to much boobage in this episode
I am still wondering how she kept all that under a hoodie and a bunch of bandages, pretending to be flat chested.
Yeah, it has to be some kind of dark magic.
I mean, I could tell she was a girl from the first time she spoke.
Write a comment...Yeah, it has to be some kind of dark magic.
All these flashbacks on Shiro is making me miss him. And i like Rin's hair with the hair clip. It's cute. XD
Hair clip means he's serious.

Wanna make sure the TSA can't keep you from bringing your sword onto a plane? materialize it out of your chest.
I dunno if the TSA would allow that chest on a plane.
lol
I would love to have a cat like that
A cat like Kuro or a cat like Bikini-Lady?... >_>
i luv the ANIPLEX part that's always at the beginning
IKR it's so fucking intense!
shiro is boss. light cigarette. shotgun bitch. bang.
His Dad is pretty awesome..
Excuse me M'am....your bikini top seems to be a little too small...it scares the children.
Interesting, how they characterize Shiro through mainly flashbacks.
? They characterized Shiro in the first few episodes. The time we saw him alive, we saw him in his prime. At his truest, most vulnerable moments.
@ruebeus But they're doing it more, with feeling!
that girl is really bothering me she should put a shirt on or something
The new opening is kind of refreshing but I like the old ending way better.
I like the new one better
Strange, the new first opening is better, and the new ending is better. Complete opposite for me.
I agree, new OP is good. But miss ready for the take off already.
19:04 Shiro would make an EPIC dad.
oooh now things are getting serious, the hair clip is on!!!
Holy ridiculous boobs, batman!
"I broke my ribs on purpose, now im gonna get taken care of by a nurse with huge breasts!" xD i love dat shit,
