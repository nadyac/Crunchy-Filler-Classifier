why is it that at 3:53 it says wing slash of the sky dragon when natsu is doing wing slash of the fire dragon...
Bad translation I guess
subing anime is basicly giveing you a way to F*** up grammer and get paid for it
what about when he did the wing slash and got roar written in the subtitles
XD
he's a wizard he dont give a shit about magic rules or none of that crap he just yells to power is it that hard to believe he can pull random spells or whatever out of his ass at any given moment
They need to fix the translation. So many thing incorrect with natsu's moves.
This arc could have easily been made into a Fairy Tail movie.
Couldn't every arc?
i super agree
This was not really that good of a story, I cannot wait until they great back to the real manga story.
What caused everything to happen? Where did that energy core come from?
The eclipse gate kinda wished the story was better the celestial spirit look changes deserve a better story! but indeed the energy core part is still a mystery that must me left to the stars
Wohoo its finally over. Though I wish someone other than natsu is the hero. :| lets get someone who is NOT in the spotlight to be the final hitter for one.
I agree with the ending. This arc severely disappointed me as well. Celestial spirit king sucks up all the side characters. Then the support character randomly hit stuff while Natsu goes super sayan because he ate something random again.
I believe its something like it's about Lucy and her telling the story of her time in Fairy Tail following Natsu's story.
Well this time Natsu ate something random that was NOT a dragon move and he didn't get sick from it. I'd say that's an OP ability.
@planetwarrior I agree, meaning Lucy is the main character of this anime due to is about her life story and pretty much every arc revolves around Lucy; however, Natsu is the one that does all the ground work........................
Lucy's still the main character. Natsu is basically the Deuteragonist, which can be seen as second most important character, or co-MC.
finally this filler arc is done
It will be followed by another filler arc, have you seen the intro?
^ Nope, the next episode is from the manga and the sun village arc is an arc in the manga.
Is it just me or did Happy get an 10pt. intelligence stat boost or what? He was actually talking smart this episode. (o_O)
Natsu's branching out, he did a Roar of the SKY Dragon in the first bit. :p
His first step to becoming Omni dragon destroyer of worlds. j/k
He also used wing slash of the sky dragon
GIVE US TARTAROS OR RIOT
There is also the next episode,where natsu babysits :l
The next episode is based on a one-shot chapter, and the Tartaros Arc begins in the Spring season. Be prepared, it will be a MAJOR GAME-CHANGER!
There aren't anymore "filler" the next episodes will be from Specials. Extra chapters (double chapters) and the sun village arc.
@Thekiduzumaki I don't read the manga but what is the sun village arc. That picque my interest
@gonzalez007 The sun village arc is the arc leading up to Tartaros arc. The arc is about Natsu and the gang taking an s rank quest from one of the gods of Ishgar (The top 4 mages in the Ten Wizard Saints). Wont say anymore to avoid spoils.
I love how there are the people who are happy they did the thing and fixed the stuff and then the people who are freaking out over the next arc.
Don't any of you think that was TO easy?
Yeah, a bit anti-climactic, don't you think? Also, what happened to Ophiuchus? Is she gone for good?
its filler so of course its going to be easy.
Who else counted down to the last 5 seconds?

someone spoiled that for me at school and i started to cry:(
thsh1 what a dick!
I shed a tear at the end of this.
Sort of meaningless to spoil it further right?...
I was shedding tears during the whole exchange. Makes it all the more real.
That "Grin" lol
And while happy for the world at large, it is with great sadness that we must say farewell to Loli Aquarius
The preview for the next episode... If you have read the manga chapter that it's from you should be freaking out as much as I am..
same, I can't wait!!!
Looking forward for it too I read that manga part over and over for a hole day, so It's gonna be amazing to see it animated.
21:20 The Symbolism was not lost on Manga readers. I am sad.
GRIN! That part actually surprised me this episode. And finally, fillers are over. Hope the next arc will be better.
DAMN! That was One HECK of a finisher! Just imagine THAT move while in Dragon Force! O_O
