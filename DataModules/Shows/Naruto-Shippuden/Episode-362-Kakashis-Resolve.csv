lol Kurama lends Naruto the experience & reason he sometimes can keep hold of. It makes perfect sense, he's still so young. Kurama's awesome

Feels good to be back!
"its not a filler if its in the manga" ... by what rights does a manga claim immunity to the posability of fillers? they are EXACTLY like TV in the fact that they HAVE to come up with so much story line so often or be cancelled.
Saying it cant be a filler because its in the manga is like saying "he cant be racist because he is black" the 2 things have nothing at all to do with each other so stop saying that! ANYTHING can have filler just like ANYONE can be racist.
It's not filler because it's giving more insight to the current problem.
When people say fillers, they specifically mean "content not in the manga", not just "content to fill up time." By definition, stuff in the manga can't not be in the manga, so it can't be filler.
There seems to be a bit of confusion about what filler is. Filler is original content created by the animation studio that was not in the manga. Usually to allow time for more content (manga) to be released. Like mid-season OVAs

They're doing Madara's job for him. It would be hilarious if the 10-tails were only an illusion, and they destroyed the shinobi world trying to "kill" it.
I would rather kill a very small country than the whole world. I may feel guilty for a VERY long time but at least we got a big part of the world left.
lt's Man of Steel all over again... destroying more then the enemy itself...
A lot of farm animals, were harmed during the filming of this episode. I'm sure P.I.T.A. will whine about it later....


Having seen the manga, well....I'd feel sorry for Godzilla.
Are you kidding? It looks like a wiggly turnip.
and badly animated, hopefully it will be better animated in the next episode this episode was low budget
i some what agree petaltoad, but the feels in this episode.
How is it "bad animated"? "Low budget"? Did you even WATCH the episode?
The Nine tails is such a troll :p
yah hehe ... he likes Neurto-maki in his Ramen
i knew it couldn't just end like that with the ten tails not reviving :p

I love you Kakashi~~~~~~ I shall protect you! And the Juubi is ugly.
NO NO NO MORE I CANT WAIT ANOTHER WEEK you are wors then oricimaru
haha yea even im excited!
Naruto manga/anime is King of TROLLING, you should be used to it by now.

ffs ahaha id like to see any of you try and kill your best friend stop acting like it's a plot hole. He said he was prepared to protect Naruto but he said NOTHING about killing obito.
Maybe because he was in the other world and killing him from there could have stranded him or something
Did you guys not just watch this episode or what? They clearly stated that Kakashi is low on chakra and that he probably wouldn't be able to kill his old friend. He couldn't use lightning blade if he wanted to...
Nine tails could give him chakra-.-


Um... turn?
Haha. That shuriken attack was the slowest thing ever too.
Like watching No game no life again :p
they always end it when it gets good

Makes this fight so much better after watching the mini Kakashi series.
normally i would agree with you Vicky (about the filler stuff) but imo it was a rare "good" arc which dont happen often, and helped add more back story and depth. least it wasn't a mid-fight hey lets go babysit a princess or chibi arc's.
@Omen I would like to agree with you on that, but having skipped it, I wouldn't know. I just know that I am really burnt out on fillers. I just can't handle any more of them. Still, getting cussed out for not liking them seems juvenile.
yeah that was a lil much too. but you should at some point check it out if you skipped it. i hate fillers too but very rarely they are good. (very rare) lol
Most of the fillers now actually add depth and understanding of the characters and make the following story much more meaningful and tense. Skipping these types of fillers only deprives yourself of part of the experience, enjoy. =/
Awww YEAH, Naruto main story is back in teh house! @Gore23, were it elsewhere in the storyline it'd be great. But smack dab in the middle of the grand epic finale is just a damn annoying spot to put it, delaying things by 3 frakin months!
So what are they fighting about I forgot..... HAHAHA
Wish I could tell you guys why Kakashi really killed Rin. But if you read last week's manga, everything is explained!
A really predictable explanation, if you ask me...
They were suppose to be over 14 because Obito failed the chunnin exam and retook it. So they were about 16, technically adults in Japan and available to consent any "activity" of that matter. They were small compared to the new Generation.
They look the same exact age as Konohamaru in Part 1. Snot nose, missing tooth, and whatever's wrong with the girl.
ROFL w/e is wrong with the girl ty that made my day


Obito! cover me for a second while i do this!
You know its about to go down when the first 5 minutes of an episde start right off the bat.....then the intro XD
It's usually the other way around actually; if they play the intro straight away it won't interrupt the flow and it's typically an amazing episode when they do that.
After reading the manga, I can appreciate these episodes a lot more now than I normally would
I'm always confused at the fighting scenes because many panels are just rubble flying everywhere, so it's hard to tell what the hell is happening.
In honor of a return to the main story; X4MQYAKFUMX, 6RCXB7XVUYG, and HJUHFZGUFQK. Enjoy.
Thanks, I took the First one
2nd one, Thanks
Two More!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6JJ3X98KAAR VBF4CB4W97E
Thanks! took the first...
what are these codes ?
Amazing and a breath taking episode.Nicely done!
This is the first time since a long time that I anticipated a Naruto episode!
Agreed.
Baka! How could you not look forward to a series containing all our favorites?! Kakashi in every episode, along with Yamato and Itashi?!
LOL Itashi.
yamato? isn't he that guy that only exists in the kakashi chronicles?
dude, that ten tails is so fucking ugly in the anime
I don't like obito's voice, it kinda sounds like orochimaru. I want the old voice back!

@jmc0228, spoiler tag please for those who are not caught up with the manga, thank you.
Maybe he should go back to Tobi's voice?
Tobi's voice is really "swirly" Zetsu's voice. BTW what happened to this poop-loving guy, he was funny!
@ishida617 that post had a spoiler tag since I post it, are you sure you didn't just click "show spoiler"?
