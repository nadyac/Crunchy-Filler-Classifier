Haizuki may like stealing, but NO ONE steals food from Murasakibara, not even one pickle.
What chemical spill occurred in this town to give all these basketball players super powers? o_o

@Briaria It was an overflow...of chemical Y ;-)
I dare anyone to try. He'll crush you.
**LOL* Truth. Wait... what is her name again??? the pink haired girl... Murasakibara's former manger.. he might just give it to her right? MAYBE? :XD Murasakibara can eat my foods. I need to lose weight!! **sob** Just give me KISE ^_^
He stole Kise girlfriend? This guy needs to get destroyed in basketball
pretty sure the girl deserves to be destroyed aswell. in basketball
Doesnt the captain of Haizuki's team look like Kiyoshi? Is it Kiyoshi's long-lost twin brother?!
i thought i was the only one
Okay so Haizaki is a total turd blossom, but the way he says Ryota's name is surprisingly sexy...I feel conflicted.
I though that was just me. Ryota just rolls off his tongue.
damn, they were buff middle schoolers
turd blossom... sounds like something you find in your underwear after too much tacobell...lol
^ Or after you face Aomine-kun in The Zone lol

I literally YELLED this when me and my friends watched it.
i might have laughed a little to hard at this comment X'D

Been waiting all week for this!
Crunchyroll are 2 episodes late.... you may want to find 53 and 54!
2 weeks late or not, I prefer watching on Crunchyroll whenever it's on Crunchyroll. I started this on Daisuki, and then waited 2 weeks to watch it on CR instead.
Just Finished watching ep 54 it was epic!!! Crunchyroll needs to catch up.. seriously.
CR can't "catch up" because they are being told to wait two weeks before putting the episodes up.
Haizaki didn't even have to meet Kise to know that he'd be good and that they'd hate each other. His hunch was spot on. He's definitely not the nicest guy around but he knows what's up.
I'm oddly ok with them being 2 eps behind, I just watch it when each new episode comes out during the weekend via CR, as long as they are up in hd 720, 1080 whatever!

why the hair tho
You know...when I look closely at Haizaki with his hair loose, he could pass for Kuroko's older brother...sans the maniacal scowl of course.

what are these?
The people complaining about being episodes behind need to just Google it or maybe pay attention
Damn I really can't stand him

When I watched this before it came to crunchyroll they translated it to "Pillaging moves", sounds so much more hardcore

TYZQHXRRHJA, 8GM9ZVZFEBN man i cant tell who i hate mire haizuki or that one guy that keeps injuring ppl
I wish they didn't try and make every moment so dramatic, it really loses it's effect when it is needed most. If every scene is a climax, the main climax won't seem as good as it could be, because the contrast is minimal.
haizaki is mr steal yo girl
7:29 That is a nice drive ("respect your elders" haha), even though he didn't finish himself, I like it.
Nice teamwork with Kise too x3
