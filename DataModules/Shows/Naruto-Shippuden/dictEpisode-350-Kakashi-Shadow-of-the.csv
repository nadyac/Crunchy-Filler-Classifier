think all undermining narutos growth terms who grown most obito seriously bought into madaras goal create 10 tails make genjutsu would bringpeace into world remember wants bring rin back live within genjutsu well so probly thought same minato what even point tossing flowers aside what understand obito doesnt see kakashis side all all knows saw kakashi kill rin hates him probably thinks kakashi putting flowers rins grave an insult rins memory here thought left kakashi alive because actually enough sense realize kakashi would never kill rin unless no choice so much assuming basic intelligence characters yeah danzo where were all happening haha akatsukis recruitment strategy probably just follow danzo around approach all people left his wake haha skam22 akatsuki were left his wake also just showed danzo screwing over too royalraider thats so funny so true too deep forest emergance danzos face this comment removed haha #rekt 3rd laugh damn kakashis backstory actually really sad his dad killed himself hes reason obito died killed rin then wasnt able do anything save minato thats kind backstory youd expect see villain but didnt see part story everyone goes through dramatic situations its deal turns into hero villain hell yeah so true tragedy ones life does not dictate morality just because lost child among other things does not make bad guy its choice one makes confronted tragedy inevitability death think about wood style pretty boss ability create life force pretty handy thats because able use wood style by implanting hashiramas dna into him but hashiramas style whole other level even madara stole its just not same really dont see appeal why its supposed so strong surely getting struck by lightning burned fire would more damaging than getting twatted branch think about wood style extremely more versatile most jutsus also core1019 wood style can used control tailed beasts dont think itself can make more powerful than rest jutsu actually wood style incorporates water style so fire wouldnt very effective against although guess its anything like combination attacks do occasionally would mainly water strengthening stone writer doing an amazing job making danzo most hated villain history all anime danzo may claimed village but never everything did entirely self serving literal definition evil nay may want power himself but can guarantee hed use power better protect village since thats only thing cares about danzo may seem like cause everything cause alot but realize all protect hidden leaf thats all matters ohim even his way twisted danzo pursued his own ideals contemptuous those who disagreed way very selfish but cant call him selfserving everything did sincere belief would help village not himself kakashis answer everything back then chidori hahahahha just like naruto kage bunshin no jutsuoh man am glad were past those days sasuke mastered better its because sharingan begin but kakashi chidori then got sharingan so still mastered jus took longer plus kakashi create scratch sasuke one worlds greatest teachers learn so chidori basically old school gastuuga eh know its not same thing but same concept love one guy uses telescope defensively holy shit yamato its years since weve seen him isnt yamato currently stuck wall something dont remember care anymore im guessing going refer him tenzou yay next weeks episode looks amazing waiting yamatos back story ages bwahahaha wouldnt expect whole lot about yamato past what already know theres still some room left manga give his story do seem taking some liberties having him work danzo dont recall ever being said manga anime tenzoyamato ever part root assumed because yamato orochimarus shot reviving mokutonstyle jutsu orochimaru danzo were working pretty close since danzo created root gifted child shinobi then why hell not only living person able use woodstyle then again may writers didnt want think bunch just said wellthisfitsnicelyhere jajaja awwww itachi baby sasuki look so cute together why itachis voice deeper than kikasis because born badass lol super like your comment unstopabl3 likeaboss itachi like kakashi gets his own episodes but sakura doesnt shes not worthy anyone wants sakuras backstory here sasukesasukesasukebillboard browbillboard browsasukebillboard brow flick billboard browsasukesasuke dumb bitch entire time sasuketells naruto loves him were back everyone except tenten gets no screen time ever roadtosakura dont remember hen told naruto loves him reason most certainly not just fuck his feelings am lil confused based fact watched over narutos mother during her pregnancy his sensi being narutos dad why kakashi naruto not closer seemed choose sasuke over him its because kakashi knew jiraiya would look after naruto sasuke lost his family just like kakashi walked dead parents front kakashi sharingan eye so can teach him who else plus naruto pretty annoying kid knowing ninetails sealed inside naruto may afraid give him too much power point could not handle other hand maybe fact did not spoil naruto so much reason why naruto positive growth sasukedidnt wasnt favoritism its jus said way more convenient kakashi teach sasuke jiraiya teach naruto cuz jutsusand chakra natures were similar everyone gets sad backstory except danzo orochimaru; just want watch world burn haha good one would lost his arm leg way then ha ha good one full metal alchemist reference ftw orochimaru already lost his arms once unlike certain brothers orochimaru can actually bring back death without any compensation his own body apart using other peoples lives oh well well orchimaru does kind please do episodes day again but point kinda still stands wouldnt rather know whats happening present past considering war going would rather put more appropriate time story want know whats happening present try reading manga id much rather see wellwritten fillers like take place past than those present day war fillers naruto bee were running towards battlefield like months straight id rather episodes regardless even backstory filler cuz think about would air both either way but do then get newer stuff sooner not then wait another week yeah these fillers reason said not part main plotarc doesnt advance plot further automatically making filler wheter consider one not well kakashi ruined by saying those things rins grave out loud way go kakashi tipped obito off kno right thinking same thing saw episode cuz wonder obito would ever known about kushina being pregnant kakashi didnt say anything by rins grave great episode love theyve handle all all diff perspective same events epic cant wait next ep oh gotta say loving side story whys kid itachis voice so much deeper than kakashigais lol
