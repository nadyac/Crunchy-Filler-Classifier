Here's something else that just occurred to me. Asuna's parents experienced over 2 years of Asuna in a coma. Now Asuna is back, but she spends much of her time, at home, online and not with her folks. It must be distressing for them, too.

"family" meaning her parents make her marry a rapist who she has hated her whole life? its over controlling, her mother is making her live a life she doesn't want, basically living through her daughter. Her life sucks
Living through her daughter? You mean like the daughter is living through an avatar on the internet?

They can't be compared, because they are not set up the same way. ALO and SAO could be compared together, but you can't compare any MMO we have to either. With enough skill and reaction speed, fights could turn out much different in these.
@Fried_Twinky Ok in WOW 40 level 1's could graveyard rush me all day while i'm afk, they'd still never kill me. Not sure what kind of naked zero talent points spent paid for levels noob they killed.
For those who are confused about the Sinon reference that Kirito made, it's when he says "Even the fastest magic is slower than an anti-material rifle's bullet", right before the other Guild guy says "G-get into formation". Had to check. XD
We only saw Kirito and Klein, but lets be honest, the only member of the group that was missing was Agil, the rest of them are always on. As soon as those doors closed the rest of the party caught up and kicked the group's ass.
Kirito Kun.kkkkkkkkk.handing out asswoopings!
I love how they called Kirito "Blacky-Sensei" just goes to show how highly regarded Kirito is. xD
Kirito is basically a raid-boss so fighting a group that has little information on his attack styles is kind of one sided.
Okay show of hands... How many of you think Kirito got some from Asuna, Iater that night, IRL? I can see the text she sent in my mind: "You were so cool today....Want to see you...I have a presento."
*hand*
It was cool, too, when one of them recognized Asuna, "Berserk Healer!" right before she skewered their tank and then proceeded to slaughter their own healers. Kirito's and Asuna's legends simply keeps growing.
I like how as soon as he destroyed all the arrows they started treating him like a boss monster and got into formation xD
The way Yuuki broke down in the end..Time to wait for another week. ):
Gabe86: CALLED IT.

damn it would've made sense if it was the girl that he tried to revive back in SAO

@i208ot Death Gun wasn't a girl...

The only thing that would have made that better is if he drew the excalibur as his main, then drew that sword that can pass through other swords as his off, and went "I called in a favor..."
You notice when the leader said 'It's just one guy!' the others still didn't move forward again...

Cuts all your MAGIC with his sword, says it won't work because they're slower than bullets. Which he directly implies he can also cut. Then he pulls out Excalibur. And dual wields it. Alt-Q-Q

Klein saves the day yet again!
Holy Badass Kirito moment. Same goes for Asuna flying through a dozen and a half people.
He hides it unless he needs it. No one likes people coming up and constantly snooping at your gear! Get away!
forget kirito stealing the spotlight! Klein! you the real MVP

10/10 would make Klein Waffles at my place.

3 min against healers and a bunch of dudes after he did his reset is not bad at all just saying. Now if this was before his reset he take them all with ease
@Dakidakine I completely agree! I would LOVE to see them reveal themselves in-game exactly for that effect
@dragonmistress6 I've kinda been waiting for Asuna to reclaim her mantle of Lightning Flash Asuna. If any of those players are worth their salt in VRMMO's, then they will know the names of the two people that cleared SAO.
@JacketsNest101 I completely agree. I myself have been wanting it to happen a couple of times. i can just imagine the looks on their faces when they hear who they are actually teaming with
Guys... guys... Technically it was either JUST Kirito or everyone who was in that last raid. While sure, yes, Asuna saved his butt during the fight, close friends of theirs would take note of that. The vast majority would just know Kirito.
its funny because basically what happened in kirito's head is "huh, they done with the boss fight? k time to go cook dinner"
Yuiiiiiii
did anyone else notice the signatires on the card kirito had two swords crossed and yui... well her face
@SwordsmanShip; I caught that, it was pretty cute. It was nice of Kirito to do that for her.
@Dr_egg1 I think he had just predicted Asuna would convince them to party at their place, knowing her as well as he does. He was probably aware their group wanted to keep to themselves, for what ever reason.
Kirito at least caught the fish.

You guys will know for sure. Trust me, I've read the Light Novels.

wow i thought they were AI or something weird, but that makes way more sense
I will rage if they are all in a coma. that's a terrible plot! I will tear so hard the world is flooded. ;-;
I thought Yuuki's sister died because in the opening, there are two babies. They grow and become kids, then teenagers, but one is only there.
Kirito just pulled a Gandolf.What next is he gonna pull of a "Kirito the white"?
He already has.
No way, he'd have to trade in his black coat. That won't happen.
In arc one he had to trade in his coat for a white one for one episode when he was forced to join the 'Knights of the Blood'
*Oath
If it didn't have such painful memories attached to it for many I could see Asuna and Kirito restoring KotB. Despite whats said, Kirito still holds much respect for Akihiko Kyaba in terms of his abilities.
Don't worry Kirito, we've only waited a week for you to beat some ass.
.... And still didn't get to see him wipe their guild....
I went through around 20 tissues in this episode. Goddamnit it. When you know what is going to happen, this shit is TOUGH to watch. Such a good arc, such good development compared to the other arcs. For my tears: H54D7S8EFYW
ok i dont care to wait some one tell me what is going on!!!
Yea, think on par with the ending of the Chimera Ant arc from HxH. That level of manly tears will be shed over the next 3 episodes, if not more...
Incoming pm Okyou
tellmetoo
GGO is still the strongest arc imo, but 1 and 4 come in a very close second...
WHERE THE HELL IS MY KIRITO AND KLEIN VS HALF THE GUILD FIGHT?!??!?
EXCUSE ME, FORGETTING ABOUT MVP YUI, OBVIOUS STAR OF THE FIGHT jk
Hell, him cutting through magic is enough. Don't push it.
@WrittenShadow has a point here.
Poor Klein. He was fighting so hard too but the camera couldn't see him!
Klein, the backbone of SAO. Always in the background, making sure things get done.
Hey Blacky, you think you can take us?.......... That's my girl, I'm going medieval on your @sses. = )
Hell he really only would have had to ask them 1 question....Have you ever heard of The Lightning Flash? Because if they know her then they know full well who he is and what he's capable of doing to them.
Asuna is an awesome Character I hope this episode helps everyone see that, if you forget what happens in ALO and you read the Novels you have to agree.
Kirito and Asuna.... most BA couple ever
Except we'd hate him for doing that to Asuna.
I personally am still holding out for a menage a trois, even though I know its not happening.
^ !

His sister is on the board tward the top too.
That's what happens when Kirito forgets to turn off his swag. Everyone pretty much dropped what they were doing just to stare at him in awe.
Berserk healer lives! Kirito is still too cool for his own good.
