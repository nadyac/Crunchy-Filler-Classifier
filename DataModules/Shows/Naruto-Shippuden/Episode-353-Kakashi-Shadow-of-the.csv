I really miss that type of fighting animation as they had in this episode


Love the Double Plugger Thongs that Smoke ninja douche bag was wearing..XD!!
The filler's have some great fights from time to time. That one with the "Oldest Genin" while back had a cool fight as well.
Yeah it was really going back the the classics the fight scene was epic.
Did anyone else think that was one of the most bad ass looking fights in this series?

Could have all been over if he just used a wind jutsu...
a fight ?! where ?!! lol
If he could use wind style. Kakashi uses lightning style....
Also miss the soundtracks used in the original naruto...that are essential to a fight scene
Third Wheel Kakashi left behind in a log... 4ever alone XD
haha xD
4ever a clone
Lol..
Im actualy really confused to whether yamato is actualy her brother or not...I cant be the only one?
from what I saw it seems more like he is a clone of the real version. If I remember correctly from waaay back when Yamato first appeared I think they said he was clone. Idk tho I could be wrong
Yamato is a clone of the First Hokage's cells, so he looks like every other clone Orochimaru has created basically- Yamato/Tenzo- are basically one of the same in different incarnations. Just that they are not the same personality &thoughts
As a child, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and became one of sixty children that were his test subjects. They were injected with the First Hokage's DNA in the hopes that they could replicate the First's ability to use Wood Release.
I Understand More Now Owo of yamato that ish...
How violated would you feel, having a woman inside you, against your will?
isn't that what marriage is?
Wouldn't be too bad as long as that woman wasn't doing shit she shouldn't
I feel like this is some awkward version of gender swapping, she could even feel was his body felt.............. Oh god no ><
"Sex With Google Glass"
Then again, that could be what you're into.
im starting to like this filler arc.. what have you done to me Kakshi!
Who leaves a 10yr old to do an interrogation..
No one. That's why they didn't.
Well when that 10 year old is an elite member of your nations army...
What civilized society would train children to be soldiers? It's cruel, actually. Even if it makes for great anime entertainment, but when you really think of it, Konoha is just as cruel & evil as any others that exploit children.
Today, sure. But back then, you weren't expected to live much past fifty if you were lucky. People were expected to perform in their physical prime. How someone 'felt' about it didn't mean anything.

I can't believe Kakashi, a black ops agent would lose a sword fight against a peasant.
look at the skill of the peasant...
Did you not see the way that dude handled a sword? He obviously knows his shit, no reason he shouldn't give Kakashi a run for his money.
My god, Yamato's eyes are sooooo creepy.
That's the point... XD
Anyone that can keep up Kenjutsu with Hatake kakashi is one bad ass mofo in my book

The guy is their clan leader its no surprise he would give Kakashi a hard time. And Kakashi would have critically injured him like 5 times in that sequence if it werent for his kekkei genkai. He might as well have been fighting Obito...
That, and you are forgetting we are watching Kakashi as a kid, damit!
And this clan leader was trained by Orochimaru...
Yes yes it is a double episode. You you get to see how and why Kakashi and Tenzo are friends.
Hello cruel black ops world out threre.
This just isn't Kakashi's day.. That smoke jutsu is some really nasty stuff
yukimi eating everything was adorable
Oh hell yea I'm so ready for Kakashi and Yamato goodness
poor third wheel kakashi
Is it just me or does anyone else want Kakashi's ANBU mask?
that village was FUCKING OP!!
Noob Saibot vs. Smoke...FIGHT!
