It's why I sleep with an old bayonet under my pillow. I'm not a woman, so the threat of rape isn't as high (not saying nonexistent), but a robber or murderer will have a surprise waiting if he tries anything.
2 rapey 5 me
I got a life size replica of Frostmourne from wow above my bed. Any robbers or murderers will be running miles with me chasing them
WoW is really fun, and Frostmourne is an awesome sword.
aka the show's fanbase
I now understand why Klein and the detective avoid taking up screen time. All non-Kirito men end up as psycho perverts when given enough screen time. It's basic survival that men characters run from the camera or lose their soul.

@stardude692001, You just summed up the popularity of this show in 1 sentence. While I still love it, it does have some pretty bad writing when it comes to character interactions.
Can you blame them if they turn crazy? ALL THE GIRLS ARE ADORABLE DAMMIT!
@firedestroyer, how can you be so sure that Klein isn't a love interest of Kiritos? Klein had a thing for Kirito in the beginning, but later realized that Kirito only has eyes for Asuna, he's just like the rest. ~.^
"You either get small screen time as a hero, or get enough screen time to become a rapist" -teh joker
That grenade scene is arguably the best comical scene in this new season, so far.
My Sinon can't be this deadly cu...boom!
The gang just at there and watched them win together. I wander what they were thinking
it explained in the LN i think. Asuna wasn't too happy lol.
All you guys saying, "I knew it was him!" Bullshit! LOL Unless you read the novel. Everyone really suspected the nurse. LOL
who needs war when you have present grenades?
Must of been so weird to record that in the studio
Well you think this is bad? How about voice actors for hentai? You have a bunch of girls voicing girls being raped, torn apart, giving birth to aliens, etc...this is mild if anything XD
@hatoriku MEN!!!!
Hahaha! Have you guys ever seen Koe De Oshigoto? XD
I bet this was a time they felt like recording separate sessions.
"So for this next scene, we need you to sound like a fanatic who is caressing their life size pillow of their favorite idol"

Enough with the half-ass jokes guys
It's OK, Angelzor! Making half-ass jokes means we like SOA (and it's characters). It's NOT liking SOA that makes someone a COMPLETE ass.
Sword Online Art?
Had to thump it up to 700 lol classic.
SOA would be Sons Of Anarchy...
Shinkawa: "Asada-san. Asada-san! ASADA-SAN!!!" Kirito: *DROP KICK* "Get off of bitch #342!"
Tsk tsk it was a knee strike, not a drop kick.
I think it just means that Kirito gets a lot of girls so she might as well be number 342 Bassnova.

kirito so sexy there
I find it funny that Sinon instantly realises who Kirito is in reality and fantasy but Kirito's own sister couldn't make the appearance in ALO yet he didn't even look like a girl that time.

why was he not on IV to begin with?? (granted i do not know how Japanese hospitals operate, but im pretty sure that they should have hooked him up cause the average person is clinically dehydrated most of the time...)
Holy shit no kidding, it bugged me so much that it was literally all I could think of the entire episode lol
Kirito was not a patient at the hospital. It was used as a safe location for him to dive so he could be monitored, because of the potential threat DeathGun was. She was only monitoring him, and she said he at risk, not that he was.
so what if the author wasn't a doctor, it's called a research
So how didn't people die in SAO if their bodies were in that state frequently? Surely being in that state for long periods so regularly would have caused heart failure or something. I always figured their bodies just didn't show exertion.
I wonder what the audience is thinking, when they're watch two people sword fight in a gun game based tournament.
I'm just wondering about how a regular sword can stop a light saber
In Star Wars lore there are swords called Vibroblade. They are able to stop lightsabers. I don't know the details behind it, but they do exist lol. Here's a link if you wanna read up on it. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Vibroblade

@Cloud_Strife_911 They are made from super durable materials, usually Cortosis, but Phrik is not uncommon. Normal Vibroblades are useless against a lightsaber though.
yes but the vibroswords had been charged with high voltage electricity, thats part of the reason why they are so good. and since its just a video game your light saber is just a good baseball bat
That was awesome. What a badass coming in and knee kicks that assface right in his pussy.
Leave it to Kirito to be a badass
such an epic ending to the episode....i want more damn it!!!!
I had a bad feeling about that friend from the start ._.
@Shimoko Don't be such a dick


Yeah, I think the psycho guys in SAO are always a little over done.
I don't think it would have felt over the top to me if he hadn't immediately become permanently covered in shadows in a room where all the other characters are perfectly lit. Yes, animators, I know hes evil now.
I don't think they're over done. Psychotic people are psychotic, and they can literally snap just like that.

I think it was scarier before the creep showed up. After he showed up, I was like, "This is so predictable." -_- "This guy is totally busted."


dont forget the look of his ALO firends hair
I agree everyone! Just priceless!
can some one make a gif of kiritos reaction to the gernade? xD
It should be a meme. How about "Awkward Gift Kirito?"

Here you go ^^ tried my best: http://imgur.com/gallery/4mZvo/new
@Kayoni omg you made a bunch, and it includes the knee to the face, yes! I'm stealing if you don't mind.
That knee to the face was pretty badass.
Focusing back to RL, I'd say that was a strong start.
KIRITO USED HI-JUMP KICK!
Remember kids: Don't lose your shit over a video game. It leads to murder and (attempted) rape.
@sport3888 Oh, you're one of those idiots.Videogames DO NOT cause people to go on murderous rampages. Studies have already proven this claim false, look it up. Do some research instead of eating everything the media spits out like a sheep.
@Falcon132 Actually, it's like how people go crazy after watching anime and go on murderous rampages! Likewise, did you ever notice people that pirate anime tend to watch anime? It's related! Watching anime causes people to pirate anime!
@Falcon132 There isn't conclusive evidence to say whether or not people go on rampages because of video games, though people who go on rampages may have also played those games to begin with and would have been like that without the games.
@Falcon132 Pretty sure he was being facetious anyway...
All a game is going to do is maybe teach you how to load up and shoot a damn gun. Oh and kids, aim for the head.
Sinon used Present!
Kirito used Hi Jump Kick!
x3

Knee strike* not "Hi Jump Kick"
@Brewiz they're Pokemon references, knee strike isn't in pokemon
'I'm one of Death Guns men!' Yeah we've known since the OP of episode 1.

That'll be a much better twist than him as one of the goons.
It would be more of a twist if he were just a normal guy bringing a victory cake to his friend..
lol. so true. saw that coming like a slomo-ed bullet just like in BoB
It was sooo obvious since the OP so I wasn't surprised at all. Damn spoilers....
I bet the people watching the MMO Stream are like "WTF why are talking"
[This comment has been removed]
From their perspective the 2 lovely girls both won the contest. I can see the rational for cheering.
The end was a climax of Yuri love who wouldnt cheer
They were all like "DAMN IT SLAINE-ON"
All the guys watching were thinking "YES, YURI LOVE TRUMPS ALL!!!!"
That kid makes Suguo look sane in comparison.
haha so true
*shortly after Shinkawa is defeated* Time for another heart-to-heart that takes 3 episodes!
First: Beat Death Gun Second: Rejoice and share personal information ;) Third: Welcome your "friend" into your house Fourth: Rape scene??? Fifth: KIRITO SAVES THE DAY, AGAIN!
Sixth: Everyone (except the bad guys) PROFITS.
you got to defend your harem
sixth: a full fledged ass whooping.
Plot twist, Kirito gets raped by both the kid and Sinon
