wtf kenshin and sano taken down by a pack of dogs?
Lol "Christians"
crazy cult...
Awesome line from the crazy God guy when they talk about killing Kenshin "Do you as you like, no one can put him in his grave"
At 5:44 where is kenshi's scar? I don't know why that bothered me so much when I noticed it but its weird.
What is the music playing at 12:52?
moonlight sonata
Ludwig van Beethoven ^^^
wtf why is Karou wearing that shit, she's better off staying at home than tagging along.and Kenshi and Sano got taken down by dogs that don't compared to feats they have accomplished.
