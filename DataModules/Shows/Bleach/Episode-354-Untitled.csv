Recap ends 2:31
Low rating, unfortunately. I don't know why, but maybe it has to do with the horrible filler placing. I don't mind fillers much, but they just love to misplace them.
Omg the fillers made me so angry. Like two episodes of the original and then an entire season of filler. I was ready to throw my comp across the room by the end of it. XD
here is an idea.. skip the filler
Fillers are now called : Bleach killers.
The filler didn't kill the series, it kept it going for a very long time while they worked to get the actual manga covered in the anime. It was the MANGA itself taking a long break that ended the anime. As in the writer had a break.

I nearly lost it when I saw Yukio make Chun Li's stage from Street Fighter II. I'm liking Yukio more and, more. I like how he's always playing his PSP.
Yukio should upgrade to a Vita.
Imagine if Ichigo had been in Sword Art Online...
whoa.... 0___0. True. It would have taken him about a nanosecond to clear top!

Rip you need to learn to keep your mouth shut. I can tell you're gonna be a pain in ass with everyone.
YAY...Rukia! I miss Shinigami already! Enough of fullbringers! LOL.
Looks like Ichigo still has a long way to go.
@vincemikyle I totally agree, I miss the guys who just shake off a lopped off arm or who replace their organs with dummies, or who block a sword with their face
Rukia!! Good to see you again!
RRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUKKKKKKKIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!! UUUURRRRR FINALYY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

I always knew gaming was good for something. I can trap people inside the gamesystem.
The pacing is so much better then in the manga but they are going to have to come up with some filler soon. And I'm glad they did the rukia reveal. It isn't much of a mystery anyway.
