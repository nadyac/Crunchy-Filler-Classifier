these two filler episode is how you do filler right
...to beat Pain. Also was able to convince the real Pain to revive everyone and believe in himself.

I really like these episodes. I enjoyed them more than the marathon of Obito flashbacks.
I really liked that filler back in the original naruto with the Ramen shop guy trying to get his daughter back. Enjoyable way to learn how they make ramen lol
Filler? Get it out of my face! Hinata filler? I love that! Hinata filler plus her dangerously adorable little sister Hanabi? Yes, yes YES!
super omega hero legendary boss man sounds like the right name
All of the Naruto episode are available on Crunchy no need to go to Youtube
the ovas arent on crunchyroll

Technically his rank is Sage, since he's mastered Sage jutsu.
I normally don't watch fillers, but I gotta do it for Hinata!
And that, guys and gals, is why Hinata is the only one for Naruto, she was the one who will always stand up for him. Kudos, Hinata. :3
Btw, episodes 166 and 167 are the ones this filler is referring to. I couldn't help but watch 'em again, they are some of the best episodes ever, very intense.
I don't normally watch recaps but I gotta do it for Hinata!
i want morrrrrr.......please
Dude. This reminds me of how much of a bitch Sakura was to Naruto at the start of Naruto.
I heart Hanabi! This is the first filler I've watched and enjoyed... EVER!
@Ecchi-Go I just couldn't help but smile at that part. Hinata said she would play with Hanabi & came although she was exhausted. Hinata best Nee-sama.
... @StrangeDreamer - Hanabi is a main character in The Last: Naruto the Movie
This filler and the Kakashi: Shadow of the ANBU arc are the only ones I've enjoyed so far.
Definitely some good filler We've got here.
She doesn't get it. Hair=power. She cut her hair, Hinata grew hers. Of course there'd be a fluctuation in power.
Ok, mind is made. I'm definitely going to start from Episode 1 when the show is over. Maybe even before. The chunin exams were so awesome!
I'm like 99% certain he stopped saying "Believe it!" half way through the Chunin exams. Let's be honest, there was no way dattebayo was going to pass through without some kind of replacement.
I've watched them all over twice in the 12 years I've been watching this show but skipped alot of filler not all but alot. Watching filler once is enough for me.
I think I'm gonna start buying the box sets.... So that I can watch it with the English dub.
Sub has best actors but dub is good to, I know I know every one hates it in english but the dub it one of the few dubs that had good voice's

Now this is what I call good fillers. We learn about characters we only glanced at through the series and learned what makes them tick. This beats those flash back fillers by a long shot. These two episodes actually expanded characters.
I was always annoyed that after Hinata made that big confession to Naruto, they basically ignored her for the rest of the series. Great filler though!
Same here. After that nothing at all was really much said about it between the two.
That sudden urge to rewatch all those old episodes...
I hope Naruto and Hinata becomes an official couple in the upcoming movie: Naruto the Last.
If you've finished the manga, it tells you. It's no secret.
Oi ! Icy Pain spoiler that stuff man ! I want it to happen but where I'm at I can't buy manga. Heck I'm lucky to have internet, that and always being broke doesn't help, and Naruto's licensed so I can't even read it online. Sure others too
Read the manga, Its already ended so itll tell you everything. Im also so excited for the last movie, eep!
Well the movie came out today in Japan. There are probably anime only people there who watched it. Haven't seen a summary from anyone whose seen it yet but I hear Hanabi plays a role and its set before the final chapter of the manga. Sugoi!
I read none of the comments to the OP. Your comment is begging for someone to troll it up and spoil.

YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Any filler isn't so bad when you get more than one at a time :3
Plus, it fits into the show timeline. Fillers that don't are horrid. This is how the fillers should be done!!!
AU fillers like the chikara arc can be good too. If you didn't watch that you should, it was practically a movie.
It was a movie actually XD. At least, it was originally intended to be one.
i hope Naruto chooses Hinata over sakura since she never loved him. Hinata always did.
If there's a filler about the Hyuugas, then it's definitely worth watching.
Next week is where we get started for nothing but action, Madara gets to work

I gotta say Hinata is pretty badass when it comes to her background story
cmon Hanabi you don't need to do a flash back when it just happened five seconds ago.
*cries coz still not over Neji dying*
And where is their mother?
Probably dead, though it would have been nice to have been told one way or another.
Finally, the fillers are over. I do love Hinata themed episodes though...
