who has been waiting on crunchyroll for this to come out
Yeah thats wazzup

To gamecommando: I~! Love you Fairy Tail~<3 x3
The fourth wall must be shattered more! First series over 100 episodes long that i watched from start to current and wanting more... I'm hooked!
Does it come out at a reasonable time on crunchyroll?
Fastest twenty-four minutes of the week.
You need to pay or have a code to see it full ~
For a second I thought it was luffy but it is just markrov
kuroi, Carla's convinced herself that it was just a dream, so she doesn't want to raise any concern by putting it out there until she has legit proof that it wasn't just a dream... She explained this near the end of the first series~~ ^^
At this point, since she "dreamed" about things that she's since actually seen, she has no excuse for not telling anyone.
I sense badassery coming next episode! :-) And am I the only one who cried in happiness yet again at having Fairy Tail back?
I shed some tears of happiness ;-; I'm very delightful that it is back on it's glory.


YAY! I'm not the only one. I cried last week, and cried this week, of sheer happiness as I'm just SO glad it's back. I missed the gang... I missed everything FT so, so much.
Ishida that is actually wrong. If you read the manga you have already seen.
FINALLY AFTER A LONG WEEK FAIRY TAIL IS BACK BABY LET THE GAMES BEGIN!
I rewatched the entire series so, I guess it doesnt feel that distant for me
I've rewatched it twice during the year hiatus and it still feels like i've been waiting for a decade
Who else loves the new opening?!
too bad the full version of the song isnt out
I just started the show a couple months ago, seems it was the perfect time cause I Just missed the hiatus.
That Natsu and Lucy Ship is in FULL sail.
YUS! *Adds Rocket Boosters to it* WE MUST MAKE IT GO FASTEERRRRRRRRRR
okie time for happy's MAX SPEED ATTACK! :3
prefer lisanna
did anyone get goosebumps when makarov said "we're fairy tail" i was like AWWWWWWW SHIIEEEEET

For when you know they're in serious mode!

I never get sick of "Because we're Fairy Tail". Call it corny or whatever but it's apart of FT and all of FT, to me, is magic.
I never get sick of it either. For me it's kind of like the FT version of "Just who the hell do you think we are?!?!" Whenever I hear it I can't help but get all fired up!
got a premium subscription just to watch fairy tail, and i must say it was well worth it
Ya I have yet to regret paying for premium since I joined this site over 2 years ago, I got premium day 1 just so I could stream it over 4g on my phone while I was at AIT for the Army lol
Me too. Fairy Tail was the reason I got a membership so I could watch it in HD. I only wish CR could get the back catalog. All the ads on Hulu are a pain.
It was wise for CR to get the rights to it.
Im in the same boat! Got Premium just for fairy tail 2 years ago and havent regretted 1 bit.
I got CR for Sword Art Online, but kept it thru Log Horizon (both are good, but I think LH is better) and will probably keep CR for FT2. Hell, I think I waste more monthly $s in gasoline waiting at stop lights than CR costs.
Best OP song of the season imo.

Nanananana Hey!
Was kinda wanting more this week, but next week for sure will be epic. And any1 else feel that Laxus and Erza are all FT really need to fight for them to win?
[This comment has been removed]
Mirajane would be really bad news for the opponents also, but think Laxus and Erza will be enough. No point for Makarov to do an overkill.
Grey x Juvia Unison Raid

Gajeel!
FEHAAAARYYYY TAYUUUL
Awesome! Can't wait for more, can't wait for it to get to current manga story
Oh shit, bringing Time Travel into this, Its about to get Paradoxic in here LOL
Don't worry cay, things are about to get awesome.... Yeah.... AWESOMEEEE!
Gotta throw a little Steins;Gate in the mix...
@Tomorroh I agree wish Steins Gate was back on crunchy roll is a really good series.
finally it drives me crazy waiting for a new ep for fairytail :0
The wait is over !! 20 min later the waiting game begins again -_-
I know! I heard the ending music begin and I was so bummed! I swear that was the shortest 20 mins ever!
FINALLY!!!! All this time spent in front of the countdown payed off!
I swear the ending of that OP... I just can't get over it~<3 NATSU X LUCY FTW!!!!!!!! <333
I start squealing when that part comes. xDD
Anyone else miss the old way they animated this Series? :<
Yeah, I think it looks better the way the aminated it last series.
awh yeah!!!!!
"Squishes"...Fairy Tail master confirmed for most badass guild master of the world.
Natsu getting squished by master for the millionth time... priceless lol
Gear 3
This ain't One Piece, yo...but I get the reference!
never gets old ;D
I can't get used to this animation style. They all look less threatening and more childish.
