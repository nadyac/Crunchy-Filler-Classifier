I gotta say, this opening really takes me back. All those years of reading the manga and watching the anime... I feel hollow and complete at the same time, knowing the manga is nearing its end. Thanks Kishi, for creating this epic story.

MarasouUchiha and Lesmoney some of the guest pass codes are still good you just have to look threw them

Madara: "There's about 15 minutes to go." *Checks time remaining on episode* Not saying he wasn't wrong.
Bojangles, you've said what should be said, when people complain about the 5 minutes thing and all. People dun realize how events can happen at the same time and flashbacks lasting for a second, simultaneously with each person thinking it.
Also with the Frieza fight, it is important to remember the Anime was actually ahead of the Manga, so they needed to stall.
You have to remember that the time they use for flashbacks is not counted towards the 15 minutes. We have to assume that it takes seconds for the actual characters to recall their memories but draws it out longer so that the audience can --
-- see what's going on without any confusion.
these will be the longest 15 minutes since Freeza vs Goku battle lol
Summary of episode: Sasuke chops off a branch.
lmfao!!
That was a root.
But it was a really big root. Sasuke gets an A- for effort.
a great root, groot
Why can't we have inspirational leaders like that!?
Make it Udon and we have a deal.
Because, the real world hates people like Hashirama, and Naruto, but I don't, I'd love leaders like them. Or MInato even, cause he's not a failure I know ^^.
I got tingles from the speech
America used to have inspirational leaders like this. Not all of them are necessarily leaders of a country or state, but something. I relate Hashirama's speech to that of Martin Luther King Jr. for example.
Pokenerd, that is the entire world my friend. Where there are people, there are supreme ideals that arise and those with the will to carry them out to the fullest. The only difference is, those with these ideals are faded by human desire
That moment you realize the 3rd Hokage just found out about his son...
Sasuke, still has a jealousy issue's.
what the heck
Sasuke has always had a debilitating case of butt-hurt.
SASUKE NEEDS MOAR HATE
he already has enough hatred within him lol..
Yeah, we should send him to jelly school. I'll get them on the phone right now... "Hello Jelly School..." --- IDK how many people will get this, it's just a South Park reference
looks like Hashirama came up with the 'head-desk' ^_^
Hug and... lick him?!
I am down for a filler episode with more of this.

*after the war* Sasuke: Karen... i'm sorry abou- wait what are you- NO STOP KAREN WTF- AHHHH --> Karen: SASSSSUUUUKEEEEEEE *use imagination*
Every episode just makes me want to cry, since it is nearing the end
@aburden Your kind of a di- a jerk, at least that's the way your msg seemed. And when you compare it to the near 600+ eps we've had to date, we can definitely say its near the end if 20 ep is what you are assuming is left.
I'd be ok with filler if it meant the show wouldn't end
lol anyone else wondering how the manga can finish in just 3 chapters:
lol.. there is so much more still to come.... with fillers this is gonna go on into the new year easily.... and the story is just gonna get better right up till the end...
They don't have much reason to use fillers anymore, since the manga is ending. Fillers only existed to let the manga move along. There shouldn't be anymore fillers, so what is left of the story is all there is.
now i think everyone is concerned with the main question at this point, what actually happened to yamato?
Not spoiling it for you, but that will be answered in time.

Whatever happened to that female ninja that had the curse mark and got trapped by Kabuto (Anko Mitarashi)?
15 mins, so another 10 episodes?
lol in naruto world 3 minutes converts to 20 minutes (remember sakura and chiyo vs sasori)? hahaha
20:12, Kuchiki Byakuya!! Stop crashing other shows, sadly yours has ended
I think that a couple hundred chapters of byakuya being a badass has established he does whatever he wants
Naruto has endured so much pain... It makes my cry to know that even at the end of the world, he is still thinking of everyone else and not himself.
Only 3 more chapters left. I can't deal with this shit.
It's the battle of motivation speeches
"you might get stabbed again" omg i almost died.
It would be funny if he was just in a dungeon somewhere after it's all over just wondering where everyone was at.
ANd Kakashi is stuck in Obito's world, and Sai is sadly shafted by Kishimoto now. But at least we got Team Kakashi: Kakashi, Sai and Yamato, all former/current ANBU team. ^^
You will see Yamato very soon. 5 to 10 more episodes more.
I REALLY REALLY want an episode full of action. This build up is killing me.. THE FLASH BACK FEELS ARE KILLING ME.
I dunno whether I should be happy or sad.. 1. its a good damn episode.. or 2. cos its getting closer to the end!!! HELP ME IN THIS TIME OF CONFUSION!!!!!!
So close to the ending, all the feels
