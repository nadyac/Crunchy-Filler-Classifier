"You can't eat the princess. She's a man!" Elfman will be happy to hear that...
Men!
Meeen!!!
also, ichiya
I don't think Hisui was happy with this plan xP
men!

Moar nude Lucy onegai shimasu!
Yeah, I was so disappointed they skipped some parts. SO MUCH FOR FANSERVICE.
The manga chapter was definitely better. Much more Lucy butt.

manga has more fan service.
Rouge's just like, "The f*uck?"
nope, he doesn't care about the world anymore. Just an evil world dominating bastard.
Kill past rogue = no dragon attack. No dragon attack = Past rogue never needs to be killed. Rogue never killed = dragon attack. Anybody's head feel like a fried egg yet?
Time Travel. Gotta love 'em
What really doesn't make sense is why future rogue tried to kill someone from fairy tail prior to the end of the tournament. He must have known the princess was waiting for proof that he knew the future. He could have thwarted his own plan.
Just goes to show that the people who built that portal where idiots. any plan that requires time travel is doomed to failure because of the fact that you are even planning it. Did no one point this out when they wanted to kill Zeref?
Zirconis well damn that is some powerful magic
Indeed it does what other can't: its take dignity without touching. Now that's some serious skill
IDK ... am I the only one who hopes Z-dragon sticks around? I kind'a like the events that seem to follow Zirconis around.. very Kill la Kill
too bad there isn't a Jade dragon slayer
His powers would have no effect on Gray and Lyon, they would have shown up naked!!!
I think Zirconis and Issei Hyodo are best friends and partners >_>
OMG COBRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Cobra is back and he is still a badass
quick get GI JOE
I really like the random Cobra appearances in here {I'm hoping for that Cobra X Kinana moment I didn't get in the manga, they just alluded to it]
[This comment has been removed]
Cobra for president? Government already full of snakes and vermin!
Well I have a feeling this is going to be an EXTREMELY awkward episode...
I have a feeling next weeks episode is going to EXTREMELY epic! That preview!
im off that day so i'll be able to see it... great!!!! now im getting frustrated lol........
I haven't watched this episode yet but I know the best NaLu moment ever is happening very soon...if not this episodes it should be the next.


Naked beam attack go!!! >.<
Just had to be Wendy to get the one with that power... Any of the guys would be trying to suck in that magic to add to their slayer abilities..
sign me up to become the naked dragon slayer... lol, but in hindsight, a dragon slayer with this ability could probably beat erza easily...
What kind of magic destroys clothing? The best kind of magic!
I Luv Virgo!!! That is all.
She's definately one of my top reasons why I watch Fairy Tail
Is it time for punishment?.....never gets old
"You can't eat the princess! She's a man!" I fell out of my chair laughing at that.
Arcadios face when he saw Lucy XD, Also Not sure if the Princess was thinking, Damn it he was spupppse to see me naked.
Maybe is just me but does the Princess seen to like Arcadios that way ?
No your not alone rofl there was sum *umfff* in that slap xD

I've already made my theory that Lucy and Natsu are gonna get married. I mean it's pretty obvious
Natsu + (naked) Lucy + Church Bells = that's just epic foreshadowing right there!
Happy knows what's up with the ladies.

I gotta learn how to use naked stare >.<
"Move, I'll take the big one". Ah, Laxus being....Laxus.
Haha I knew it! Jellal would come to save Erza. Yiiiiieeee ~ I totally ship them.
Always love em Natsu and Lucy moments!
one of the people in sabertooth the ninja in 4:55 looks kinda like natsu
You found one of those onion chopping goons. Now capture him so he can't chop onions while people are watching anime.
How so?
@D9time your thumbnail fits that comment sooo much
Jenny...did you really think that was going to work? We appreciate the fanservice though.
Would of worked on me!
Agreed
It would of work on me too, sadly it doesn't work on dragons
Jenny's efforts to stop the dragon or intice Cobra through fan service = FAIL
