For someone who can see the future, Touko is the last one to find out these things.
^That's not true, she saw Sachi in the hospital last episode.
Only in flashes. Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
She's probably only seeing things because she keeps looking into the kiln without eye protection... I bet her retina is like fried 0-0...
It is not like she gets to choose what she sees.
well didn't she see the confession in an earlier episode? and she saw her friend crying
I kinda liked the scene where Touko and Kakeru were just laying on the grass together, looking up at the sun through the canopy of the trees. Particularly liked the music that was playing during it.
@jonjoelreece was thinking the same thing. Now I can't wait for Hanamonogatari 2 weeks away.
19:24 is pretty, but I like 11:37 too.
I would like to point out that the correct use is "lying on the grass" not "laying"
yeah the song for that part was great!
what was the songs name?
My respect for Yanagi just shot up for what she did at the end there, takes a lot of courage.

He really did just let her vent, didn't he? She needs to understand that she's not the only one who gets to make decisions about their relationship. Also "lose respect"? Pffft. Allow him to make his mistakes just like you have.
^ I know right, she basically said " I like you, I know you don't like me, if you try to like me then I won't like you anymore". That's like giving up before trying. She showed a lot of guts though.
I agree it takes a massive amount of courage to let someone know that they like them without expecting anything specially when she knows that the guy is into her friend. She earn a lot of points in my book. Best girl so far!
Couldn't she see that it was Okikura's Dad with the lower voice? o-o
Hiro is treating the whole "I'm at Sachi's house" thing as if he's having an affair with her without Touko knowing when he left through the window xD
Doesn't Sachi like Touko? Thats what I got from the episode when they went on the hike.
I ship that relationship so freakin' much... I want Hiro x Sachi pleaaaaaase!
Sachi likes him, but she's keeping him at a distance because she knows her health is iffy. (She knows he feels that way about her because his big sis told her in the car.)
Hiro's big sis tells ALL the secrets. She's a secret-telling machine!
I think Sachi likes Hiro but is afraid of getting with him with her frail health. Unfortunately some people believe that losing something is infinitely more painful than having love someone. I don't agree do ur best with whatever time u hav
Old man compliments a young girl for her growth. Apologizes for awkward comment by bringing her a cookie. Smooth.
i would try that but i don't have enough goddamn cookies
When Kakeru wears his hat walking around makes him seem like a pokemon trainer. LOL!
Gotta catch em all!
FRIENDSHIP PUNCH
CAPTAIN FRIENDSHIP!!!
More FRIENDSHIP PUNCHS next episode considering the title yay
Those aren't going to be friendship punches I don't think.
ROMANCE PUNCH

The music is beautiful. I love this series a whole lot
Those three guys just got TOLD
Yeah, I notice they had no comeback, but I bet they are telling everyone they came up with some clever retort!
Yanagi best girl <3

I love Touko's "EEEEEEEEEEHHHHHH" reaction to everything.

^that one brought back some feels.
God I love Hachikuji...
Try that with Nichijou, that was way crazier
Or - for those with a liver of STEEL: The "Victorique!" drinking game from Gosick. You could die in like half an episode.
I like to think these future visions are just Touko going blind from staring directly into the furnace without eye protection.
"I can see the future!" "No, that's retina scaring."
It's double R. Yes I'm that guy.
"Is a cellphone really that useful?" "I will probably die without it." I'd hate to admit that this is like me. I do everything on my phone these days.
Oh Millennials...what bad habits have we brought into this world?
Don't be ridiculous! Millenials? Dude - I've been waiting my whole life for someone to invent the phones we have now. And the ones that are coming soon enough... I dreamed of an iPod when I was about 6.
I still have no idea what this anime is actually about, other than a bunch of teenagers who have crushes on eachother.
that seems to be it in a nutshell.
Oh, and there's something about seeing the future. But that's not gonna be important later, right?
Finally they spend time together hehehe :s
feeling all tingly inside =]
Yanagi did what anime heroines haven't been able to do for years... *slow clap*
Wait Yukinari is a sprinter!?!?! Why is he doing all those long runs for training if he is a sprinter? Would be better spending his time doing like 80% effort repeats, strength building, and muscle memory exercises to work on form.
And that's why he lost in the trials. It all makes sense.
i think it's because he spent so much time off he has to work on his stamina so the best way to get your stamina up is by extending your distance. after that he can work on regaining muscle mass, stride, and form
The music is strong with this one

Anyone who loves Touko will love that last screenshot. Wallpaper that!
