It's very confusing how this show can be terrible and wonderful at the same time.
I always have hated shows that use ignorant things like this as humor; however, I find this one to be funny.
its exactly like Excel saga totally random and has the wtf factor written all over it you can only watch so many episodes before you need a break lol
PIKA----chu =))
BEST LINE EVER!!
Best episode in the series!
PIKA CHUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Opps, something else came out
something white and sticky
or brown and squishy
That was good
Itadakimasu!
itadakimasu ? wait .. what? I don't even ...
I expected them to say at the end "We're blasting off again!"
lol those 3 are really good at interpreting his random nonsense
i think the only miracle that happened was that they came up with such amazing things from such nonsense!
hey he was giving a track record of legitimate evolution and progress..... granted just on gaming systems, but the base they needed was there.... give the spastic virgin a bit of credit here.
Pika..... CHUUUUUUU!!!
im dying from that ..episode was soooo funny
the artist behind this series is a comedy genius.
"It's no good, something else came out." LOL to dam funny!!
well, I must say I like this theory of the beginning of existence better than most. Is that weird? >.>
Only as weird as this show is weird. ^.^;;
Some people were complaining about Kon in the beginning, but I think he's hilarious. And they chose the perfect voice actor for him.
Couldn't help but giggle the whole episode. Wonder if we'll see this religion in a future episode as well xD
kon-troll xD

I don't understand how this comedy works out, but it is definitely great.
lolz, i love how incredibly flawed Kon is as the "hero"

PIKA......CHU!!!......oh....something else came out XD
Fabulous. Just fabulous.
So stupid yet so funny. Was tempted to drop this after episode 2 but glad I kept watching.
You knew they would go there with "something else came out..."
I can't help feeling I 've been konned int watching this show.............
