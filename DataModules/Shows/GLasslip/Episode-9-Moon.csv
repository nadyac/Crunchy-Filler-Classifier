A manga or something I read recently explained it, and it was like saying the original form of "I love you" in Japanese sounds almost identical to "The moon is pretty," or something along those lines anyway, unless I'm mistaken.

awwww what the friggin poop. hiro doesnt deserve this mahn.
Suki="like" Dai Suki="big-like" Tsuki="moon" Kirei="beautiful". In the episode, Tsuki Kirei "beautiful moon" is another way to say Dai Suki "I love you"
Hm... I interpreted Sacchi's confession as being for both of them.
"He can delete the messages, but he can't delete the love." Raging teenage hormones at its finest.
a true romantic
Sounds a bit like the Highlander quote "they can take our lives but they'll never take our freedom"
^^^ you spelled Braveheart wrong...
omg yes Tyro...Frosty did indeed spell Braveheart a tad wrong lol
I couldn't stop laughing at that corny ass line! Definitely HS teenager material!
The next episode is titled Jonathan. Finally, an episode about the true main character.
Nead mor chiken
Deep fried Jonathan.
@khellrex You monster.
The real crime would be passing up the opportunity to eat delicious chicken
I think Touko's and Hina's mom wanted to wear that dress herself.
I thought all moms steal their kids clothes if they can.
and vice versa...
Main characters aside, is anyone else worried about Momo? Remember when she came out of one of the hospital rooms once, crying? I wanna know what that's about.
I'm still wondering about everything that's going man this show is so confusing
I am SO worried for her!
lol love confession by moonlight to your best female friend who is in all aspect's straight in front of the guy that likes you and has made it abundantly clear... smooth... real smooth...
I freaking love you
Damn, did she seriously invite Hiro just to tell him that she's a lesbo? That's brutal
really tho....touko is a mess, shes all scatter brained with kakeru and sacchan goes and drops the L-bomb on her ass...haha poor girl has too much on her plate. i love the way she freaks out..its so cute
@Zensunni I was just posting that theory. I think she was trying to explain her poor behavior. Confessing how she felt for Touko and then explaining how she felt currently for Hiro. Guess we shall see!
you know she may have just said it to make Touko do her famous huh? eh? whatever that is.
looks like Sacchan a heartless bitch who uses people to get what she wants and enjoys hurting people. I hope people are right and there is more kinder reason why she did this but I don't see it.
At first I thought Sacchi was just pity-dating Hiro, but these days I agree with Zensunni and CagedBird. I think she likes them both.
I know a lot of people that have dropped this anime because it's rather boring. To me, I kept with this (mainly because I'm not one to be super critical of anime and drop a show) because I'm expecting some terrible event to happen soon.
It is slow, but I don't find it boring. I find it interesting, peaceful, and gorgeous.
It isn't boring but it's supernatural with slice of life & regular life is for all intended purposes boring. So if you need Michael Bay go watch transformers otherwise this is a nice change of pace from other animes. Can't reallyfigureitout
It started a bit slow, but got interesting. But this episode drops my rating a bit adding in a yuri element, a little supernatural stuff, but at least keep the rest a normal slice of life.

Contrary to dropping it, when I realized I didn't have time to watch all the anime I initially picked this season, this was the first one I decided to keep. The characters feel real and aren't archetypical.
I'm sure you'll hear the fragments again Kakeru. Probably. Maybe consider what you want to do for the future in the meantime.
I know, right? Graduation's only in six months, after all. Assuming he lives long enough, of course. We mustn't forget about Touko's vision of him falling off a tall building.
The real question is when is one of them going to push David over a cliff or balcony or something. Can't just ignore her future fragment showing him falling.
YOU JUST HELPED ME REALIZE SOMETHING so Sachi conffesed her love to touko in the last few seconds and a few episodes back she tried to stop the "date" between kakeru and tokou so maybe tokou rejects her and sachi tries to kill Kakeru!
That would be a twist I would be alright with as long as she gets those blank yandere eyes going.
Nice boat!
"I get that reference" captain america 2013 and me 2014
The ending confused me :s
MY DREAM MAY COME TRUE, HELLA!!!
There's always been some strong yuri undertones from Sachi and she never seemed able to look at Hiro romantically. Seemed she was preparing him to be let down gently and that last scene was such a beautiful way to come out.
She prepared for that moment for quite awhile as if she knew that it might be her last chance to share her true feelings.She's really making me scared that she's going to leave us..but I don't feel that she knows the results for sure either
Does anyone else think that what Touko sees is actually the opposite of what will happen? Kinda like she is unconsciously confirming her own goodwill, love, or fears by seeing these "fragments"? If so, maybe Sachi is dying...
I love the visuals, but I don't know where this show is really going. Maybe they should all walk around the house naked; feed the chickens or something.
He can delete the email, but he can't delete love!
I feel for Touko. Through no fault of her own she's been put in a position where she has to reject 2 love confessions from friends, not even counting trying to sort out her own feelings for Kakeru. >.<

Seems like it.
So this guy likes you but you don't feel the same way. What do you do? Do you let him down gently? NO. You use him to try to break up your best friend and her 'boyfriend' and then follow that up by confessing to that friend in front of him.
Not to mention use him to explain the confession to your clueless love interest. Did you see that face he made?
i love the scene between Yannagi and Hina
Sacchan is a clever girl.She literally was able to tell both of her friends she loved them without even saying the words.Loved how she used homonyms to bounce her thoughts back and forth 'till her friends realized what she was saying.
After how she used Hiro, I can't really say I like Sacchan... but I do like her style. That was a pretty sweet confession she set up ^_^

Nah she's a douchebag for inviting her boyfriend to her love confession
The fuck is going on now? Q.Q
I understand less now than I did in the previous episode, even. This show is a train wreck, but I still can't stop...curse my optimistic hope!
