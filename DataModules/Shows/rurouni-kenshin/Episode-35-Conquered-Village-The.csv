That's some imagination you have Saito.
Saito is now my fav character from now on due to his marvelous imagination.
Try reading the manga. He's a lot funnier then in the series.
Wow. I still love this.
OMG things escalated so quick!! But no way the final fight with Shishio come so early, what will happen now??

Nice cone head...and is that little Sojiro person working for Shishio a girl or a boy?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okita_S%C5%8Dji He was real, captain of first unit of Shinsengumi. One of the best swordsmen of that era, a master at 18, hes usually portrayed as boyish and overly happy, but sadistic. Guessing before wiki pic
Sojiro is a boy I don't think it's the same Sojiro Okita of the Shinsengumi. He dies at the end of the Bakamatsu. (In the OVA)
Realized this later when it shows him and Saito in Shinsengumi gear. Tipsyyy you are correct. Its fun to read up on people these chars are based on though. Here's Kenshin. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawakami_Gensai - not expecting that!

Hijikata was mentione but I've no idea if he's alive or dead.
Lmao that thought cloud was 2 funny
