I wold like to see another season. this show was very deep. It leaves a strong impression on people. there are a lot of life leasons in it.
checked if there was a real Hell Link and turns out there is one O__O though it still works when it's not midnight, there's NO way i'm entering a name in
I tried it, but it doesn't really happen. The person you have a grudge against does not go to hell, you do not get a straw doll, you don't meet hell girl, & you don't get a mark on your chest claiming that you're going to Hell.
lol fan made up site.
I remember a site where you can actually only access to it at midnight, at 12:01 it didn't work. Couldn't find that site ever again after some years. :/
^ I remember that sight...I...was terrified when I found that.
The series really redeemed itself here. The ending was ludicrously fitting, and anybody who says otherwise really doesn't understand that this isn't a happy show. Just as she did with Takuma, Ai was willing to sacrifice herself for Yuzuki.
In the end, Enma Ai is a sacrifice again...she was destined to be the moment she was sacrificed in the village, and her existence as Jigoku Shoujo makes her an eternal sacrifice for all those who could've taken her place...so beautiful

This episode just inspired a ton of yuri hentai across the internet...

Like many of you, I'm hoping for a fourth season as well.
wahh.. i am so happy Ai-san is back.. She is the most fitted Hell Girl in my opinion.. No one else can ever replace her place.. BTW, i didn't know Ai-san had a boyfriend.. i wanna see her and her bf together.. (>^<)
you know that boyfriend they were talking about? that was me! <3 :3
Yeah, watch season 1 and you'll know why they can't be together...

That wasn't her boyfriend, that was her cousin, and he betrayed her. She hates him, violently, but learned to move on in Season 1. I ultimately believe that Ai loved Yuzuki in the end, what with all the kissing and the heartfelt goodbye.
I think she loved her too. I think she was inspired by Yuzuki's determination to stop the bad and look for the good.
I cry every time I watch this. Enma Ai can cool your heart, like the highest quality fruit ice cream. That soothing feeling as you swallow it is so great!
this episode almost made me cry, remember you can't spell aishiteru without Ai.
That's a good point about having rights to judge other people. You don't.
One of the few anime I rewatch constantly. It has it all, beautiful art, music, and stories, its so bitter sweet! It is just so hauntingly beautiful, I just love Ai, can relate to her, feel for her and just love the music so much.
When Ai says "care to give death a try?" it sends a shiver down my spine. But when Yuzuki says it.... eh....
Damn I waited and waited for them to reveal how Ai came back, but they didnt. I am so mad now. Season 3 feels like they just extended it for the sake of extending it, yet the last few eps were so good I wont sent the producers to hell ;p
When the hell gate opened

That was a good ending. Very fitting to the show
i really hope Ai doesn't have to spend eternity being hell girl. if there's a fourth season i hope she finally becomes free of her duties.
I think the fact that she finds peace with meeting Yuzuki actually makes her role acceptable for her. Before, she was always repressing her emotions,
Now that she has peace she can do this job happily. I mean, internally she's found peace, and she has a family (her companions) and friends as well.. so after all why not become a force of nature for eternity? No need for retirement~
It sucks that Ai has to be Hell girl for eternity.. I've been rooting for her to get rid of her job as Hell girl too! D:

I also feel the same way, but did you see the way Yuzuki acted? She was too naive and bitter, she let her emotions get in the way and like the king of hell said, "Hell Girl has no need for a heart."
It was her first day on the job. They didn't even give her a proper orientation, or training.
I doubt Ai ever got "proper orientation, or training." Or maybe that's just me, just saying. XD
I love this show hell girl is just sick no remorse for the innocents while yuzuki fights to keep hers I love for another season to come out
