@epicurianddreams Would be amazing if they invented an AC that turned on automatically once it sensed your body temperature going up And then when it senses your body temp going down to a "cold state", it turns off
That bowl of water in Kirigaya's sink got more screen time than Klein...
That balloon definitely had some kind of meaning behind it. It may only have been a simple shape moving in almost a straight line, but animating takes time and effort. So if something is animated, it is there for some kind of effect.
it means he wasnt far from asada nd y does he get all the bitches
that balloon is more involved in the story than Asuna is
Klein trying to steal kiritos harem...

Lol the 5:30 pizza. I almost forgot about that.

@Wolv now when did that happen later on he trys to it on some random npc to kind of weird.
thay did not play him of as gay in the books or the manga ... or did thay ill need to reread thows ....
Aw come on Sword Art. When are you gonna tell us the detail on what happened to Klein's 5:30 pizza from season 1 episode 1?
Turns out the pizza guy was an SAO player too
Thats horrible
lololololol y is this sooo funny
man bear pig... really not illegal in most states... dumb. its illegal in prolly just about every state, that u can not enter someones home without persmission which is why states have the law where if someones does do that they can be shot
I'd LOVE if they made a reference to this later in the anime
"Sorry, I spaced out in a middle of the fight..." Don't you hate lag when you're in a middle of a team fight?
I bet Asuna was hanging out with Klein too much that he showed Asuna how to lag like he did in SAO XD
F#ckin' LAG!! AGHHHH!!
@L33TK1T3 MMO's are home to some of the most hardcore players you will ever meet. Keep your flawed prejudice to yourself. MOBA's are not the only form of gaming out there that matters.
She was AFK. It wasn't lag.
SAAAACCCHHHIIIIIII!!!!!!!- kirito: sword art abridged
Dejavu to Season 2 and the cousin's stalker/friend. He doesn't stand a chance against the Kirito-trap.
I know, I saw the trademark logo, and I bout fell out of my chair... nice placement
You, my good sir, is the reason why i like reading comments
Shinkawa coming on way too strong
he's a yandere isn't he?
Every fiber in Shinkawa's bones tell me this soft-speaking man/boy is weird & shady. I'd never trust a guy who wears a hat in smaller size than his own head.
Shinkawa-kun acts like a stalker/ closet perv EVERY time he is with Shino-chan....... other than the first time we meet him.....
Shinkawa-Kun acts like a closet perv/ stalker around Shino-chan I have issues with this don't be taking Kirito's new harem member.... or else you'll get kneed in the face
shinkawa-kun has that pervert/ stalker hairstyle down pat though
Suguha could "feel" Kirito leave her friends list? The incest is strong with this one.
there seems to be a HUGE purple haze around this topic!!!!!!
What's wrong with some of you people? Just no....
It's not incest when their cousins -_-
>. <
i couldn't stop laughing after reading that comment xD
The adult in me appreciates the dramatic side and enjoys the drama and character development... but the child in me wants more of Kirito kicking ass.
that's just the SAO way
THE FEELS BRO! Kirito just makes me want to open up and confess things. bahaha



Nurse: 'This is you chance to get free counseling from a hot nurse.' Lmao, well she gave more than just counseling there.
I dont think it would have been as impactful coming from Asuna or any one else from SAO. Mainly because they were also involved in the situation. The nurse was a third party perspective as well as an older and experience with death choices
Damn, I'd be in love with that nurse after the first & second hug. xD
I'm so glad Kirito opened up to her. I was gonna be upset if he didn't talk to anyone. That turmoil was eating away at him. It's amazing how just talking can lift the weight off your shoulders and make it easier to breathe.
Aw, you feel bad about having killed people? Come motorboat in Nurse Joy's boobies. Hope to see you again!
I can only imagine what the nurse does to kirito's body everytime he enters ggo
That balloon was the MC in this episode
Shinkawa is mad jealous because all Sinon thinks and talks about is Kirito HAHA
This anime has always shown people's strong will through their fighting spirit. Just as Kirito's will to live allowed him to fight his way out of Sword Art Online, Shinkawa is now desperately fighting his way out of the Friend Zone.
If Shinkawa is deathgun I will be so disgusted wit SAO that I will never watch another episode, light sabers or no. Does every Otaku yearn that badly for a harem? Can no one take girls likeing anyone but them/ the main character?
@stardude692001: Psychological study actual relationship chart: img.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/tdomf/7 show side chars finding new love, others don't. Neither are important.
why would the guy who convinced Kirigaya to go investigate GGO allow him to keep the name Kirito. Since the villians either from SAO or just new ones would have known of this super beater Kirito-the guy who beat SAO. Death Gun knows of him.
I get a sad feeling shinkawa dies.
@ani-mae75 why wouldn't he? He wanted Kirito to make an impression of being strong so that he would be targeted and they could quickly find Death Gun, his name has already drawn him out once.
Shinkawa, one does not simply beat Kirito in a fight, sorry.
Sinon and Kirito got it wrong, the tournament isn't today... It's next week!

Hey closed. Congrats on learning a new word. It's better to learn it on crunchyroll than the morning after a bender in Bangkok.
I wish I could see their reactions, but the show might not touch on it.
In the LN, Kirito did state that when he was younger he was often mistaken for his cousin's sister, so yes, he does look a little girly.
@Mariox777 I don't think intentionally trying has anything to do with it. If it looks like a girl, but you flirt with it and you find out its a guy, IT'S A TRAPP!!! Traps like Megumu from If Her Flag Breaks that don't like being seen girl
This episode was such a tease lol
Plot Twist: The balloon is death gun.
I LAUGHED WAY TOO HARD AT THIS THAN I SHOULD HAVE AAHAHAHAHA
Directed by M. Night Shyamalamadingdong.


Yeah, the next arc, which will I'm hoping will be animated, is all about our favorite heroine. For now, we just have to enjoy Sinon's badass-ness XD. And Kirito's since he's kind of like a "heroin" this season, lol!
[This comment has been removed]
Lol. You know heroin is a drug and heroine is a female hero, right?
LOL!!!!
I wish we could see Asuna fight like she did in SAO

She re-rolled a healer, nbd
Oh, I so hope they do the Excalibur arc and then Mother's Rosario. And to Ero-Senpai, (slight LN spoiler, but you should know this already) she might be a healer, but she can still kick ass with a Rapier. She has 2 years of sharpened skill.
ha, "sharpened"
It's really hard to look bad ass in capris and a collar :/
I thank you for this comment.
Bet they were the only ones that came in black.
Sorry to tell you Shinkawa but I think Sinon wants Kirito...

Sinon is in Kirito's harem already, and she hasn't even noticed it.
Wow. After really thinking about it.... I have the strange feeling the Shinkawa/DeathGun Theory has some cred. That makes things really personal especially with the Sinon/Kirito development, though I still hope D.G. is a different person
Death Gun is a former laughing coffin player who surprisingly enough survived SAO. I really doubt is shinkawa. I think is an older person
Plus, Shinkawa WAS in the main room watching the match when Darth Gun surprised Kirito Skywalker with his "Are you the real thing?" question.
