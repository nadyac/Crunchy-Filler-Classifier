I know, right? She's always yelling his name at inconvenient times.
probably one of the most annoying characters ive seen in any anime. I skip past any part that shes in, usually its just moping of fawining over Ken.

@Eclipse897 you must have skipped most of the anime then. Sucks for you.
Those 300 years were totally worth it. Damn those violent christians hurting Kenshin. Kenshin is way more peaceful than them.
Would have liked to see this guy versus Shishio.

not a spoiler >.>... and he won't

i do want to skip Karou's part but i don't want to miss any part of the anime. So damn annoying, why do most anime female characters end up as a burden
