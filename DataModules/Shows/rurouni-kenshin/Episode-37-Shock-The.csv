Don't you just love it when the title of the episode is a spoiler? lol
This weasel girl just doesn't shut up... =_="
Her voice actor in the english dub made it even worse. I thank crunchyroll its in japanese.
she is so annoying...and why no one ever listens to Kenshin???
It's no wonder they didn't take weasel girl along...
Saito has waifu? much plot twist. such shock. wow.
Saito could have fought Soujiro instead of Kenshin so that Shishio wouldn't get away. Or if Soujiro didn't allow Kenshin to go, then Saito could have gone after Shishio. But staying just in case Kenshin loses or needs help was better.
And Saito said neither wanted to go after Shishio cuz they couldn't read Sojiro and didn't know how he'd react if one of them snuck off :p
This girl is SO annoying! She kinda of reminds me of Nami... her annoyance and her love for money. #selfish
When they were standing on top of the hill at the end... all I saw was Kenshin, Kaoru, Sanosuke, and Yahiko version 2.
I thought Sojiro was a girl this whole time! Aw, I was excited for a strong female character....
Shut up already Eiji go home and get lost.
Kenshin doesn't really like Misao.. Hmmmm.
