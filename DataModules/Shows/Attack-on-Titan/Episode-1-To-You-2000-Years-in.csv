let them fight
To the people watching this for the first time, you made a mistake waiting this long...
haha yeah I just started it now and damb what was I missing....
Look at 15:40. Mikasa looks so creepy! :0
Waited too long?... Second season isnt till like 2016 nothing is going anywhere lol...I should have actually waited to watch this, not in 2013..
(stops eating tuna sandwich)....(continues eating sandwich)
be sure to cut your tuna sandwich in half before eating it. anything less would be uncivilized.
lol exactly! we don't want to look like savages now do we?
"Scoff" you hooligan cut that damned sammich!!


I don't know... he led the titan right to their mother. If he'd fought or tried to help dig her out, they all may have survived.

Okay. I had to quit watching this at the end because i was literally screaming at the screen, "HANNES YOU STUPID FUCKNUGGET DONT TRY TO BE MACHO DIG HER OUT AND CARRY HER AND RUN AWAY AAAAAHHHHH!!! and my parents were like what the hell

It's the smile of those things. That's what gets me.
I concur, that's the scariest part of this anime.
That last scene killed me a little on the inside.
I decided to watch this again and it still gives me the shivers
Incredible. This show taps into the primal fear of losing our place on the food chain in such an effective way. A simple idea with the right execution can transcend any number of gimmicks. Here's hoping the quality holds up throughout.

Hatchumo - What makes this anime unique is its take on human emotion. The fear, anger and helplessness that the characters experience are interesting in addition to the action.. The enemies just happen to be giants and are beside the point.
I find it really creepy how the titans look human. Some looks happy and they are eating helpless people and some titans like the one that ate Eren's mum have the creepiest expressions ever.

THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is how you start an anime series
I KNOW RIGHT???!!! So many animes are boring in the beginning, but with this anime you jump right into the action.
Yeah, I honestly don't remember the last time I spent the last few minutes of a show's opener with my hand up to my face, jaw dropped. Anime or otherwise.
"Do we start it with an amazing opening? Or scarring the main character for life?" correct answer? BOTH
This left me disturbed. Not happy. Not sad. Just deeply, deeply disturbed.
I'm re-watching it now. That is the overall tone of this entire show. XD
talking about gadgets makes me think of BATMAN...he would never lose
My goodness that end is horrifying! It disturbed me, but for some reason I am laughing. How wrong is that? Dang there should be a warning up or something.

"I'm Batman." Oh, I can see it now...


A man's card cannot be revoked, if he cries for another. This is the essence, of Manly Tears!
i haven't cried since clannads.....this brought the hurt....

... Am I some kind of monster then? Or am I just not manly enough to produce this man water? I only felt shocked at how much blood there was and how it splattered EVERYWHERE and how scary the Titan looked with it's creepy smiley face.

I bet it killed her too.
PREPARE FOR BEST ANIME 2013
you can modify your account for anime only and pay less, if I want the drama, I'll go back to huluplus
Be prepared for the darkest anime of 2013
^ True dat
Still one of the best tho
@AnimeVocaloidGirl I think you have it right. Either way, I'm hooked at episode 1.
I don't think its China, I always thought it was Germany based on the names of the characters and the geography.
@Morihuas They were saying it was analogue to a province in China called Qinghai aka it was similar to the size of Qinghai, not that it was set in China.
how the hell did they build a wall that big while trying to escape from titans??
bob the builder????
I read somewhere before that the walls were built BEFORE the titans came 100 years ago...really makes me wonder...

Need some brutality in your life? CR has just the Anime for you!
you called

It's very dark. I'm looking forward to this little jewel. = )
right up there in bleakness and gore with Berserk. And that's saying a lot.
agreed intense
It had like 10 million views and then it was taken down
Darkest anime I've seen to date. Terrifying, depressing, but the action is what makes up for it.

With crunchyroll quality, the action and terror scenes look even more intense. This is my 3rd time watching episode 1, and it still sends shivers down my spine.
I've watched this episode a few times myself and I still goosebumps every time I watch it.
seriously, i cry every time.
The flaming logo at the beginning made me wonder who's cuisine would reign supreme.
The art is astounding. The plot is thick. The appeal to your humanity is sickening and stomach churning. I can't wait for more.
The art is thick. The plot is astounding.* FTFY
YES! So happy to see amazing action movies coming out! So tired of the Moe, and Ecchi Harems lol Best anime ever made are action, its about time they make a comeback!
you got that right.
IKR! I'vve been waiting for there too be more action animes to come out.
hmmm a titan ecchi moe harem.... (pictures it) ARAGH MY EYES!
Well, there is that moe titan in Episode 5... it's featured in the Titan Middle School manga spinoff, too.
This show is disturbing in a good way.
