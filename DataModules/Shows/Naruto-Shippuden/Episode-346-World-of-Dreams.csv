this isnt a filler not only is this in the manga this has everything to do with the main storyline this is relevant and useful information
I like it when there's deep histories, and expositions of character's past lives. It helps to fill in the gaps of so many unanswered questions.

No festy, a filler is something that is is not in the manga... A "filler" in a manga(basically a pointless chapter) would just be a bad unrelvant chapter.
Too many people say "its filler," I just watch everything even if it is filler...you can still learn stuff about the characters in filler which is why I think watching every little bit is important.
Who cares if it's a filler. This is a good episode so just watch it!
I think the first half of this episode is important especially with everything that is currently happening in the manga. Yahiko is so cute! Why did he have to die
Love letter part was super cute, Yahiko is so awkwardly awesome
I lol'd at it! xD I always see Yahiko as the leader of the Six Paths of Pain with the super scary Rinnegan, but seeing him screw up speeches and react to the love letter was just priceless xD
The Akatsuki could have been such a great group. It seems like a majority of all the sad things in this were caused by Danzo
Gawd here I am at 5am its like I'm a dedicated 10 year old
@Cpt-Obvious Truth!
lol i remember waiting up all night to watch this when i was 10 this show was my childhood
@corelace If you waited for the is show at 10, you are still in your childhood Enjoy it !

Everyone who calls this filler has no real concept on what naruto want's to do.

Zachary765 is right. I don't mind fillers.
People seem to want to label every episode that contains flashbacks or sidestories that they're not interested in as "fillers"... regardless of whether they were in the manga or if they contain useful and relevant information.
I think the point is, that when Naruto episodes are canon, they're really good.
llcoolnik. Filler are made to make time for the manga and not catch up with it. They can be put as part of the story on the anime but they're never part of a canon on the manga. So, you have no idea what fillers are. This is half filler.
For the longest time, I always wanted to know how Rin died. It was such a huge part of shaping Kakashi into who he was. I had no idea, now that we finally know, what a huge part it had in shaping Obito, and thus the world itself. Tragic.
Nagato the third wheel.
It's amazing how such a pure idea can become so corrupt.
a lot of it has to do with danzo.. he screwed them. and then obito's influence was another major factor
Did you see Yahiko's face when he saw the love letter. Hilarious!!!
I can't believe that the Akatsuki was a peacefull group
It's interesting to see that they were technically rogue ninja from the start however, yet of a very different sort.
Like the U.N
More like Celestial Being, just less organized.
No brad, the U.N. is like the foundation with Danzo.
well "bringing about peace" is usually code speak for lots and lots of slaughter. if someone wants to go as far as to create a completely peaceful world, then they usually mean destroying the world completely
So weird how the Akatsuki was based off of a really peaceful idea.
ya, i feel the same. A team, created out of peaceful ideals, known currently as a hateful endgame organization.
Well they were taught by Jiraiya
damn danzo/obito
Peace through suppression, how many terrible countries have tried that one? And how many idealists have brought them about through good intentions?
so that's how nagato got his eyes
I thought he got his eyes from staying up all night fapping to Konan...
two episodes one day..it must be my birthday
is it now?
It is actually my birthday lol, nice present ! :3

I actually really enjoy this episode. No wonder it was actually Madara's eye Rin. Whole thime I thought it was actually Nagato's eye.
when tobi was posing as madara and fights konan he say that those eyes were his to begin with meaning they were madaras to begin with
@Corelace. Exactly, I thought Tobi was just lying and trying to steal Nagato's eyes but now it all makes sense.
if you didnt like this episode then you are not a true fan of this series. great way to fill in holes in the manga. the next one should be epic!!!!
Plot twist: Rin rejects obito in the prefect genjutsu world
Madara" have Pain resurrect her using his Rin Tensei? That way he gets Rin back, no one has to die, and the ultimate evil doesn't have to start a war with the entire shinobi world.
I seem to remember at some point that Konan pointed out to Obito that he had really been riding on Yahiko's coattails all along. Obito countered that Madara had been guiding everything. Now, I think I agree with Konan. Obito is all mimicry.
