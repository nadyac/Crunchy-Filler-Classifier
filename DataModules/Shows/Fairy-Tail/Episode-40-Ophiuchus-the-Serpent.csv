Rofl "raging demigod jackass" I love you Happy!
Happy's been getting some pretty good lines lately, eh? lol
Aye!
Aye sir!
Sweet opening!!!!!! Also, this fan service is getting kinda out of and in this arc. O.o
Agreed, the fanservice was unnecessary, even in Fairy Tail standards.
Horny illustrators xD
dunno what fan service you're talking about, watched it all and seen no such thing? Unless your talking about when Virgo kicks Lucy off of her, I wouldn't necessarily call that detailed fan service however. . . Not compared to other anime.
Fan service or not, you can't spell Illustration without "lust" @u@
Yeah ... I have to warn you (well anyone yet to reach this point) the fanservice is going to get even more intense when it gets back to adapting the manga ...
Sweet OP, hopefully that means this arc is coming to an end soon.
actually, it looks like this could continue for a bit, since the end theme still features the rouge celestial spirits
Apparently there's 3 more episodes of this filler arc, followed by some omake chapters in February. Soon after that we should be back to main canon because the current arc is ending in the manga this month.
Basically it goes like this: January will be the end of the this filler arc, February will be the omake episodes, March will get back into the plotline
No march is going to be the light novel and then april we'll get back to canon.
Ya this arc is getting a bit old. Also what a plot twist... I would have never guessed it was the King's fault. I thought that he was subdued by the 12 spirits.
I'm going to steal a page from George Takei and say, "Oh, Myyy!" about the ladies in th OP scene.
I couldn't help but laugh at what Wendy was wearing though hahahaha
the dudes look so badass as well i mean removing happy lol
They could have given her something cute to wear
I m always confused when people rant against the in-between arcs. I like all of the arcs; though the jiggly butt clan should be forgotten.
Hahahahaha My buddy has a picture of the leader from the jiggle butt bandits as his Facebook Cover page. No joke.

Not going to lie, the girls from FT in the new OP song is quite something.
They are looking pretty fine. That's for sure.
This is all a bad dream. Hopefully we wake up soon!

Not just the animation, the sound didn't help either. Seriously, compared to the epicness of the previous times it was used, this was pathetic.
bring back loke =(

After this arc ends, let's all agree to pretend it never happened.
Someone should get to editing the wiki page for Fairy Tail by erasing any and all trace that this ever happened. The only highlight was Lucy and Yukino pulling off their Urano Metria
@WisteriaBlossom: That was not a highlight. They absolutely desecrated the epicness of that spell this episode.
Amen. never mind explaining where Yukino learned it. Please, can we have the original animation teams back? These guys are...well...childish is a good word. The lack of detail is saddening (I also miss the CG magic circles)
And the fights were dumb especially the game show...uhh...let's get back on track with what FT is all about. I guess Lucy needed some action but seriously ;(
Can't agree more. I want the original animation team back. It's not the same, even the humour comes across poorly with this team half the time. Still love and will continue to watch.
Ophiuchus, you're such a snake.
I SEE YOU EVERYWHERE XD

Finally! I caught up to Fairy Tail. <3
;-;... Recommend any animes I should watch while I wait?
@ruyh87 ummm well naruto and one piece are really good and if you want some cute say 26 episode animes, ouran high host club and fruits basket are soooo cute and really funny!! hope this helped!!
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is godly. Don't get thrown off by it having a kid for a protagonist, it's REALLY good. Although, you'll probably be waiting until the day you die to see the actual ending, knowing it's author.
Wow do I miss my time with Hunter X Hunter on Tuesday's
Akatsuki no Yona is an excellent series. Sound, animation, scoring, all of it are top notch
Love both the new opening and the ending!
omelet.. mackerel.. tempura... damn, that makes me hungry.
One thing about Happy his character stays consistent either he is a smart ass, cracks jokes, save's natsu or is hopeless. Is there anything that I missed...LOL

I think "raging, demigod jackass" is my new favorite insult. And the fact that Happy says it makes it even better.
That new ed song I am a fan
