By far one of the most satisfying episodes in a really long time.
So many great moments in this episode... too many to count!
just wanna state i havent watch the episode yet but this comment is getting me SUPER excited!!!!! GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH


HASHIRAMAAA!!


Wth sit down Sasuke, you were never suppose to want to be hokage
lol! I know! The best reaction eva! haha just like when they were kids Annnd.. for now he's being a good boy for the chance to play again with his friend... hmm but Sasuke looks just like his brother, but he hasn't noticed yet has he?
The writer's dragged on with that "friendship/comrade" nonsense for so long that I completely forgot that the hokages were on the way. When they showed up I had forgotten all about them; it was unexpected and totally awesome.
How come we get to see what was under Tobi's mask before we see Kakashi's face?
I laughed so hard when Hashirama destroyed Madara's buzz. XD

666 likes u are the real madara
y madara could wait? if they're gonna seal the 10 tail away would the project tsuki no me able to work?madara could just control 10 tails or attack the troops at once leaving them no chance to catch 10 tails. Villains in Naruto are too soft
it's like "wait ! times out ! I'll deal with 10 tails first! " - Hashirama . When Madara (if he cares about the project tsuki no me to work) would just attack full force that instant.
Madara said he no longer had control of the ten tails.... pay attention pls.
Your going to be Hokage, Im going to be Hokage, We're all going to be Hokage!

Oprah NEEDS to make a cameo on Naruto. =O She can be a nations Hokage! Oprah Sama! Nani? It has such a lovely ring to it *o* , and her powers will be tv hosting and car giving. She can call on celebrities with her summoning jutsu
HOKAGE FOR EVERYONE!
Was waiting for Madara to say he changed his mind and wants to be Hokage now...... why the hell not everyone else is doing it. Wait, maybe I want to be Hokage.......
A hokage village
by far one of the best eps worth waiting for
I guess even this episode can't contain all the Hokage at the same time.
So true. I was sweating in excitement
lmao he shut him with a quickness, roasted him lol
The only one missing is the current one.
Don't forget, Danzo was a hokage also.
Danzo's face isn't craved in the village, so he doesn't count.
IVE LITERALLY BEEN WAITING TO HEAR "TEAM 7 IS BACK TOGETHER" SINCE I WAS 15 AND IM 21 NOW
Been a while since i smiled that much in a naruto episode
I am crying for some reason. Are these tears of join for my old friends finally reuniting or is this tears of sadness knowing that the end is near.

I hope Cruncyroll gives me an achievement for the amount of times I've refreshed the page...
You're not the only one. I don't know how much longer I can take this before I cancel my subscription.
Shows takes a little while to process after the initial release sometimes. If you can't watch it in the first 5 minutes just wait like 5 more and there is generally no problem at all. Calm your fucking tits.
Well, the way to deal with so much streaming at once is to pause the video, either before it starts or once it hits its first lag spike. Then, just let it sit there while it buffers ahead so you can watch the rest more coherently.
I remember reading some time ago that Crunchyroll only buffers ahead by 2 minutes.
Its really annoying
But..but.. SAI
He's chilling with Yamato somewhere we don't know about.
Flying around on ink birds.
He's going to show up soon ;-)
maybe they developed some knew power
I want to know what happened to Anko. She seems to be forgotten.
Akamaru for Hokage!
It would be very true to the very nature of the show for Akamaru to be revealed as the next Hokage before Naruto is. lol
Well Danzo is officially the 6th Hokage. Although, we'd like to pretend that didn't happen.
@scorpeon17 Danzo still needed to be accepted by the Jonin to be officially confirmed as the 6th Hokage; he was just a 6th Hokage Candidate.
is this going to be the last naruto season or are thy going ot make more seasons omeone answ e please ieing to know.
Even if this is the last season (which it won't be) we still have well over 50 episodes more to go so yeah.

Its the equivalent of Snowden returning and beginning his campaign for president (minor differences like he didn't previously declare intent to destroy the land but he's a famous missing fugitive).
@sygtnok it isn't really a change of heart as it is a change of tactics. notice his lack of care for everyone's opinion? he is just going to take it into his own hands n fix things, is his mindset.he's still behind the ball on
@sygtnok, I understand your pint of view. Although if you think about it Sasuke has been lied to all of his life (by friends,family and those he trusted), and only recently been showed the truth.....
...So it's understandable that he would want revenge against the source of his (personal), and his clans plight. And in following from his blood-line seeks ruling and domination to correct what he perceives to be wrong.
leaveitallhall: Yeah, I call bullshit on that. There are plenty around Naruto who cared more for him and did more for him than Sasuke ever did. He's only obsessed with Sasuke because of stupid, contrived plot reasons.
I forgot to breathe this whole episode... I think I died. Jiraiya says,"I taught Minato to always make a flashy entrance. Plus that Sakura looking might fine."

(as somone who doesnt read manga) NOW THAT would be a plot twist and a half and id instantly vote somone ressurects Chiyo via temp ressurection, and then she teaches somone to ressurect itachi...
Now THAT would be the best troll ever haha!
OR!.... or, if kid naruto just finally wakes up from being passed out on the toilet from drinking that bad milk so long ago.
@Fried_Twinky mind F-ing blown
I never thought i would be emotional, but I can't stop crying. For those that have invested years into watching this show, episodes like these are the reasons it makes all that time worthwhile.
I know, I have been waiting years to see this in the show. Reading it in the manga just doesn't compare.


anyone else got a huge kick in the nuts when naruto replied to minato saying " yea she basically is !!!" i mean fuck did you not remember what just happed with you and hinata !?
Because Kishimoto is a robot who doesn't understand how human emotions work? That's the only plausible explanation I could come up with.

White Screen no Jutsu!
Really lol. Loved it
