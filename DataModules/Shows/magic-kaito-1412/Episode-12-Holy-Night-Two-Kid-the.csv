Woah, was that a Nakamori x Kid flag?!!! jk
Yes, I think it was... I wonder if more flags will be raised? :p
The audacity of that Kid... putting the star right in front of Detective Nakamori xD
nah... it couldn't be... me: dying laughing

Inspector Nakamori has quite the Kid obsession.
Thank God CR got this. No more delaycasts. Happy New Years!
That weekly manga comment doe... The fourth wall has almost been broken
The joke is that while Magic Kaito does appear in Shounen Sunday, it is far, far from weekly. More like every few years Gosho decides that he wants to write a bit more Kid without Conan getting involved.
ahhh, wheres the end of the episode?
It's a little odd to see that kind of "misunderstanding" animated when they're decorating the tree in what is basically a kids' show.
A lot of kids shows have adult references, and many jokes that only adults would get. Go rewatch some shows you did as a kid. You'll be surprised what you missed.
WTF is it me or did it cut out before the episode was even finished?????
yeah over 6 minutes is missing
This is where the part this is the derp eps recording.
No It Couldn't be The Giant Star Worth 10,000,000 Yen
Well we know that his magic is just preparation, but to make those preparations so quickly is magic itself!
Speaking of disappearances, whatever happened to Hakuba? lol
I was just wondering the same thing. xD
I think he dies at some point in the Conan side of things.

i know...
I see Detective Nakamori likes them hard to get...
They fixed it to show the ending... and come on! How can no one think that was not dumb of the cop not to notice that not on the tree?
...it clipped the ending....it clipped the fucking ending aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh
So the detective thinks of him like that huh...
rofl. nakamori keibu .. jeez..

16:40 So KFC is "gourmet food" now?
In Japan, KFC is often eaten for Christmas. Also, they dress Colonel Sanders up as Santa. It's neat!
