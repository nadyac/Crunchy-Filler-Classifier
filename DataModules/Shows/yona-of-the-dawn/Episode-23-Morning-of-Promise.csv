I'll be deeply disappointed if Su-Won repents, she forgives him & everything is rosy (happily ever after etc). I want Vengeance!! Cruel, calm VENGEANCE!! And I want Hak to sit there chortling while Yona exacts that vengeance!!
i want yona to end up with Hak ><
@katt14 That's sexy.
I don't think Su Won is even a bad guy. He's only the antagonist in the sense that he is acting against Yona, and even then the only thing he's done, not to downplay the significance of it, is kill her father, who wasn't really a good king.
He wasn't the best king, but he kept peace throughout his reign. I want to know if he really killed his brother. It makes the whole Su-Won killing the king as more than just an act of vengeance.
Hak's Yona-sense is tingling
"Her brilliance consumes me..." Me too, Jeaha, me too.
At this rate, I really hope the show gets a second season. There's no way to wrap this up in one episode and the manga has quite a bit to adapt. Make it happen Pierrot
It's easy to find episode counts for a lot of shows with sites like MyAnimeList. It's gonna be 24 episodes for season one. Hopefully a season 2 is announced for the future.
PLEASE! I want more...
There's gotta be a second season - Jeaha has only just joined up & the 4th Dragon appears to be introducing himself in the next ep! How can they have a satisfying conclusion with that in only one more ep?! Pleeease dont ruin this!!
Yea, i mean they have to make it tie back to the beginning, like they did in the manga
I know!! The manga is already soo far!!! Season 2 pleaseeee!
After seeing this nice sunset scene with Yona and Hak they better end up together or I'm going to cut somebody.
I'll be right there with you. As well as burning down something. A few things. Possibly whole buildings.
Hmm.. I feel like I should approve of option two, but option one is significantly appealing..
The long awaited reunion took a rather... interesting turn, but all I can think about is how we'll never really find out Su-Won's deal because the season ends next week. Announce season two already!
Noooooo....it's ending so soon.
^ or be like deadman wonderland lol
... oh deadman.... why you no season 2
I want to hate Soo-won. I really do. but he makes it so hard!



he sure does :/
Just because I hate him doesn't mean I don't want to be him, right?

Jeaha knows how to sweet talk the ladies.
It's hard to think that any guy Gigan's age would leave an awesome lady like that alone.
Well one more episode definitely needs another season. Looked through the winter line up and thought about it quite a few fun ones to watch but artistry, balance, character dev, story hands down I think Yona is the best this season.
This show is the only anime I've seen in awhile that has it all. There's romance, comedy, action, story, development. It's so under rated. Oh and Hak can get it. Anytime. Anywhere. I couldn't be Yona. We would have at least kissed by now.
Hello Everyone! Man the new op has really grown on me, anybody else agree?
The beat combined with Yona's fierce eyes? Heck yes.
It keeps popping in my head annoyingly and not leaving. I think that means it's grown at me especially since I didn't like it when it first aired. I really do prefer the first OP though. It was way more fitting.
Su-won is by far one of my favourite character in this show! It is like Snape from Harry Potter, you aren't sure if he is good or evil until the end. We should figure it out sometime, but right now I'm really confused what I should think.
This is a show that doesn't really want you to think in terms of good and evil - all the characters are complicated human beings who can act with equal cruelty and kindness depending on the situation. (This is what good writing is.)
It is good writing, but I do view Su-won as 'bad' from Yona's perspective, since he essentially reasoned that the Kingdom was worth more than her fathers' life. In other words, I would have no problem with her killing him and his dreams.
^But wouldn't Yona killing Soo-won for killing her father be *exactly* the same as Soo-won killing Il for killing *his* father? I'd like to see Yona break the cycle and make a different choice. She has the strength to do that, I think.
We finally meet the fourth dragon next week! ...in time for the final episode. ( T-T )
Good MORNING everyone.
Did any of you enjoy the DAWN?
I most certainly did.
Looks like the new king was going to take care of the Kumji problem if the pirates didn't already do the job for him. Other than kill Yona's father maybe he hasn't been all that bad.
Oh, he was never THAT bad, he just made a choice that WILL end in his death. Either Yona will kill him or Dak will, and he sort-of knows it. Whether the ends justify the means doesn't change the consequences of the means themselves.


I still find that reunion scene heartbreaking. Yona's face is still swollen from the battle & there's no reaction to her condition? I finally decided they didn't get past the shock of meeting. But that goodbye was cold...
I'm gonna miss the people of Awa. But Yona must move on
i'm going to die without a season 2
