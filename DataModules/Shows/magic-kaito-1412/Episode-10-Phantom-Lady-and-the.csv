It's at times like this you notice that Ran and Aoko are practically identical...Well, Shinichi and Kaito have the same voice actor too, so I guess that's not the only parallel...
Kaito must kick ass at bumper cars.

It hasn't been flat out stated in the TV series, but Kid does KNOW who Conan is (if not any sooner than 701-704 story). MK1412 isn't exactly sticking to established timeline (within it's own episodes and connecting to DC).
who lied to you that the movies are considered Canon?
Is Conan Canon, is or Canon Conan? Haha.
Kid may or may not know that Conan is Kudo, but he DOES know that Conan is a brilliant detective that's foiled him multiple times. He probably sees him as a threat as Conan himself, and not necessarily as Shinichi.
Yeah, even disregarding the movies, in the Det. Conan cases where Kid is involved, "Conan Edogawa" is openly shown as the detective arch-rival of Kid, his name trumpeted in the papers and so on (which is ignored by the Black Org., though).
Why did they have to ruin it in the credits after opening >_> that didn't even happen yet
I thought the same thing! I then shouted "SPOILERS!".
How did kid know conan turned into a little kid?
He found out during a Conan movie, I believe.


Nice punch Aoko. I guess Kaito needed some sense knocked into him.

lol its kid detective conan
YES YES YES!!!! CROSSOVER!!!! =D I LOVE IT!!!!!!
A THIEF IN GLASSES
Best thing about this one, I think, is the revelation that the case where he met Chikage was the reason that Kid's dad got into Phantom Thieving in the first place.

Wait, did Ran always have that weird ass hair-cone?
I believe you mean her unicorn hair horn?
Apart from the first handful of manga chapters (and I think in the first episode of the anime too), yeah; she's always had the horn
Just kidding, The little Conan cameo starts at 16:45 haha
Did you guys see the little Conan cameo at 16:55? hahaha
lol its Kid detective Conan
So does any one else notice that all the Glass Bottles in Jii's bar are 2d images, that and the scaling changes evey scene.
Conan Edogawa!!
well two anime cross here very nice
oooh! I just realized this is the opposite side of the story in Detective Conan! ooooooooooh. It all makes sense. I like this very much
