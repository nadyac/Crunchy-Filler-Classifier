I wonder if "Dirty Boots" sounds as ridiculous to the japanese as it does to westerners >_@
Dirty Boots is fun to say
Japan doesnt have a problem saying anything in english. THey make it all sound fun.
It seems like if you are a dark skinned, voluptuous female on Bleach, you have unimaginable speed.
uh... all the dark skinned characters have had super speed. The Arrachnar, Yoruichi, this chick.... I think Japan is onto stereotyping :/
That's only three, and Byakuya has amazing flash step so that breaks the sterotype.
Yeah well, I'm pretty fast, but I'm neither dark skinned nor am I an anime character so... Checkmate~
@Crimsomcruz Yeah, but Yoruichi is faster than he is......
EVERYONE has a form of flash step sonido quincy speed boost. this arguement is entirely invalid. Especially when the orange haired japanese kid is constantly improving his speed to be the fastest of them all.
either he succeeds and has awesome power, or he screws up and he will die... hmmm, where have I heard that ultimatum before??? Oh that's right, EVERY TIME HE TRAINS TO GET STRONGER! those hearts need to move faster...
These chumps training Ichigo have no clue how powerful he was before he lost his powers.
i want ichigos to have his sword back mother fucker ..

@silvershroud, I'm pretty sure he knows that.
is he one person i don't even know at this point........
So the Bounts and Quincies are German based, Hollows are Spanish based, and the Fullbringers are English based.
no recap
I have a 100mb download/upload WHY IS THE STREAM LAGGING ALL THE TIME especially during the intros and outros
Also depends on your processor speed/type, graphics card and ram.
because your spiritual energy is not strong enough
woah them my reiatsu is very high man i think my pc can flashstep............sonido? idk
I hear you dude. 60MB downstream, I score at LEAST half that whenever I speed test, and you only need a consistent 2MB per second to stream at 720p... Someday, Crunchyroll itself will achieve Bankai.
Activates bankai. Watching this video in 4K resolution UHDTV on my 1000in. flat-screen plasma tv in the living room.
Lol, her Fullbring is called "Dirty Boots" and every single ad that came up was for the Puss in Boots movie... XD
That chick with the red hair has the dumbest power in history. I mean, how does blowing hearts at people and putting them in stuff help in a fight? Especially when the hearts move so slowly and an enemy can break it just by powering up?
Only fullbring worth having is one that cooks you burritos.
I wouldn't mind a fullbring that could bring out the soul of a taco and double size it.
Are you trying to bait someone into making a racist joke about Chad? Tut tut
Nice episode. Also LOL at Mr. Pork being a Nursery school teacher
Things turned out better than expected!
Riruka is cute.
Super cute. <3
everytime Shishigawara talks all I can think of is Bossun
Hahaha I know! I think Bossun is his most characteristic character (even if it's redundant). I can think of a lot more, but Bossun is special.
That's one sketchy daycare teacher...
Vending machines next to one another saying "Good" and "Black".... Not sure whether subtle racism or just a coincidence...
WHHHHHAATTT!!!! Mr. Pork is a... WHHHHHAATTT!!!!
Nice episode. Ichigo is starting to act mature now!
cue the nancy sinatra song! "these boots were made for walking...and that's just what they'll do...and baby, one day these boots are gonna walk all over you...............are you ready boots? start...walking!" :3

Really? Are you sure you don't want just regular intercourse?
I think he does. Intercourse can mean some other things. He was being pretty specific
