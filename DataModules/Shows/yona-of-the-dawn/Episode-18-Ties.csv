Just kiss already
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! Took MQB7G9SM3CH
Yona and Hak... in bed! I'm perverted
me too its what i need after watching a lie in april has stolen my happy mood
aww is lil Yona beginning to realize Hak is special in a "different" way? ^^ the look on his face was priceless LOL
best anime pairing since golden times
Jessss someone else loves golden times.
golden times ;-; choo choo
Best anime pairing? Do you mean Hak and Jeaha?
This anime always leaves me wanting more! I hate waiting a week to see the next episode....
It feels like the ep starts and then 5 minutes later it is over.
and they are so good that you you want to just binge watch all of them!


binge watch... like im doing now... its 5:30am... save me

um, in Meliodas's case isn't his better, like actually looking like a tough man well over 30 as opposed to a shorty with a baby face?
Reminds me think of Tangled. They can't get their noses right.
Toph would have loved her wanted poster if she could see it.
Couldn't help but read comments with Melodies in it lol
These guards are sure blind. They can't even get the face right. Nobody is gonna figure out who they're are with those ugly posters :l
The Green Dragon wants Hak
I expect some yaoi fanfic links asap. Go!
who DOESN'T want Hak?

thanks for V8J96KQ3P66! Im gonna enjoy this episode then the new Parasyte -the maxim- episode in an hr
*fist pound to Muhnee* why not a abit of parasyte, cliff hangers everywhere!
The saddest part of each episode is waiting for the next one :'(
They need to make a Yona Movie!!! At least 2 hours long!
At the end, tho, I'd be like, 'More!'
Hak and Jeaha together are hilarious XD Another example of great interactions between characters within this Anime.
You can tell from Yona's eyes that she wants to beat the hell out of some officials
The fire in her eyes!
I am rarely excited by the main heroine in a story. They are usually weak, whiny and worthless - even when they are the leader. Ex: Sailor Moon & Fushigi Yuugi. But I'm loving Yona of the Dawn as much as 12 Kingdoms! Kick ass already, Yona!
@Rena-Ryuugu- Even if Hak had taught her swordsmanship, I doubt she'd be kicking ass already. Realistically speaking, one doesn't become a strong with just a few months training. And this series is utterly devoted to realistic development.
Yona doesn't have the athleticism for swordsmanship.
@Darkmagick8 - 1v30 fights with the 1 coming out on top. Dragon-human mutants. Dragon gods. Dragons. Dragons. DRAGONS. Realistic development? Maybe character development, but certainly not in levels of strength.
Saying "I think you're a handsome man" right after "I want you" doesn't help people fix the idea of how you enjoy your popsicles.
Poor Yona really needs to get those flaming cataracts checked.
I approve of these flaming cataracts.
The green dragon is hilarious. I lost it when he got stuck in that pot XD
And then white snake started carrying him around like it was normal.
Kija is such a pure soul!
That is some seductive recruiting Jeaha. I forgot I was watching Shoujo for a second.
But that feels so right for a shoujo series.
It's amazing how one episode can hit some many emotions from good comedy, to cute/sweet romance building to even a extremal sad scene... Not to mention the great character building! It's the marking of a truly amazing series!!
All of the characters in this show are simultaneously so awesome and so adorable xD.
Poor Shinah always getting left behind hes my favorite!
"How did you know I was the Green Dragon?" (Maybe it was the hair color.)
Hak is love Hak is life
Hak and Jaeha are adorable together. Love how they sneaked a little bromance in the episode as well.
Hell, even without the Dragon's Blood, I'd kneel for Yona too.
You and the entire pirate crew.... :-)
compared to when she had long hair in the beginning, yona looks more and more mature as the story progresses
