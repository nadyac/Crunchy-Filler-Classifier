Had to say this again, booya! booya! booya! Kenshin!!!
You said it, that you did.

Indeed. Kenshin Himura is a skilled swordsman, that he is.
So I learned Sagara ditches a lot of restaurant tabs
tabe-nige = dine n' ditch lol
These episodes sure bring back good memories I'm falling in love with these episodes all over again! >.<
This is my first time watching Kenshin, (because I'm lame like that) and I think I love Sagara a bit. A lot actually.
Thanks for uploading more subbed episodes, Crunchyroll. I was waiting for them.
so he used the dull part otherwise it wont make any sense that he wont bleed even after getting slashed with a sword
That's what it means to carry a sakabatou (reversed-blade sword). The blade is on the wrong side of the sword, so he could slash like that all he wants and it would only deliver blunt damage.
He only flipped the sword to cut Sagara's blade, in order to finalize the fight. He flipped it again before his down stroke. ^_^
if only saint seiya omega could follow this wonderful example of battle than speech rather than speeching winning battle
And Sagara comes back!

Kenshin now needs to get a new hilt for his sakabatou or the weight at the tip of the blade will be unbalanced.
Actually, he only needed to replace the tsuba, which he did off-screen. The various pieces of the hilt of a Japanese sword are interchangeable, the tsuba especially so, as it was often the first part to break.
yep, the tsuba is mostly there for decoration, it has almost no weight. :3
it is more like goku and vegita
Sanosuke is awesome, but I love Kenshin more!
I love Sanosuke Also, new Kenshin moves: )
