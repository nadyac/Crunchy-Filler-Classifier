That basement haunts my dreams. I fear that I will never learn what lies inside.

Maybe it is 850 years from the first time the titans appeared, then they were gone and almost lost from memory, and now they are back?
I agree with @luismac023 with the people turned into Titans. Pixis told Eren of the idea of an enemy possibly forcing humans to come together. It's the most obvious origins to the Titans. They just lose their mind like Eren tries not to do.

i really just expect everyone to die and no questions be answered, to be honest. that's what i would do, that's what i expect the author to do, and we will all die inside because of it.
I think Jean's dedication for his fallen friend shows just how much he has changed from his self in the beginning. Respect.

i seriously don't understand why anyone would dislike Jean, the dude is literally the most amazingly honest of these characters. He just needed someone like Marco to show what he was capable of and give him a push in the right direction.
You get so many feels for Jean in like the first 5 minutes.
Mikasa: Did they touch you in weird places?!
@Zeroyoko1974 Thats exactly what I heard to! LOL
Eren: Well, that girl in the glasses TRIED to...
to successfully kill flies... yes
To those guys arguing about if Mikasa loves Eren or not - I'm going to say yes. Not only does she show so much affection for him already, but she did not care in the beginning when Jean complimented her on her hair
Hanji performed experiments on his Titan...
Am I the only one who thought Mikasa was cute when she was questioning Eren?
You want a girl that can kill you in seconds? When that time of the month comes...well... I'll send flowers.
Not at all! That moment was soo kawaii, though i wanned her to hug him Still.. was nice how it was
Of course, Mikasas always cute., she's my Waifu. She can baby me and kill me whenever she wants XD
Agreed.
yes
Swatting a fly away needs Titan strength...at least according to Mikasa haha
Guys, she meant that in the Titans point of view she (humans) are like fly's to them. In the fly's point of view, we humans are like titans to them. Hope that made sense, lol.
So we eat flies?
some do
I think he attacked her because he didnt want her to come along and had a huge fight about it right before they left for the mission. He seems like the Hulk but only a Titan in power from what they show so far. A huge pink rage monster.rofl
@wytknight . . . I think u r correct. it's fight that they just had... and basically he was looking at her likwe she was as pest, so that is why he "swatted" at her. He was already pissed that she was being so overprotective.
any1 else here thinking that the next episode is gonna be epic
Can't wait to see the new Titan. Mikasa is gonna open a can of whoop ass!

not quite , they could use it to hook onto the titans and launch themselves into the air that way.
t3nga I salute you just for your picture
Alright. This is my 3rd time watching this series. All I want to know (now that I'm not emotionally overwhelmed by the mission) is, why didn't they leave at night? Titans shut down at night, right? Why start a mission during the DAY?
In other words, Mikasa wants to say - "i'll make him pay for beating up by future husband"
Sayris, it may not be that way since he initially transformed while being digested, but we'll see because i refuse to spoil this awesome animation style by reading the manga.
Hate to say this, but I don't think Mikasa can take on Levi, maybe not yet at least.
Time will Tell
@yumehoshi87 that's not really the case.The translations of the manga I read (different translators could have different opinions) make it more like she knows eren would love to lose his overprotective "bodyguard" but she doesn't care
so true...
Jean: "Hey, Eren. I heard when you turned into a Titan, you tried to kill Mikasa. What does that mean?" Mikasa: "No. Eren was trying to hit a fly..." lol Mikasa! Not even together yet and already having to cover up for domestic violence xD
Please dont do that to me again.. i almost died laughing. I ban you from making funny comments.. i want to live
ROFL, you sir win this thread.
Better was how serious and macerate she was when she said this.
Well if anyone needs me, I'll be refreshing my page endlessly until episode 17 starts playing.
If only that made the episode come out faster
ikr
I am seriously guessing the party responsible for the sabotage last episode are either MPs or Wallists. If it was Wallists it is simply zealous behavior. But if it was the MPs, it means they were trying to hide something.
the Garrison, cus unless he had access to the wall, I don't know how else he could've transformed into a titan outside the walls, unless he was came from outside the wall somehow.

maybe the colossal titan is like Eren because it seemed to be somewhat intelligent when it only destroyed the wall and didn't eat anyone...
Wouldn't it be hilarious if the colossal titan popped as soon as they left the gate.
you know its going to happen though XD
I love how they focused on the other characters more than Eren this episode, it was definitely refreshing seeing things from their perspective.

Me too. They sure have hinted at her feelings towards him quite a bit. My thing is Eren doesn't seem to react much when she does.
fanfic ammo acquired..... FIRE AT WILL
@ Anim3Fre4k: Nooooo the plot bunnies!! They are invading! Evasive maneuvers!!!
The worst part of my week is realizing i need to wait a week for the next episode.
The Survey Corps ceremony was so intense, just what is the Commander planning ?!?!
If they where brave enough to stay after that, then they wont run away when things go bad. Witch means he can depend on them when he needs to.
It's better to have 10 people you will be able to depend on than 100 people that will run away when things get rough.
@wickedproxy- exactly right. 100 that will run will not only get themselves killed, but many others as well in the chaos.10 that have the courage to follow orders will at worst get only themselves killed, or they might survive and save more
Since they think that the ones who killed Bean and Sonny are trainees, I think the commander was trying to give vital information to bait the spies and then scare the non-spies away. This way, he reduces the number of people he has to watch
"This is a true salute."

Lol, I know what you mean. I've watched it three times. The music goes perfect with the scene! My favorite song off the ost too.
For some The biblical story of Gideon came to mind.
Actually that's what this series makes me think of, but especially that scene.
Props to Jean this episode!
Jean gained a ton of respect in my books this episode.


Correction, KNOWN Titans don't have reproductive organs. However, these are newly discovered/created Titans, so who knows what they have?
SHE WILL KILLED PIXIS THEN! hahahha that's all he wanted LOL a sexy female titan
^ lol XD If this happens, I have to imagine no matter how dramatic it is I'm going to be laughing my ass off.
eveytime i see vampiregirl i get a chill... dat picture
Well TECHNICALLY, breasts aren't reproductive organs.
