Play enough Basketball and you too, can learn to speed float and generate whirlwinds.
those actual basket ball players are slacking.
If basketball players had special abilities, i'd probably be more into sports.
For some reason I thought of DBZ when they were flying.
Ridiculous. Even if Kise can Perfect Copy Kuroko's pass, it shouldn't be possible for his teammate to easily *catch* it, let alone even be *ready* for it on a first-time copy. Even Kagami had to practice catching Kuroko's pass.
@xeiran His perfect copies aren't always on the fly, when Kise's copying the Generation of Miracles its from lots of practice of techniques. They most likely did practice catching it. It's not like he hid his abilities from his team
I've figured out why Riko's visual analysis is so good - she clearly has an Analytical Engine too.

I hope she didnt concede her brain to it
Nah, only part of it.
Kise: "Kuroko is an Airbender? Well, I am the Avatar!"
When is Kagami going into the ZONE? Get there already!
@Zurkx. Well.... If only the author gives KISE the ZONE too!!! Just saying! ^_^ Just give Kise, the Perfect Copy plus ZONE.... Don't need to say right???? :XP ^_^
@HEEDLESS_X_FEI and @Zurkx I know right!! but I also want Kuroko in the ZONE too!! Like I wanna see what his Zone gonna be like you know? O_o ^_^

@HEEDLESS_X_FEI The perfect copy is his "Zone". lol
ahh yes The glorious insertion of basketball into nets again. Let us begin!!!
^^ I read that in the voice of Starfire from Teen Titans and LMAO.
lol nice
You know you're best friends when you can argue and resort to name calling in the middle of a basketball game. Such a bromance Kiyoshi and Hyuga have.
Ugh... you'd think by the 60th episode I'd be used to how quick they end, but they still fly by. Well, next Saturday should be good.

Even without reading the manga you can tell they are really foreshadowing a certain player on Akashi's team.
i...don't see it
Haha yeah! When Akashi was playing against Midorima I finally noticed him in a shot. I scared my mom "Did you see that!?" Then it was "Ohh I know who he is!" Mom was like "What are you going on about?" lol
Time is almost moving as slowly as in HunterxHunter!
But faster then Dragon Ball Z
Imagine if both Kuroko and Kagami go into the zone.. omg. Imagine how unstoppable they would be, holy shit.

Kiyoshi and Hyuga. Seirin doesnt just have the Kuroko and Kagami combo.
poor Izuki must feel so left out without his personal combo...
but he does have a combo... he has the best pair of all ... izuki and puns
Wow, they were literally flying in that match with the amount they move horizontally while jumping. Like gravity d
"Leading his team to victory is the ace's job." Kise really lives up to that. Shows that he really loves his team and wants them to help them win instead of him winning just for himself
Whoa, Kiyoshi got super mad. Might be the first time I saw him like that
That last picture after the preview! LOL
Lol Yeah! It made me giggle too.
