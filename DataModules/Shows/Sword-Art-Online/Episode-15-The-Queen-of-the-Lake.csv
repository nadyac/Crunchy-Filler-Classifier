Silica was jealous. "Pull my tail too...!" ;_;
I can't help but wonder if tails, along with ears, aren't erogenous zones for a Cait Sith. Sinon's reaction IMO seemed less "He pulled on my arm until it hurt." and more "He pinched my breast! In public!" But it might just be me.
sinon has definitely joined the kirito fan club she totally perceived the tail-pulling has flirting when kirito was, hopefully, just joking
sao: *introduces interesting female character with tragic plot-line* sao: *resolves plot-line* sao: well i guess she doesn't need a unique personality anymore

I HATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Never drive American cars... Fuck you you Impereal bastard!
don't be a steph.

For a moment, I thought Kirito was going to pat Klein's head.
@imperlast I'm not sure if you're intentionally trolling with your bad spelling or you're just bad at spelling. I'm going to be generous and assume you intentionally mispelled most of the words. How did your resume get you hired?
r3trosp3c7 I agree in the beginning of season 1 klein was my favorite character
It was funny seeing his shocked response when Klein found out he was using magic after all! Then his funny "grandfather quote" "Never ride in American cars or flying elephants." LOL
Klein got a little bit close there...

"You've only been playing for 2 weeks and you want a legendary weapon?" "YOU BET YOUR FUCKIN' ASS I DO, I WANNA SHOOT PEOPLE FROM A MILE AWAY."
I think it is a new character. She wouldn't transfer her GGO char.
Yeah. It's specifically stated in the novel that she did not transfer her character from GGO but made a new character from scratch.
no excalibur will ever surpass Souls Eater's excalibur...BAKA!

If Kirito could bring a sword to a gunfight, then Sinon can bring a bow to a magic-fight... Or something like that...
Sees jellyphant... Yells out, "Appa, yip yip!"

Its from Avatar, the animated cartoon
No, they spoke Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Dude that just made my day I'm so happy
haha Glad I'm not the only one who thought Avatar: the Last Airbender!
This "arc" is just a side story in the LN but if they want to make an entire arc out of it, I'm down. Just as long as they don't skimp on Mother's Rosario...
Sure
same with me
I hope so too. I wish they didn't have to do a side story, but it'll give some more screen time for Sinon at least who doesn't really show up in the next arc.

Now that I look back at what I said I think they have enough material for two more seasons, assuming each season is four novels.
Asuna is great wife to Kirito, she obviously doesn't have a problem with him grabbing some tail every now and then
This whole thread has a tail of its own
Yeah, I agree. I didn't realize that was Sinon at first.
[This comment has been removed]
To be fair, she knows that Kirito's heart is fixed on her anyway, so why would she mind that much?
[This comment has been removed]
This looks amazing! I can't wait for the next episode. But hope that Klein gets more screen time because it seems to cut him off a lot...
I am sure Klein will show his badassness

Well at least i made Klein compensate for his lack of screentime by using him in Hollow Fragment
Kirito first rule about nekos DON'T PULL THEIR TAIL! LOL :3
typical kirito if you ask me!
And Yui rides a motha fkin dragon.
His relationship with Asuna is solid enough and she isn't the jealous type. So we get Kirito feeling secure enough to flirt. Seen that sort of thing in real life too. Poor Klein, but he wouldn't be the first guy with a younger girlfriend
Asuna is one of those "open" girlfriends.
Why would someone who knows they're loved be jealous about something that silly? I think Asuna is great because (apparently) she doesn't care.
Kirito equipping his second sword is like Ash turning his hat backwards, shit is going to get real
[This comment has been removed]
Don't compare him to ash. That just a bad analogy.
"I want to see Kirito before i return to Kyoto" Oh trust me, he would want to see you too if he was seeing what we were.....
@dsifrit: They did go to bed together (ala 16.5), just behind the scenes. You'll notice in the anime that Asuna is naked (or at least topless) in bed after the underwear incident.
Yep, the series simply did not show the action as it were, they clearly did spend the night together.
Worth noting that in SAO HF It's heavily suggested that Kirito bangs Asuna in one of the side events.
[This comment has been removed]
@Fruitpunch: What is SAO HF?
Damn I want a bathroom like Asuna's...
I don't want one like it, I want that one. The one with Asuna in it.
bu-BAM!!
I just want Asuna.
Asuna is gorgeous, though. No denying that.

I don't get it. Why do the episode 14.5 recap if you about to start a new unrelated story arc anyway?
Easy filler and cheap screentime to pad out the series I guess.
At least SAO filler is 3-4 episodes rather than other anime filler (23498757 effing episodes)... *a little sarcastic exaggeration*
seems that the SEED has been having some pretty interesting affects on mmo games behind the scenes. Wonder if that is part of what Kiayaba was up to by giving his pet program to Kirito...
Idiots who think it is filler and don't get how recaps work in Japan

Seeing asuna nake in the bath was totally necessary I mean how could we not live with asuna fanservice!
Yes, yes it was
An attempt to make up for mostly leaving her out of the last arc. Shame on anyone who started shipping Sinon lol

screw asuna it all about silica


To be fair they did say they can't fly there.
It's not that conspicuous. Nyrb is right, they can't fly down there and the only thing that's visible is the tip of the pyramid. And you can only really see it if you're high up.
0:17 Kirito starts his morning with a cup of tea. Somebody found Excalibur? FOOL!
Bakame!
Q) Nude Asuna bathing within the first 5 minutes? A) Yes. Q) Do I approve of this? A) YES!
I wish every time I did quests 80% of my group would be females.. DAMN YOU KIRITO YOU ALPHA MALE
It was pretty common in City of Heroes, since most guys would rather watch a third person FEMALE avatar in tights run around the screen, I had both. Sorta cool that this world forces gender matching with avatars.
same in destiny
someone other than me remembers City of Heroes? MY GOD... also they need to make a game with as much character options as COH >: I
I approve of these COH comments.
Dammit now you guys made me want to play it again. Hope the deal goes through soon.
Hype for the new season, show asuna nude bath scene and Kirito pulling on Sinon's tail. Yup this is going to be one great season.

My bad an arc it is * have it your way (burger king)*
After the opening credit scenes you can't tell me that the music playing isn't inspired by Chrono Trigger's "Lunar Festival" music.
There's no denying it! It's just too similar to one another
