Chickens don't give a shit about the snow.
Chickens are hardcore!! There wings are delicious!!!
This is the chicken, watch it run in slow motion. It's pretty badass. Watch it run all over the place. "Woah" says that bird. Ew it's got a snake? Oh it's chasing a jackal? Oh my gawsh D:
I think the chicken knows morse code.
I cant seem to trust snow in an anime anymore.. It either takes a wife & daughter away from a man or causes some of your friends to hibernate, while you get older. Snow & I are taking things one flake at a time. Snow = Bad JuJu!
What if Johnathan was was using morse code this whole time, explaining what the story actually means, and no one knows?
Touko has the best little sister ever.
Hina-chan = best wing-chan
wow Hina way to take one for the team
i think jonathan was the best wingman
Honestly, based on the way she was acting, I bet she thought they were having sex... xD
Aww haha Hina's phone wallpaper. The sea slug of Nagi no Asukara x)
I keep looking for this but where exactly in this episode do you see Hinas wallpaper?
@ArcAngle4580: Sea slug @ 5:30.
Hina and 5:30 wow.
Now that you mention it ...
Jonathan was like "What are you waiting for?"
I keep watching this show, nothing happens, and I don't care. Weird. The most memorable character is Jonathan. Super weird. Thanks Japan.
If you insert after the dialog the phrase "while striking provocative poses that twist their necks on top of stacked school desks " into GenjiMKE's post You have every Shaft anime made.
@GenjiMKE Couldn't have described it any better.
I really like it because it has this nice relaxing atmosphere and everything is slowly floating to it's designated place.
@GenjiMKE and @Retread. I agree with you both. It is quite a different way to write a show. Not the best I've seen as far as slice-of-life/coming-of-age stories go, but I don't hate it for that. Jonathon is the best character in my opinion.
Idk about you guys but im not even trying to understand whats going on, gave up on that about 7 episodes ago. I just turn off my brain and enjoy the ride.
Uh oh, the saltflake snow has started to fall! They need to make an Ojoshi to offer to the Sea God before it's too late! o.O
*Ojoshi-sama. Where's your manners?
Kakeru don't be an ass. You don't get girls to fall for you & then leave! Kinda glad for HiroxSaachan. I'll admit I kinda hate Saachan but Hiro deserves a nice ending! I still don't get what the snow means but I know that Jonathan's a pimp!
to me, snow = broken heart due to separation. Hopefully , Kakeru will stop being an ass and man-up though.
snow= purity, new beginnings, rebirth
IMHO Snow=Cold=Loneliness ("sudden and expected loneliness")
Well.... Everyone should know Snow = _____ In Clannad... who knows? )X
Well in a previous episode, someone mentioned the world is a snowglobe. The snow symbolizes the world being shaken, but nothing changes. It's all still the same, no matter how it looks.
That sea slug from Nagiasu. I see what you did there, PA Works
Am I the only one who cant find this? At which point do you see this?
5:30
First it was the girls swim team, now it's the girls from the dance studio. Yukinari is still as popular as ever with the ladies.
But he can't be with the girl who he really wants :'(
I still have no idea of what's going on in this show... But I like it for some reason, I just don't know what makes me like it!?!
It's Johnathan of course that's why we all watch this show you silly rabbit < oo>
@TheOmegaForce70941 I second that statement lol, feel the same way.
Johnathan is such a player.
Of course. He gets all the chicks, after all. ;-)
this is the second time pa works done this lol
Don't egg him on!
Two more episodes and I have no clue what the hell is going on still. Either this anime is a stroke of genius or a schizophrenic person wrote it.
Teens are dealing with romance. Sharing interests, hobbies, and experiencing the same events gets them closer to each other and helps to form couples. I wouldn't call it genius, but it's certainly a decent romantic drama show.
Oh, and it's also a story about Kakeru being indecisive about his life and scared to make a step towards independence. Should he stay with Touko who makes him feel home or stay with mom to keep experiencing the sudden, expected loneliness.
Hina sure is duking it out with Johnathan for the best character title in this.

i KNOW RIGHT?! SO CONFUSED!!!
If I had to guess, Saachi still isn't sure yet. When someone is nearby, you can hear their voice, but you can't see them. There is the possibility that she's feeling lost, and that even though he's right there, she is emotionally troubled.
"The other person is nearby but you can't see her". Then he asks "can you see me?" and she replies "I can't see too well yet". I think she meant that her feelings for Hiro are not clear yet.
Usually after each episode I am left perturbed. This episode I am left perturbed that I wasn't left perturbed at the end of the episode. I can't see this show reaching great status but looks like we might get a decent ending at least.

And the sea slug on the little sister's phone
Well if we believe in "future fragments" then isn't just the next time this will happen or you will feel this way is during the winter?
some of the character have blues eyes so maybe they do lol
The things she said going back with Hiro are probably just the way she feels about him. It's all about poetry, symbolism and metaphors.
The OP song has grown on to me for some reason now.
Any ChouCho or nano.RIPE song always grow on me.
Grew on me, too. As did the show. You can get the FULL version on the CD from Japan on Amazon for about 17.00. Full version is almost 4:00 long.
Patients people, next episode should be the ah-ha moment
I hope Jonathan has a lot of fun playing in the snow.
Will we ever get an answer to those fragments? probably never
I'm pretty sure they are just a metaphor.
