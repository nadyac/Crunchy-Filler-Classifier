You can say he just doesn't have the balls to tell her
XD lol!!
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
LOL forreal
"The fullmetal Ballchemist"
"The fullmetal Ballchemist" LMAO XXXXXXDDDDD MY SIDE HURTS
never thought an anime would make me very concern for a character's balls or lack of....XD
LOL FULLMETAL BALLCHEMIST HAHAH
I'm going to guess there will be a lot of ball references in the coming up episodes LOL. I wonder if they will ever know the truth
omg that was the hardest ive ever laughed at any anime
Man, Erec is a lot like Gintoki from Gintama. Especially with the constant ball jokes. And those facial expressions!
Best line in the whole episode XD
hilarious, LMFAO
first anime devoted to a guys family jewels, lol
Do you guys even have gintama?
I have kintama
Don't get them mixed up.
poor him! got a pretty fiancee but don't have balls >-<
ROFL LOL THE FULLMETAL BALLCHEMIST
"i dont need my balls to love you!" LOL
At least he ain't nuts
poor Eric-sama.....at least least buy a couple of marbles, she will never know the difference. O_o,
Those parts cannot be purchased. $10 per marble 90% Christmas sale! one time only + free shipping!!
:(( hope through some magic he gets the fam jewels back!! poor guy
*teary eyes...* Erec-san is still so cool.. But why is the author so cruel to make him fall into such an unfortunate situation that he is in right now? I am most concern about Erec-san's situation than DT's situation, being in a diff world.
damn ED is so cool even though he has no balls
FULL METAL BALLCHEMIST LOL
Well they certainly did a decent job taking away his "bad guy" edge. To what end we can only guess at this point.
