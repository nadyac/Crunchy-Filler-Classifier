I now finding myself saying "gozaru" at the weirdest moments. Thank you, Kenshin.
I thought kenshin was going to summon chief toad or something when he slammed his hand on the floor mat lol
the "oh-hohoho" laugh.
For being able to swing a massive sword around Sagara almost looks anorexic
Boy this little town can never get a break.
Its tokyo
He bearly won! Amazing that the subs never got proofed and corrected... but I still love the "Kenshin-gumi" LOL.
sagara just tasted it like it was no big deal, what if it was ninja poison or something?
Well he has incredible stamina after all and it was just a little.
That shockwave to the floor moment, even if it wasn't too big a deal, was super BA. Lol.
We got so much content in this episode I was wondering if it lasted an hour instead of half hour. 0.0 So much went down! I'm excited for the Oniwabanshu, samurai are better than ninja!
The subs are ancient too... and hard-subbed and just re-uploaded. So translations ain't that good.
Kenshingumi .. heh ..
Yahiko...
Kenshin is the best

Did they cut the part where the big guy drank from the barrel? We only saw him drop it. Makes me wonder if there were other alterations.
