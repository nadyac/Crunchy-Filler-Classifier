There's someone I want you to meet...Sinon, please, meet the other members of my harem :>
SANDWICH-CHAN!!!!!!!!!! DOKO DESUKA?????
from video games to women, kirito is an all-around player
HA! He totally made fun of the older characters!
@Tibbynibby Wait... Klein, Asuna, the blacksmith girl, Silica, Egil, etc. are not friendly with Kirito? How is that possible when they are all part of the good guy force? Jealousy? Revenge for some small matter?
kirito can officially say he has been around the block!
'These are my friends.' I dunno how Asuna DIDN'T murder him for that line.
I was waiting for Asuna to explode a bit to break the ice xD
Berserk Healer? That's what she is in ALO, not SAO.. He introduced them as SAO friends.. :S Shoulda said Fencing Ace or something, or her nickname from SAO..
Kirito totally friend-zoned his virtual babymamma and got away with it. LOL It was probably done to progress a love triangle that otherwise would not have happened if Sion knew about their relationship. It's almost poor writing.
HOLY CRAP! How did Asuna not kill him right there!?
i feel accomplished for getting you to +2k x_x
This is my "friend" Asuna
#friendzoned
@stanton2479 Reminds me of Shrek is love Shrek is life...
dammit stanton, i listened to the whole fu*king thing
@chris49ford i hate you soooooo much now i cant stop watching AMVs
Heh his FRIEND, who is he kidding?
Good for you Sinon. You took a lot of steps this episode. That ending was particularly heartwarming.

Harem wars here we go!!!
I'll admit that I kind of teared up when the little girl told Sinon thank you. That was cute and heartwarming like you said @ShawnHacaga. And it was as Kirito said about thinking about the people that she saved.
"Is he your boyfriend Asada-san? *giggle giggle* oooooh"
Asuna vs Sinon !!! Pay per view!! The battle of the century!
A-ASADA-SAN ASADA-SAN ASADA-SAN his mouth was foaming and everything. asada-san...
I'm not gonna lie I got a lump in my throat at 21:24
He looked like a dog during that. Also seriously can't believe Asada-san sympathizes for him after it's all over, he tried to rape her and kill Kirito. Like srsly no plz.
If I'd bad stats for a toon, I'd just pay some gold to reset my stats. If that din't work, I'd just delete that toon & roll a new one. Wonder why her creepy classmate din't just do that? It would've been easier than becoming a serial killer
Carne Asada San! My mouth would've been foaming too...
I was at school watching this episode and my teacher came from behind and saw that part as I watched it, he just laughed. I felt so awkward.
Soo, Kirito pretty much refuses to acknowledge Asuna as his girlfriend/wife? Yeah, that sure goes over well most of the time.

Can't forget that Kirito/Asuna did have an adopted daughter together...
its a japanese thing to be modest and humble and not to brag about accomplishments such as a girlfriend
@pwnyomomma i think your talking about the psp vita game. that story that has sinion in sao is not canon.
Japanese culture and not bragging is bullshit! I live in the US and if I had a girlfrind like Asuna I would be talking non-stop about it!!
"Meet my... friends"...? Wait wtf Kirito, did you friend zone Asuna?!
But....But....The glasses doe...So kawaii.

@Kenthian - Neither have I, but the writer obviously spent more time on Shino because the whole arc was practically about her, whereas in SAO it was mainly about survival.
This season is about Sinon. so they're trying to limit the story of Kirito and Asuna, but i wish they would just show the couple as a lovey dovey couple just a little bit. ^_^
Well, that was nicely handled. Well done, Kirito and Asuna, for helping Sinon out like that. Sadly, now he has to tell her that he and Asuna are a couple, and that could get awkward.

so why didn't the syringe thing work on Kirito?
because he's Kirito don't question it
I think it has something to do with the Circle-shaped Heart Monitor near his chest..
It's basically that because he rushed out of the monitoring room he probably forgot to take the electrode of which stopped the syringe piercing his skin. you know like a lighter would stop a bullet in some films shit like that.
Don't cry all over the picture she worked hard to make it!
I know, what a bitch. If I was that little girl I would have slapped the shit out of her, "Don't get your feeble tears on my art woman!!".
That bitch is the reason she is alive so she does not care that the person who saved her mom and her life is crying on the artwork she made.
Did anyone catch the half second of color in the reflection in her eyes as she's looking at the picture? that was a nice touch in the animation.
in 1080p i have to say, thoses tears wear truly majestic as fuq
@16:37 "Oh, so this is the floozie you've been spending all your time with, Kirito-kun?"
Kirito is a pimp. But seriously no girlfriend is okay with her man getting that close with another woman when said woman has feelings for him. I think Asuna is okay with Kirito's playa status as long as she is the bottom bitch.

my eyes are raining, a tender rain /sniff
^ I just finished binge-watching that. The tender rain has been on and off for the last few hours T~T
The feels man!!! The feels!!!
Pedro's tears, they are flowing like waterfalls!
@: rmiller1656: Nice Excel Saga reference. Thumbs up! And yes, Deadly's tears, they are flowing like waterfalls, too...
People it's still going by the way. It's going to the Mother Rosario arc. Stop saying it's ending! There is even an episode preview title thing at end.
@CoffeeGodEddy no it's just the name of the arc
some people say it will be an awesome arc.... don't really know since i haven't read the LN.
Mother's Rosario is a mix of ALO & RL.
Mother's Rosario is good, but, damn, I can't wait for the underworld arc once it is finished!

"I should warn you. I have a tiny bulletproof shield the exact size of a bullet, somewhere on my body. And if you hit it, I'll be unharmed and your plan will be foiled. You'll be the laughing stock of me!"
Kirito is!
Watch the fight again he stopped fighting to tell her to run
dat moment when you thought you were injected by a life threatening chemical and have an overly dramatic life crippling fake out caused by a placebo effect
Bro....you can tell someone to run without continuing to beat the holy hell out of somebody. But hey, it made for a more dramatic (see: bullshit) fight.
Lol nice quote... thought I heard it from somewhere before. I even read it in Adam West's voice xD
Today's episode brought to you by: Feels.
Man what a great way to end that episode. Just wish my eyes didn't get dust in them during it.
who the hell started cutting onions at the end of this show??
so. many. onions.
The onions are on my eyes! ON THEM!
I got spooked when that thing was in Kirito's chest. I was like, "NO KIRITO-KUN!"
same
But then you need to remember that he has the power of MC... he will never die nor any important characters [at least in this series]
This has to go on record as the first adamantium nipple clamp plot device used to save the MC. Up until now it's always been the 'overly large/dense object in a shirt pocket that somehow doesn't show through clothing'
The psychic nurse left it there knowing Kirito was going to get injected with a deadly drug there. That ungrateful bastard Kirito owes her his life.
Why did Kirito never introduce AGIL. HE WAS RIGHT THERE. KIRITO PLS.
I know right that was kinda rude.
SOMEONE SAID IT! I was wondering why everyone was talking about everything else except that. I frowned upon Kirito being rude.
WTF? When is Kirito going to fucking tell that he already has a girlfriend.
He's not. He realised that Sinon is best girl and decided to switch teams. I wish.
"please be our friend" = "please join our harem"

I completely agree
