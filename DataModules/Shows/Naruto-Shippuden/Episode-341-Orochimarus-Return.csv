My body is shaking in excitement with all the events that are gonna happen soon! Ohhh! So Exciteddd!!
@stepperx. I have to disagree with you. Anime come from Manga that got popular. I know it is not the same but if it weren't for the people that read the Naruto's manga. We would not have a Naruto's Anime to watch.
@stepprex,mAN bro u totally forgot the background music didnt u?!
@tepprex you might want to give the manga a chance bro without the manga we would not be here today watching it
Honestly i prefer anime too but the problem is that the anime is soo far behind and just the thought of new naruto content is out there i just gotta read manga man!
I just Blame Shonen Jump and not just there timing of introduction but there expansion of products and stuff Lol. Shonen Jump is just to good so many of there productions are legend.
when suigetsu hid behind kabuto xD
Naruto's headband is messed up at 18:14 look! xD I can't believe I actually saw that!
I haven't red the mange, but after seeing the latest intro, it's obvious what's going to happen next.
its funny that people r downvoting leathercandle just because they dont know what his headband is supposed to look like... noobs. lol
@festyI felt bad for him so I gave him his +1 back lol
Killer B and his dream at 20:25
Is it strange to miss Pervy Sage right now...?
but kabuto had sugetu's ability to turn into water right? so retrieving jirya's body wouldn't be a problem (too lazy to spell)
I stopped any naruto related stuff for a year once gamasennin died. Its a totally different series without him, wish that kishimoto didnt kill him off.
Almost Sharted Myself When I saw the Title
sasuto17 he didnt have suigetsu's exact abillity just his own form of it addapted to shred skin like a snkae
ERO SENIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Drugged myself at 7pm so I could wake up at 4am with a full nights sleep and watch this as soon as possible. Yep. In total control of my life.
well, well done.How the hell do I respond to this ?
that's a lot of sleep, you must have a hard day to need that much sleep

That's called dedication my friend, I have changed my sleeping habits to fit release dates of my shows and staying up late to marathon... but, yet to have drugged myself lol
Did anyone else notice the vague reference to Kabuto's... Snake?

Suigetsu remains my single favorite character in the show. I still think he's the only one whose take on things really completely makes sense to me.
Suigetsu's the one who says what we're all thinking.
Suigetsu: "If you bring him back, he'll just go after your body again!" Sasuke: "Nah, it'll be cool." Orochimaru: "Sasuke. I want your body..." Suigetsu: "Why doesn't anybody listen to me?" Me: "I know, right?"
suigetsu and orochimaru are 2 of my fav 'bad guys' of all time. They are not illogically evil, they are just selfish... and pretty damn smart usually. Too bad they dont get along, if they just killed sauske they would be a pretty badass duo
he's baaaaaaaaaaaaaack
Heeeeeeeereeeee's johnny!
Just when something exciting is about to happen......

And just like that... another Cliff Hanger....
The only thing to relieve the stress of finals <3
So true... -.-

lol i did
I thought it was just because I finished re-watching AoT, but he sounded slightly more like Levi to me. His voice has the same depth -- just more strength to it? Hard to explain.
"I dream of grown women's boobs....So round!" Oh Bee, you never cease to amuse me. 10/10 for your poem.
It would be awesome if pervy sage got reanimated and fought Naruto
what about minato?
Cause Kabuto didn't have Minato's DNA, but trust me from here on shit is gonna get real. Everyone here will be shocker, get a heartbreak and probably cry. The episodes to come are the best out of the whole anime.
[This comment has been removed]
He actually did have his DNA but Minato's soul is already sealed in the death god
3 amazing events happening at the same time!? Can't believe they actually pulled this off.
leave it to orochimaru to be so open about wanting Sasuke's body. It's funny every time i hear him say I'm not strong enough right now to steal his young body, but soon I will have it.
Such a good episode! It was great to get so much plot development in one episode!
Anyone else in love with Itachi's theme song?
It's fitting for him.
Dem.. this episode is good, just like the previous ones. I GIVE IT 100 Thumbs up.
You might want to see a doctor about those thumbs, pretty sure that's not natural.
I'm not sure how to respond to this.. 'x
I think Mukurowl cut off 50 people's thumbs to show that he/she approves this episode.
GRRRR i h8 it when sasuke ignores suigetsu, the guys obviously flipping out after being incarcerated and experimented on.
I never thought of it like that before...
Same here.
Yeah I enjoyed this episode too, it was fillerless and the animation was good instead of child scribble
good chapter of the manga and a good episode of the anime, good week to be a naruto fan.
Due to the insomnia finals has caused...i can now also watch this ep as soon as it comes out
So little sheep, sentences our difficult two due and I've forgotten watt a good knights sheep evan feals lick. I'm starting two eight finals.
BAH, another great ep. Some good shiot coming soon. Not that he is the nicest guy but im glad Orochimaru is back.. One of my favorite bad guys, interested to see how he will come into play..
