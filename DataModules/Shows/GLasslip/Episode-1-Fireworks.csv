Right... so why was everyone mad at him? Did I miss him stabbing someone?
yep this is what is portrayed in Japanese culture as in the nail that sticks out gets hammered down. If you don't do things according to social ordinance you get "hammered" down in some way... it's real lol story material there
I think that what Annie999Apam says is most likely correct. Not only that but saying random stuff like, "I saw what you saw on that day." Adds to the, who the heck do you think you are attitude.
It's more like, "A new challenger has appeared!"
LOL
I can see why this show is rated 3 .-.
Arrrrrrrrrgh, NO. You do NOT stare directly into the kiln without eye protection.
Under aged child labor too.
I dunno.It's possible to draw moe characters with safety goggles. Look at C3-bu!
Fuck it, its anime logic.

@Stanhry She is a third year in high school so about 17.
wtf is going on? I am confused... so everyone's attracted to everyone? whoa...
I'M SO DAMN CONFUSED. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AAAAAAAAH SOMEONE EXPLAIN. JUST SPOILER YOUR COMMENT, GOD DAMN.
The way I saw it was Yanagi likes Yuki, Yuki has a crush on Touko, Touko is intrigued by Kakeru, Hiro likes Sachi, Sachi is overprotective/caring over Touko, and none of them (except Touko) likes Kakeru..... i think >.<
I just wanna point out that a few people called the new guy Jonathan.. that's the chicken's name...
@h20poloboy If you're referring to @aWatcher and @bobmonkeys comments, I think they are truly and wonderfully talking about Jonathan the chicken, not the transfer student "David" guy (who can not hold a torch to his feathered adversary).
@h20poloboy nice profile picture
"I saw what you saw that night," "Me too!" "Yay! We all saw fireworks!" "No, that's not what I'm-" "FIREWORKS DAMMIT!"
It's like Ano Natsu de Matteru, only more complicated... That had aliens
Greenhousegirl--------> I miss Brynhilr too but it is time to move on..
What exactly did he mean by "I saw what you saw" is he literally just referring to the fireworks? And his statement is meant to feel stalkerish? Or was there something significant that she saw that he also did?
He saw... the futuru!
I think his face was in a firework when she wore the glasses
Hanasuka Iroha + Tari Tari + true tears + Nagi No Asukara = GLASSLIP
PA Works always has a consistent way of making anime.
Johnathan is also Dera-chan from Tamako Market
plot twist, Jonathan is actually the decedent of the chicken from True Tears.. this is in the FUTURE!!
Ok Ok well idk know about u guys but im NOT a chicken thank u
What about Non Non Biyori?
Does Okikura remind you of Tsumugu while Touko remind you of Manaka from Nagi-Asu? Just saying... for those who watched Nagi-Asu.
The guy that likes touka reminds me of hikari
[This comment has been removed]
people keep comenting about anohana and nagi asu, so i watched it. thanks to them i spent my entire week feeling bad about myself, hope your happy
I believe that the producer is the same... right?
Yeah, I was all "Tsumugu, is that you?"
Hmmm.... I don't think David is liked much by them...
i dont like him either but thats my first episode impression
Its only the first episode. First we gotta get a grasp of the characters then we'll get heavy character development then finished with loads of drama. Basically the Nagi no Asukara formula.
Walk in to the club and they like whats up? Yo, man your cocks are in danger. AHHHH, I think I'll ask him out.
first anohana; then nagi no asukara; and now glasslip. I can't wait for all the feels
It has been reported that during the time Anohana aired, probability of suicides raised substantially. No one knows why, but lot of water-like substance has been found between the corpses and monitor.
Completely and utterly true. I made my friend watch Anohana who says that he "hates" anime, and he was crying so much. I kind of felt bad, but it was totally worth it.
I actually didn't cry until the end and then I only cried a little bit. On the other hand it is one of the few animes I've watched where I hated literally all but like 2 characters through the ENTIRE show and still liked the show.
Most of the girls were horrible people and the crossdressing guy was a jackass. I wanted to punch so many of them in the face. But it was a good anime.
Finally someone I can agree with about AnoHana.
chickens
@iskandos @ishida617 you are so beautiful to me!
@ishida617 LOL, I am guessing there are a ton of folks that have no idea what show that's from. But let's just hope the finale isn't giving a giant chicken a shampoo enema.
Jonathan could be the best chicken, but don't forget Marx.
What about Jibeta?
I have a cock. It's name is Nagoya.
Oh PA Works, you never cease to impress me with your shiny animation and shinier feels!

I haven't seen an anime yet that didn't have frozen images and zoom in spots.. the quality of the art was first rate. The first episode was interesting enough that I forgot it was a new anime and looked for the next episode. lol
Well, the only time I noticed a freeze/zoom was when it was done as an intentional artistic effect. I thought the art was very well done! Loved the extra detail in the backgrounds (not just the textures, but animated background filler too).
It got to the point that if I see an anime made by PA Works then I'm immediately sold. They're so good in every aspect.
Iska is right they didn't freeze the picture to save money it was to add a stronger effect to the scene
Im going to be completely honest. Not the best first impression of a show. Yes the art style is gorgeous, orgasmic even but it failed to capture me in a trance. But I will never abandon the 4 episode rule when starting a new show. Aschente.
Oh my god, no game no life reference.
Mine's a 3 Episode Rule...but this one's got me from the get go haha
Worth watching for Jonathan.
arhtus, i'm still trying to get over the fact that no game no life is over. Now I must go watch the show all over again.
lol i have a 4 episode rule too, loved the no game no life reference!
I'm not sure what to think about watching the first episode lol. I have no idea whether I like this show or not, I plan on watching the next episode though.
I watch this show for the chicks.
It's the first episode, and we already have love hexagons.
So we may need extra graph paper to chart this one out? =P
lol I was just cleaning out my desk. Found a ton of graph paper pads from all the way back in elementary school. I'm all set. xD
P.A. Works doing what they do.
This escalated quickly.
Graph paper? You'll need a bunch of those little balls on sticks they use to make a DNA double helix, & even that will be tricky!!
Not bad! I'm starting to like this show! Tastes like chicken!
Like what just happened? All I got is that they are friends and one girl has a fascination with fireworks and chickens, and everyone likes each other or something?
Yeah.. normally I can pick up on vague plots and all but this episode really seemed to just be random and rather insanely vague. It doesn't leave me wanting to watch more like most first episodes do.:( I
I just hope they realize that chicken shit is wet and slimy, gross if one is inside the house it would be a disaster.
I always love a good love conflict in anime!!!! They always give me a thrill!!!! >_<



it's because he's not chocolat
Isn't he using her first name without any honorifics?
So...Many...Chickens!
I'm shocked they play it off as though so many people would accept a chicken in the house. They are ravenous little beasts that shit CONSTANTLY. And I didn't see a single chicken diaper. I can't imagine the mess. D:
