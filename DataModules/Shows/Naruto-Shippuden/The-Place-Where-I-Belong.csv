If I die of old age before we get out of this filler will somene visit my grave and tell me what happens?
We need a filler with Konohamaru.. and he should of been in this second chunin exam. SHowing how he learned the resgenan and using it to surprise everyone
i am getting so bored of this freaking Chunin exams thing when will the pain end for us Someone also visit my grave when it's all over and plz also leave the mangas im sure im not the only one who totally if it were up to them end the exam
I wish the ten tails would throw a beast tail bomb right where the chunin exam occur! XD
Don't worry, if we die, we'll just get reanimated like everyone else, doesn't even matter if you're in the show or not.
Sure I'll visit you, But I dont know if after you die of old age, I would die of old age untill filler ends as well.
Ever notice how the openings now literally spoil and show everything that's going to happen that season?
This is why I skip them.
If that happens (which it doesn't always), then we will get to the end of the next to last chapter from the manga this season ... big IF there though.
They do spoil a lot but the manga has been done for half a year almost? And this fillier has been going on for about 2-3 months. I'm sure most have gone and read the manga instead of waiting on this.
I'm ok with it, I already read the Manga so I dont give a crap.

Once they finish this series they seriously should consider re-releasing something similar to DBZ Kai without the fillers.
See also Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood And not just without actual filler episodes but without the ridiculous amount of padding that made its way into canon episodes, slowing down scenes way too much, repeatedly overexplaining things etc
Is it just me or did this feel like a filler episode inside of a filler arc?
Madara Wins... We are in the Eternal Filler.
You guys have it wrong. The main story arch is now the filler story line. All of the fillers are now the main story.
The thing is... I still enjoyed the episode. I won't call it "great" but at least as far as fillers go, it was good. And this is Naruto; isn't that Japanese for "Maximum Episode Count"?

@stormed81 - So... Fillception?

I like the new opening and ending.. but the fillers man.. ..it doesn't fit the fillers at all since it's canon.
That Uchiha madara greatness in the ending
Seriously, that ending is literally the best thing I've seen in this show in like three months. I am going to have such a ladyboner for Madara when he finally fricking gets back into the show.
New ending, naughty Madara and that cheeky smile
awwww new intro
Guy sensi with mooostash o_o

If you've read the manga, then you know who that man with the mustache is.

Lmao. Where is Naruto? I'm guessing there going to make a Filler for every single character god damn dude..
Awkward moment when a show doesn't want to end so it desperately holds onto even the least cared about characters from the series.

Don't forget Asuma-sensei from way back!
Atleast the opening and ending are <3
notice me senpai <3

The new opening is awesome, can't wait for the the non-filler episodes to start back up again
What the hell is even going on anymore? Where and when are we?
We get a new intro about the war but they might as well as made the intro for this stupid filler thats probably going to be 24 episodes...
This is a filler flashback within a filler flashback. No progress made on the filler plot arc. What main plot arc? Those don't exist.
What kind of BS is this?! We're seeing the episodes through intros and endings now?!
lol you could say it's like that. These fillers are going to carry on through the spring season! I'm guessing we will return to the main story in summer!
