I wasn't ready for that
Well it's kinda true even now at episode 25

22:09 Mikasa's spider-man senses are tingling!



I am seriously speechless after watching this episode - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It had the same feel as the first episode but up a level or so. And that ending...just wow. Next week can't come fast enough!
This series is epic.
I agree, as it isn't rolling, yet...
how is titan similar to game of thrones?
People are dying left and right . . .
Speaking of Game of Thrones, THE HUMANS SHALL SEND THEIR REGARDS




twhy is santa claus in Attack on Titan?
Cause Santa Claus is mad at all of us. We've been sinned! 0_0
All of the titans have excellent teeth.
Could be that humans are kinda like strawberries. Maybe human blood whitens their teeth naturally. :|
@Oldthrashbar - That's what I was thinking. It's just to instantaneously case-closed with the dude. I mean, we want to know what was with the key... and the needle shot.

Thats realistic. Thats what makes the show legit period.
Epic!
YOU CAN'T END IT LIKE THAT!
Even longer than the cliffhanger in The Unlimited, where they placed 2 flashback episodes right in the middle and didn't get back to the story until the week after?
... Yes, sounds about right, Phantom. Next ep IS a flashback ep. And if they follow the manga the ep after won't show what happened.

Well duh. Of course they do. All the people they devour probably claw/sword their way out or try to and in the end, it just ends up cleaning their teeth.
WHAT A TWIST!!

What bright side? ... I don't know but when we find it we should look at it!
I'm not even gonna look at the comments here or on FB at the risk of spoilers. NOTHING WILL RUIN THE NEXT EPI FOR ME!!!
Yeah best to wait until the next episode or probably the next next episode.
I want to wait but then I want to know what happens... what should I do?


smug readers of the manga: please be considerate and keep your spoiler thoughts to yourselves.

lol @ smug. +69

Just so you all know, FlyKiller is wrong...
The ending gave me shivers.
It made me hungry.
gave me the shits...

Gave me goosebumps. 1st and 2nd watch-through.



I blame inertia
Agreed. The titans were much more agile than expected. I would've thought training would emphasize teamwork. like shooting their eyes tying up limbs, and then aiming for the neck.
elev8d I dissagree, I think it shows they're evolving i.e. The human eyes that grabbed the cord and the agility. The fact some of them specialize.
Pixis is the most unmanly name ever
I dunno...I kinda think Pixis sounds pretty bad ass.
I agree forgestar...Pixis is a new one for me and a pretty awesome name
LOL Though Pixis isn't uncommon for a German last name. Dot was an (older) nickname for females, eg first name Dorothy. Still,.seems like the mangaka read some english computer graphics mag to generate this guy's name(dot pic/pix|pixels)...
Pixas is a baddass though.
Reboot!
Lol, the Titan used Teleport no Jutsu

It's like Clash of Clans. You can't just drop a giant inside the wall unless there's an empty space.

Attack on Titan + Monthy Python. I would totally watch that show.


but he's in Luck CR just got Gurren Laggan. Go now you heathen see the glory of Kamina and be enlightened.
He did not. But you ARE asking for spoilers. Big spoilers. I'm tempted between you and the guy above hating on the manga readers.

LMAO Phantom Gundam...LMFAO
I thought Santa only punished naughty children.

For a walking, naked titan, they sure look clean. The Titan's beard was white. No previous blood stains. :|

Armin needs to redeem himself in the next few episodes.
Well, Armin does become one of my favorite characters later on, so I'm much more inclined to cut him some slack now, but...Yeah, this is his lowest point in terms of usefulness.
I'm sure it'll happen once he gets to show off his smarts. Physical battling was never his strong suit.


I think Pixis will come in and cut the neck to kill it and Eren will be fine. I haven't read the manga or have any thing so this is just a guess. I do wonder what they will do with his body though.

where did you find the scan?
@jbavuso I got it from the library, but I think mangapark or mangareader might have it... or maybe mangapanda.....
Does anyone else get immense shivers down their spine as they watch this show? Or is that just me?
It terrifying how you see them from a distance and they look so innocent, like retarded children who just got off the special bus. Then, they start eating, all the time with that same distant expression of playful happiness.
I get shivers down my spine literally EVERY EPISODE...
I usually just find it amusing, sort of like a Tarantino film. If they didn't play with their food in such a ridiculous manner and the like, it would feel more realistic and scary.
what could be more scary than playful, happy and unstopalble monsters eating everyone you love. Sounds like the height of terror to me. The surreal makes it harder to except and understand therefore more producing the mind numbing fear.
this show is just that spine tingling my spine gets messed up because it happens so much hahaha

^ I read the comments for discussions on the episode, not spoilers for the next. I want to be kept in suspense. It makes it more intriguing imo. Be considerate for those who want to discuss the present not be aware of the future.
Meh, what I posted in this thread was a manga spoiler, but one of absolutely no consequence that will be mentioned out of hand if it is handled like it was in the manga.
No, spoilers are about next episodes (anime/manga). Just read/write comments after watching the episode. There's also people re-watching that want to talk about what happens later, that's what the spoiler marker is for.
There is a spoiler box for people to check for a reason. I swear some people just want to ruin other peoples dreams of happiness and enjoyment of a series
This series is new
