All those inflatable gigai Urahara has laying around and they can't loan one to Kon? Like he's supposed to be useful as a frickin' teddy bear?
Seriously i was thinking the same thing , considering how strong Kon was when they introduced him -_-

Hahah me too!!!
Well the inflatable gigais are better used as decoys than anything else.
Yeah, Ichigo gor wrecked by kon.
So does anyone also want to see Ichigo lose control and woops some ass ?

I've been waiting for that since the last time he went vasto lorde. I'd pay a dollar to see that happen again (through the story arc, not youtube... it's been played out).
i miss nel =(
More important question, what happened to Nel? Seriously, that Aizen arc had the vaguest ending ever in both the anime & manga....
IKR?!?! I was so confused!! I mean, she got like, knocked out and then we never see her again!! What the crap?!?! I'm still confused with the ending as well!
seriously they need to bring some of these character once in while... Nel, hirako.
i miss ulquiorra so much....
When are we going to see Nel again?
I really don't know why they don't just give Kon a Gigai i can't stand him being helpless kinda makes me wanna cry.
Even in that silly outfit I love Kisuke.
Neeeeeeeellll!!!!!!!!!! I MISS U!!!! Actually I miss the whole Arrancar Arc but stil...Neeeeeellliieeeellllll!!!!!!!!!!!!
how did .. kon fling himself while hes stuck to a probabbly 1000 pound rock to him..
Kon does not skip leg day
Urahara said that Ichigo would only get his Shinigami powers back through the process so why is his hollow powers also back but out of control?
he lost his shinigami powers but his hollow powers don't count as part of them, when he lost his shinigami powers he lost his hollow ones cause he doesnt know how to use them without being in shinigami form
Mother of god kiske took of his hat!
So...much...white.....! Haori's......EVERYWHERE!!!! So.....many....captains..... AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
God bless Google Chrome Ad block. It is fantastic!
Go Urahara!
