Best part even in the Manga!
I scrolled down here to make the same reference but sure enough the top comment beat me by more than a month
Ecchi-Go: I think you meant Fire Tribe. Wind Tribe are the good guys helping the princess.
I thought it was a Misstranslation on Chruncyroll's part. But then I thought about it...
I actually thought they killed someone else at first, then said, "no, he's still alive", and then he said it himself. I loved that bit
Is this a good time to say.. " And then everything changed when the Fire Tribe attacked." ? Well, by blocking the river... The Wind Clan's like, "Dam!"
General Gang is clearly the source of the Fire Nation Royal Family's personality issues.
ha! i made the same connection as you guys!
When I heard air and fire tribes i was like "everything changed when the fire nation attacked" too!
They even look like Avatar's fire tribe.
This whole anime is beginning to give me a bit of an Avatar feel
Is everyone from the Wind Tribe a badass? Damn, when Mundok shed that tear I had some chills in my spine.
2 completely different characters.
I think Hak's dad is even more badass than Hak himself.
I envision Hak and Aang having a bigger badass competition, with Hak showing up and swooping around fiercely with his weapon and Aang just doing his whirly marble-between-his-hands trick.
The wind rises...
yeah, I would hate to see the wind tribe break...that would be awful! and smelly too! lmao!
"It's fine. You can live a carefree life here." Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go stare sexily out at the moon.
That disclaimer at the end threw me. There are people out there mistaking this as real history?
It seems similar to the type of disclaimers we have on shows & movies here in the States.
No, this is real Chinese history. It's gotta be. I mean, there were tons of blonde and redheads in China's old times, right?
It's not just this anime though. Every show, including live action dramas, will have this disclaimer. You even see it sometimes in American TV dramas. Just that some shows hide it within the ending credits so it's not as obvious as this lol
Come on! There are people here who think you'd get arrested for sexually harassing a pillow case, so of course they'd have to tell people it's not real. @WrittenShadow it's actually Korean not Chinese though.
Are you telling me this anime based in a manga is not really based in true events?!!! Oh my, and here i was thinking i finally will learn some true history, lol, anyway thx for the disclaimer
This anime is finally finding its groove, better by the week.
But riddle me this, how does a story that moves so slowly, consume the 20 minutes or so that we get each week so quickly? It must be a loophole in the time space continuum that anime has discovered and exploits to the fullest!
I was wondering the same thing jlmarc.
You know i happened to experience this same phenomenon with other animes,, maybe japanese studios knows how to control time?!
Korean studio isn't it?
Hak x Yona or we riot.
omg their ship name could be Yak @.@ *shipping intensifies*
or Yoku. >w<
Or Hana? Because, really, I don't want to imagine them as an animal every time I say/think of their ship name...
Why is the BGM so frickin' loud?
They messed up something during the stereo mixing, it happened in the previous episode too. I suspect the show is being aired in Japan using surround sound or something similar, while Crunchyroll uses stereo (unless I'm mistaken).

Its loud because the studio screwed up. Most shows are mixed in surround and its just consolidated to stereo (since most people use stereo systems). You need a surround receiver to actually decode the file to even get the surround channels.
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.
I swear, the Wind Clan is just so Freaking loveable!! <3
I would love to be with a sexy, cool, wonderful, strong, courageous man like Hak! There should be one in rl!! WHY ISN'T THERE?!
There is! You just haven't met me yet
I laughed so hard I had tears!
If only you didn't include "sexy," I might have fit the bill. Oh well.
It's rare for you to offer me such good sake. This is from your prized sake cellar. You're awesome Hak.
Best show this season <3
Best name I've seen today.
Genius
Yona of the Dawn It kind of sounds like one of the zombie movie
What about "Dawn of the Yona"?
Is it me or is the soundtrack volume ridiculously high? I can sometimes barely hear what they are saying
I agree it's blaring! Nice music but too, too loud.
Hak's people are GOOD people!!

"Are you being serious?" Tae-jun's attendant is the best.
40 minute episodes, for real. This went by way too fast
its a good show but i bet it wont sell high in japan which sucks..
Yona would make an interesting wife
Indeed.
You mean Waifu
