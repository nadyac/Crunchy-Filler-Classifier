This anime might get sued for revealing the ingredients of Mcdonald's burgers
thats scary
I actually started to cry when he started srinking the cola, i'm like (Sob) "I'm so happy for you kon!"
i cried too T.T
it's often best not to know just what goes into the food you eat if you are easily affected by that knowledge. just enjoy the end result.
i know how the food i've eaten so far was made and what the base ingredients in it is, i've even helped make it, like meatballs, hamburger and Jellied veal, the homemade Jellied veal my granny used to make before the dementia was amazing
For all that this show isn't, it certainly is well written and well voiced. And entertaining: it is very entertaining.
Agreed. If people are looking for plot, they really should look elsewhere. If they don't like crude humor, and constant nut jokes, again they should look elsewhere. I actually find this show more entertaining than most people.
Totally, it's actually much smarter than it appears to be. Gintama aside, what other shows juxtapose Japanese geekdom with Western ideology?
"COME BACK HERE INGREDIENTS!" her eyes were red!!! XD
This entire series is just one big joke . . . . and I love that about it.
unforturnately, the "big hamburger meal" in our world is made out of pretty much the same ingredients XD
I am amazed that marian was able to copy cola and a hamburger!!!
the volleyball conversations are hilarious and what was in that book Kon had?? I must know! lol xD
probably hentai...
he sees a bit of porn and then he's sat playing Street Fighter lol
damn he is good at widdling
awww thats so nice they took care of him like that and tried to help
So that's what Erec's soldiers do when no one's around. Who woulda thought? And gotta laugh at the hamburger scene lol.
Now we know what goes on in a McDonald's kitchen! LOL
You know you play too many games and watch anime when you..
