At least her cell phone didn't get wet... Heartseed logic time ._.
Ehh i Wonder who her really is. It did't tell right.....
Shoved? You bitch slapped her with an entire book bag!
LOL This made my day

Yeah, not to mention that because of that she was "shoved" into the corner of a metal cabinet with her head taking the impact
They did a really good job of making it seem like less than it was... she had to have taken some hefty damage.
How the fuck did he even hit her that hard with a book bag?
I can't help but wonder if Inaba is going to turn out to be a much more important character than we've been led to believe thus far.
i sure hope so! shes a boss
What does "than we've been led to believe" mean? She's pretty much the female protagonist of the series. The ending is dedicated to her!
Hey, uh, TennerForPetrol? Could you possibly, well, uh, Spoiler that? I didn't mind, and am not offended, but others might be. Thanks!
He meant that the credits animation/song at the end of the episodes are all Inaba, no need to spoiler that.
Nice to see drama in anime without people having to get killed in the process.
Yeah school days you should watch that anime...
Myself, Yourself was also pretty good too...
Omg, I just finished school days. Started out innocent and romantic... then turned into a bloody horror. Was frustrating!!!

@HauAreWe, spoiler alert much?
When are we going to get to learn more about Taichi and Aoki? I'd like to see both the male and female characters be developed. It feels like we're still just scratching the surface with them.

Fujishima turns out to be a character with some real substance! Who would've guessed that after the first episode?

Don't judge a book by its yuri-rape cover.
You gotta love his little sister. She actually gave him good advice, even though he's forever alone.
Sorry i kind of lost here. What do you mean by "forever alone"...? I mean he have 4 best friends.
Feels...... are breaking through!!!!! Must.... hold back.... FEELS!
Oh no! Your desires are being unleashed!
So the happy couple falls into domestic violence already. Me, I'll take Fujishima x Inaba. Doesn't Mr. Manipulator like yuri?
The teacher's not too bad when he doesn't have heartseed taking over
What about Inaba?? Ugh! Taichi! She basically emits an aura that says, "please, save me." I still feel like she is so left out. Also, I should just stop watching previews. It makes my wait for the next episode feel even longer.
Well she is also pushing the group away from her at every opportunity. It's hard to know where to focus their concern because they're all hurting... they just assume Inaba can handle it the best (even when it'd be hard on anyone) :/
ohhh ya! another episode of such a great anime!!!
lol this shiz is soo deep
ii thought it was interesting how they made a selfless person into someone you cant really like for this episode(maybe just me). Mr Go is awesome! he gives good advice
not much happened but I like Fujishima more
Am I the only one that wants to see Inaba and Taichi get together rather than him and Iori? :/
missionary of love?! does that have anything to do with missionary position XD
