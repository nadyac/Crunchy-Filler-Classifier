I think the most frustrating thing about this story ark is Carla not feeling the need to share her visions.
She's afraid of misunderstanding and causing the vision. Remember when she though she was some kind of dragon Slayer killing Agent because of her visions? If she hadn't believed the vision she would have never heard the lie.
the most frustrating thing is Number One somehow not realizing that Kagura wants to fight Erza
@Enigmal Thats because she didnt know that Kagura knows Jellal is in fairy tail or she would have calculated for that revenge
Would Carla start sharing her visions already!!
FREED IS A MEANIE
The First Master definitely wasn't crying. She was just another victim of those onion cutting ninjas. They're everywhere. On another note, you're a clod Freed.
"I-Im not crying! I'm not crying at all..." i'm just sad because i'm going to have to wait for next weeks episode.

Awww! I volunteer to give Mavis a biiiig hug to cheer her up
I'm actually one of those onion ninjas. If you only knew how many onions I peeled and cut into dice yesterday. You'd cry simply at the thought of it. As a side note, I don't cry when cutting onions. Therefore, it's the best profession.


And people complain about too many Jellal's. >_>" Bwhaha
@axlorg89, you can have mirajane... I'd rather not be with someone who can turn into Satan....
No love for Levy? that's who i would pick. Maybe Laki, the one with purple-ish hair and glasses, but she doesnt get much air time to know the character.
I'd like more Jellals >.>
I think Fernandez is the best of the three Jellals.
An eternal loli cried...someone needs to be punished

That means its tickle time!
Bring out the Comfy Chair!!!!!! = )
death to the traitor!!!
He has to peel and cut 10,000 onions.
We have No Game No Life and now Fairy Tail mindfucking us. THIS IS MADNESS!
Magic.
Ones from the future... they already said so...
Not really.... Fairy Tail only has me curious, we have enough pieces of the puzzle. No game no life blind sided us with that mind fuck. I'm running out of hair I can't handle the anxiety!!!
@zgaradude17 don't go bald on us LOL
JUST ONE MORE DAY FOR NO GAME NO LIFE, WE CAN DO THIS GUYS!!!

Juvia vs Cheria is funny epic!
Thank you Hiro Mashima for making Erza the most epic, badass, awesome female character in the history anime ever! You are amazing!!!
medaka box gets a huge recommendation from me all reading this go watch it

Medaka Box starts slow though. It isn't till near the end of season 1 that it hits epic.
You might want to read it instead of watching it.
Did I just find a conversation about epic, badass female characters where Black Lagoon wasn't brought up?
Is it safe to say that SHIT GOT REAL? SHIT GOT REAL.
gotta love a threesome battle :3
yea a threesome with erza and minerva would be splendid lol
There has been SO much mindfuckery this week between this, HxH and No Game No Life.
Oh heck yes, still gotta love it though
i wonder how many expected THAT person =P

I already knew who it would be from the blatant foreshadowing, camera constantly panning to dem flip-flops.
I thought it would be another Zeref... Zerefette.
Almogpas, best comment by far xD

Ah silly Natsu, that's what you get for rushing without thinking. Classic XD
A "3 way battle"? giggity goooooo
When is Charla gonna start sharing those damn visions?? I mean come on!! they are always true!!
The future Lucy is probably gonna yell at her for it, or should.
This episode went way too fast. >.<
M4RQXHFTEEV
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 8 EPISODES TO HAPPEN!!! YEAH I AM SHOUTING BECAUSE IT"S SO GOOD!!!!
I already changed my pic once. At this rate, it might not last the month.
Charlotte should really talk to people about the visions she has
I think she told someone, i forgot who but her readings aren't very clear. Also it's Charle, I thought it was Charlotte at first aswell :3
I think it was the old lady that cure her, the dragon if I'm not wrong...
Edolas version of their Sky Dragon.
Assuming you're referring to Grandine. I agree, though. It's infuriating to have her sitting on this potentially useful nugget of information and do nothing with it. I mean, everyone already knows she has visions, so why not share?
"it's...unpredictable" Well not unless you've seen the opening First
Mavis needs a hug. Or maybe a lolipop even though she's older than all of us combined here. I can't help it though. She's just way too damn cute.
This is getting even more interesting... but it sucks having to wait a whole other week for the next episode. :c

I hate waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish they could release more then one at a time!!!
