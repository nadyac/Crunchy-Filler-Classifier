Sojiro's story was very heart-breaking to me T^T
yeah the little guy is crying for help with none to be found truly sad.
He had a horrible childhood, sadly even though this is fiction, many things that happened to him aren't far away from reality for many children.

Too true. Anyone who witnessed or felt what Kenshin and Sojiro did would most likely go insane and either kill themselves or kill other people. Sojiro had the signature, tortureous past of your average serial killer, and so did Kenshin.
A lot of anime feature characters that were abused as kids by irresponsible adults... it's an interesting trend to think about
Most people would be surprised by how many children are abused in various ways every day, all over the world. That's why stories like Sojiro's are so believable.
I disliked Sojiro so much before. After seeing this though. T^T
To me personally the Rurouni Kenshin anime series has been my all time favourite anime and will be forever. But i must say that the episodes encompassing Kenshin and Sojiro's spar/duel is what i think of as epic anime that you rarely see.

Kenshin and Sojiro's past is so eerily similar. The only difference were how they were treated: one with tender love and care from others, the other born from hatred and oppression.
Have you read the manga? For Kenshin, he did receive care and love, but not in the way you think.
Yeah, the people who picked him up. The women in that travelling group shielded him and begged to spare Kenshin who was called Shinta that time till his master found him and helped him out.
So it's like a Kenshin gone wrong.
This show just keeps getting better
