I just realized how inferior my life is compared to clothes pins...
Oh my god! i cant stop laughing! SO.. RANDOM..

lol i laughed so hard at this
Clothes Pines can fix anything and everything, call on them in your times of need....
SO FUCKING VERSATILE!
To tie instrument strings.. to play a song. Wow.. even their names have really deep meanings. I love this anime.
Most authors will do that as well. There's places to look up the meaning of names if you want a person's name to mean something specific, and many have different languages.
I write and each character, everything they do and say means something.
Chop Chop Chop Chop
Crazy for you
So yaoi man. But still bromance all the way!
yaoi ofcourse
I'm glad some people still know what bromance means, that word is kinda special to me. (Btw I don't swing that way...)
They're my brotp
I'll ship a bromance any day.
ugh this anime is funny as shit but it can be so unrelentingly sad too, poor girl
Finally a part Otonashi's past is reveal.
oh man. one guy thinks hes christ, and nobody will listen to him. now we got "god", who again is ignored. lol. i like this series.
All their comments. They are hilarious. The foolish girl. The english man. The God boy.
And Christ.
& Shina even manages to say "How Foolish" LMAO
the ads cut into the sad parts D: damn it while i started crying i hear ALL I DID WAS EAT A BANANA ONE BANANA D: the hell man
Wait...if Kanade is there....then...who is that on the building!?
onions.....
kanade voiced by kana hanazawa. yee
@nerrage, they could do what Hulu sometimes does, and give you an option to have a 1:30 ad at the beginning instead of a few 30 second ads in the middle, so that you can play the whole video at one time yet still help the site.

Oh my God. My heart is exploding from sadness. The feels are tearing me apart.
SO MANY FEEEEEEELINGS!
oh shit wth just happened.
I wonder if TK is the epitome of what Japanese people view Americans as. xD
omg hahaha thats a funny way to look at it!
Otonashi's flashback felt like an entire episode. I have a lot of respect for him. Even after his sister died, he kept on moving forward. Too bad his life was ended so earlier.... All these characters have a lot of regret, huh?
At first, I thought he inadvertently killed his sister by taking her out of the hospital...
The player froze when Hitori was getting a stare-down so I ended up watching that for a good minute.
i like how all the guys were hiding behind that girls
From Laughing, to crying, to being mind fucked. How does it do it all in twenty minutes?
i am really glad i started watching this, thanks shinji for bringing this to CR
Clothes Pins, CLOTHES PINS!, CLOOOOOOTHES PIIIIIINNNS !!!! AAHHHHHHHHH
IM SUCH A FAILURE COMPARED TO THEM! NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! (Am I the only one who wants to comment on the whole '2 Angel' thingy?)
Amazing how ~8 minutes can be so emotionally devastating.
