If you ask me, the darkest part was that the "cute tagalong kid" insisted on chasing his dad...and directly led to his father being killed right in front of him. Actual consequences of the worst kind.
Wow I was NOT expecting the way this episode turned out...
Yo it shook my soul too!!!! I still held my chest throughout the ending!!

Or he could have just picked it up later. Dead means no more money either way.

^^ Certain episodes were animated long before the reboot of the Kaito Kid series, sometimes as Conan specials/OVAs
How far will a father go for his son....
Poor kid, and no not Kid kid kenta kid >-> <-< >->
Shit man that sucked. I mean it was good but that hurt.
The next episode better make up for this episode of feels!!!
Chuck Connery huh? Does he have a cousin named Chuck Connors or a brother named Sean?
Or Curt.
He has a brother Sean and cousin Chuck. : )


I always save this show for last so that I can just kick back and enjoy some fun magic goodness but this week, I got this episode instead. Was not expecting it to get this sad.
Damn reason I see this last on Saturdays is to end my viewing with some good vibes not this week
Damn, I just took a feels trip
to make up for this sad episode CS66EP99HLL I want to adopt the son
And yet people still don't think this show is underrated pfffft lol.
Now THAT felt like an episode of Conan.
I've thought this for a while, but is it just more or is this new opener AWESOME and TOTALLY not fitting to the anime?
Is his name Jack or Chuck?
That shit was good
Did not expect it to end like that. Poor Kenta.
