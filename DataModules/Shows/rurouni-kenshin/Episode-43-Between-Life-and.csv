There can be only one...
um wrong show lol highlander is stage exit right.
dang. only one master at one time...
His childhood memory is just a glimpse about how "cool" the war is... if you can watch the OVA it explains a lot more, but yes, his life was always hard.
Oh...kay. That really sucked in badass sorta way.
Dang... I'm literally sad right now...
God, reminds me of how epic the OVA was.
yep, agree
Yeah that's pretty sad but I really wonder just how destructive it would be if he used the bladed side.
Thats what i was thinking it can kill even with a reverse blade thats a crazy strong attack that it is.

A blunted blade is no different from a mace or a warhammer. It can put broken ribs through lungs, cause internal bleeding, cause heart arrhythmia, swell a larynx shut or split a skull just fine. A wooden sword can kill.
That whale sound in the ED song returns
I love this series. If anyone studies swordsmanship, they'd know that Kenshin risks his life every time he draws that sakabatou. That he manages to win with that slow blade is a testament to his god-like speed.
people's reactions are gonna be funny the next epi.. I have a feeling.. XD

So sad
Only Kenshin could kill brutally with a sakabatou! x)
I guess followers of the Hiten Mitsurugi style are Sith Lords with that whole rule of two/apprentice beats master thing.
Holy crap, The Fourth Avenue Cafe only lasted a few episodes..
Why do they keep playing graduation music at all the wrong times
oh noes

Oh my Jesus Christ how sad was that though. I'll watch that soooo many times and always shed a tear..... Or few.......
The way he uses that sword .. it's like a light-weight mace. No wonder that happened ..
