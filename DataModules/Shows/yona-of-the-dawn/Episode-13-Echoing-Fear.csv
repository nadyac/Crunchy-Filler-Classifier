Finally the comments section is back. It makes me sad thinking of all the Fire Nation jokes I've probably missed.

Thank you! I'll have to return the favor someday! ^_^
Sorry what are theses codes for?
I really want to know too - -
I do believe they're for watching the latest episodes. But I'm not 100% on that.
The Curse of the Blue Dragon - to be surrounded by stupid, superstitious, cruel villagers who keep you in the dark without human contact & prevent you from living anything resembling a normal life!!
I found too many similarities between that and my own situation..
I don't want to be annoyed, so I'll be careful. Poor Hak.
poor hak so sad
Curse that Blue Dragon for disabling the comments!
It's ALL HIS FAULT! right?
He definitely looked at the comments without his mask on..... =.= Poor guy
Blue Dragon blinded all the comments! What else could he do with those cursed eyes!?
Man the blue dragon is such a cutie
Omg, his face is gorgeous, those eyeeees *_*
Girl....its more than his eyes that are breathtaking...
He named the squirrel Ao. If you listen closely, you can hear the sound of my heart breaking (TTATT)
I hope that Yona gives the Blue Dragon and his pet new names to call their own. The Blue Dragon looks so lonely, lost and sad that I want to give him a big hug! \(>.<)/
What I've seen thus far for Winter has been disappointing, so a great holdover from last season is nice! But please announce a season two. I'm constantly paranoid we'll recruit the last dragon an episode or two before the finale.
They don't have a set number of episodes yet for the series.
^This series is set for a 2-cour. Unless a second season is announced, it will conclude at the end of the winter season.
No say it aint soooooooo ;(
I still want the next episode now, even after 13 episodes. That's great storytelling, right there...
Don't worry Hak, I'm rooting for you so hard.
The blue dragon is so gorgeous.
I absolutely adore this series! Hope it's getting lots of of love in Japan! When we can get it I will be buying the mangas, DVDs - maybe even keychains and t-shirts & and leave it all to our library or someone I really love lots.

LOL so true
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy. She'll beat you if she's able. You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Ow, that hurt..
I LOVE this show!!!! its fantastic!

She's such a player.
This anime has a great Opening... I can never skip it.
