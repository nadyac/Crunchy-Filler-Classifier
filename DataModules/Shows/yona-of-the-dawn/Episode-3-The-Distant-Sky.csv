Episode Summary: Hak is/has always been awesome.
Also, Grandpa gets in trouble and leaves, and Soo-Won makes a weird thing.
Hak will always be flawless
and sexy <3
he was cool and straightforward before it was cool! hakku kooru desu! :L
@AcePD your fucking profile pic made me laugh so hard i cried. Omg
King Il may have been too nice, but after grabbing that sword, he's definitely not a coward
at first i thought he just missed the handle and was like *oh shit shit shit! be cool be cool you're daughters wathching"
And the Father of the Year award goes to King Il. He might be a happy go lucky King who hates weapons, but that didnt stop him from grabbing the blade of sword with his bare hands to protect his daughter and not flinching. Much RESPECT.
I'm still thinking Il killed his brother because he killed Il's wife, but that's a good point that the brother may have attacked Il as well and given him no choice.
Yar. I think Soo-Won's father had Yona's mother assassinated, since he was secretly leading the insurrection. King Il probably didn't want it to be known that his brother lead said insurrection, so called it an "accident"
@vie-cool: At THIS point of the Series, I TOO hope that that's the case as well.

"This is my swamp, and she is my lily flower" said Hak the frog.
I hope Yona really falls in love with Hak....

ok I have to go read the manga now....see you next episode *leaves to read the manga*
Nope! Hak is mine! Lol
Childhood friends always win in a harem! (unless they kill your dad)
ERMERGERD
Damn those who said that the King was a coward... No fucks given even if he got his hand sliced...
Sliced? He friggin grabbed it on the blade!
Eat your heart out, Catelyn Stark.


I think before his dad died, Soon-won was really that cute little kid. At least, I want to believe that because the alternative is just too depressing. :'(

Me: Smashing that replay button
The king is a secrete badass. He just grab that sword like its nothing
In spite of everything, I really hope people understand that this series is about character growth fare more than romance. It's like ice cream, the story and characters are the scoop, the romance is the cherry.

tbh them focusing more on conflict and character growth is a major plus especially considering the era its set in. Slow burn romances are the best when its not the main focus, when it is it just drags.
Precious babies...
wtf xD
this episode is so adorable. hard to believe what Soo-won becomes.
No chipmunk though. That made me sad. And nothing says love like continuing eating your father's horrible porridge. It's the thought that counts.

I love this anime & the OP!!! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
Funimation just posted the first episode of this on their site for the US. Once again proving Crunchyroll is better then funimation as a streaming service.
I like funimation because they have the dubs of shows I like. Admittedly crunchyroll usually runs better.
Crunchyroll also have some hiccups with streaming titles. I'm still waiting for the rest of the episodes of encouragement of climb season 2, after crunchy only aired the first episode in July
I like Crunchy for the stable player and the fact that it's older titles aren't uploaded to Hulu like FUNI did, which made watching some of their stuff unbearable. (If I have a subscription to Plus I shouldn't have to see ads!)
Plus only lets you watch it on devices like your phone, tablet, or smart tv (plus a few tv shows). It has nothing to do with adds, get rid of plus and watch it on your computer if it bothers you paying for it. I like the fact there's a lot
There are also lots of great shows which air on FUNi but not here. I don't like to compare and contrast I just call them both great.
Man, is it just me or was the music mixed WAY too loud?
Yeah the sound balance has been odd, there's quiet talking moments where the background track forces itself into the foreground and drowns out what's happening.


I was thinking that King Il was hiding something from us, then I saw him stop a sword with his bare hand. 0_o Wow...
Major respect for the king.
Hak will probably be one of the best characters we get the privilege of seeing this fall(only to be rivaled by shinichi/migi), can't wait to see next week's ep! Lol and his "gramps" reminds me of Garp too!
So I wasn't the only one?! His interactions with Hak immediately reminded me of Garp and Luffy xD
