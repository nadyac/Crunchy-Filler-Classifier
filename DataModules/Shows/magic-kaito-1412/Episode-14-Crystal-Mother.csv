omg, he ruffied her, some one call the cops
Quick, someone get Inspector Nakamori! Oh wait, he's drunk.
Call the cops? They are drunk.
Dont drug your girlfriend. *No Aoko's were hurt in this animation.*
Well, at least he didn't...........................draw on her face.
Ha ha ha ha ha! SAO abridged! Ha hahahahahaha!
I'm really enjoying these, even if I've seen the Detective Conan version of it. Like the other episode, it shows more of what Kid is doing instead of Conan which is really cool. Hope by the end of this season they decide to make more.
detective conan version? you mean an episode of detective conan or the old magic kaito?
He just roofied aoko.
Another amazing Episode! :3 I love this series!
Nothing up the sleeve... Oh wait: YGV9DQNCT5V
3rd time's the charm? (Crystal Mother 3rd animated version). Shonen Sunday OVA (1st version) I still like best which integrated Conan into it.

Nope. It just had to be moonlight.
i wonder if both organizations from this and conan are the same one

Yeah, though I think Snake is supposed to be the Gin equivalent in Magic Kaito... it's not really clear if the organization looking for Pandora is the same BO that shrunk Kudo, so it could be the same org, or two diff orgs.
yea nothing like watching this ep for the third time
The new ED reminds me of the opening of AnoHana and makes me feel some feels
BASED Kaito
dat roofie colada tho
Man, Aoko's such a tsundere she can't even admit her honest feeling about wanting to see the Queen!
Sounded like he was rackin' a SAW when he cocked that pistol lol.
cat looks like a alien.
