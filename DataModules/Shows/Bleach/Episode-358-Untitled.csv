2:36 recap is over
that music when he activated his fullbring...i almost fell out my chair laughing XD
lmao ik what you mean out of all the the background songs they could have picked, NO! the soul sisters was fitting
I missed the wailing girls singing so much!!! You know it's gettin' real then LOL!!! Epic!
Ohhhhuuuuuwaaaaahoooooo! If ya wanna see some act-shun, gotta be the center OF A TRACT SHUN
Rofl. XD
its so hilariously out of place its funny
Tsukishima has got to be the biggest dick in Bleach history. I mean seriously.
but u gotta admit the way aizen haled those LOADS of wads and wads of lies out his ass was kinda impressive
He's the biggest successful Troll I've ever SEEN XD


Actually Mayuri is the biggest dick, in a funny way
there are just some problems that a face full of boobs can't solve.
There could not be a more false statement. Boobs are the solution to EVERY problem! Even mathematic problems.

it's so funny how Jackie says her fullbring..."DAATY BOODS"
Doesn't Ginjo remind anyone else of the guy who was the leader of the Bounts way back in that arc?
Kariya? Not really.
It's because of those eyebrows xD
And the unusually-placed vertical scar, maybe?
Man, I missed the old cheesy fight music...
Havent heard that music around 9:35ish in a while xD lol
Great. Now Ichigo is a Human/Hollow/Fullbringer. Now all we need is Ichigo to graduate from Shinigami school and become a true Shinigami and he'll be a Shinigami/Human/Hollow/Fullbringer.
don't forget vizared



This is stupid. All he had to do was say he needed to have a word with his 'cousin' outside, use his fullbring, kill that poser and all would be well.
boobies always make me feel calm too
Really? They seem to get me excited!
Not if they're a motherly figure's.
if only we could fast-forward existence to get to the next episode lol
i can't wait till rukia comes in
Damn, thats sooo f'ed up!!! Man I was feeling as helpless as Ichigo!! *mind blown* Ginjo and Ichigo cant trust anyone lol
LOL WHY THE PERSON BELOW ME HEAD SHAPE LIKE THAT:(Bart Simpson lol
This is the best episode in arc so far!
I have to admit, that Tsuki is one of the scariest enemies. He doesn't necessarily feel overwhelmingly powerful like Aizen, but more like psychologically superior. He's playing everybody like saps. Even Uryu can't make sense of it all.
ive never wanted ichigo to kill someone as much as right now.....
....Woa. My mind just imploded.
And where the hell is Isshin?
