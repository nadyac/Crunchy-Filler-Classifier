shirt instructor hugged him too best part ggo kawaii~ banzai japanese cheer can translates longlife hurrah usually repeated three times express enthusiasm celebrate victory applause favor happy

soul witch doesnt soul cause hes robo skeleton dude im sorry just trying pun something up here totally backfired like gun ugh whatever feel cheated week lets just all hope mothers rosario going amazing well least not an 80 minute recap timejust saying well two seasons recapped last time maybe theres some foreign country where wont shown until season after sixth month gap whatever otherwise makes no sense although grenade hug did deserve replay least its not endless so many explainer episodes season dont really need recap episode sucked just wanted more story nit recap shinkawa kyouji really craving some asadasan should definitely get burrito digital recorders japan remember last episode also about half recap starting recap every episode plus all flashbacks were lucky got 12

trying like girly deidara showed opening previous episodes like yeah no summary but then leave sao troll tho nice see all started conflicted sinon ended lovely sinon agree but lest called episode 145 so kind expected episode title but thought debriefing would like an explanation next missionplot recap wouldve better title debriefing an explanation what happened mission one just returned an explanation next missionplot would simply briefing so ends first arc an amazing journey am sad over but comforting know another arc look forward lets hope amazing first sigh hoping going new episode nope just debrief answer some questions first sao started web series wassnt compiled into lns till later secondthere about two arcs away where ln but latest arc super long thirdi think next episode might cont one filler stories no spoiler kind like lizbets silicas stories fourth check out bakatsuki still sao ln heard were going delete theirs official trans publ came out outrun sub translated do official ones but taking ever release then english way johnny talking hard tell its actually filler next episode really filler something wasnt included mangaoriginal iteration piece work typically extend anime airings recaps nice but why must replace an episode yeah isnt replacing anything will still 24 episodes think its obvious point being made here no new episode week doesnt think its taking away an episode series producer also already stated air dates 15 were pushed back anyways without 145 reason why its 145 instead 15 bud ive never seen someone explode after being cut into pieces probably michael bay did some shit japan sinon just killed man put gun against his head pulled her trigger now hes dead sinon life just begun but youre most welcome kiritos harem nice subtle exxxxcariburrrr fools many volumes sword art online manga called something different well 14 light novels japan but so far yen press gotton translated more way manga adaptation same name scratch 14 make 15 coughcaliber more fillerimo cough check out bakatsuki fan translations hasnt taken down due official ones release actually really legit taptaptaptaptapdotnet up novel 11 kindle but beaned not complete novels yet 12 up recap wasnt too bad dont get why people complaining sure its recap meaning an episode lost but hey showed all sinon badass moments cute grenade hug suicide any sinon fan would dig your assumption everyone sinon fan dont dislike her can accept recap episodes but some clips picked didnt work well own ended up underscoring some downsides show no episode lost baka its nice dont lose episode but wait one week next one its filler recap no one ever likes filler not ova not side plot doubly no one likes recap so no one likes episode want relive an epi can go find epi nonetheless sometimes put import shit end next episode release delayed heresarecapoftheeventssofarenjoyitorskipitifyouplease~ would rather just given nothing maybe would remembering tv show japan people can miss episodes dont understand why people up arms over episode title debriefing fact episode made painfully clear wasnt real episode people need learn observation skills memory amazing pale rider little screen time only due your elitism being too much would outshine kirito rip good thing recapped almost forgot what happened one episode ago well recap episode least present grennade scene will always make day really did any one else notice poor sub shinon says butiwrong 2103 swear were no recap flashback episodes all anime would total 100 episodes across all anime youve clearly not heard naruto bleach alone must contribute 95% all anime episodes existence id say filler about 10% anime 3050% more like american tv one reasons dont watch crap clearly making an over exaggerated joke guess some people didnt get like says naruto bleach make up 95% all anime episodes anime run longer than either no gintama one piece both ran longer than bleach probably naruto but dont care much
