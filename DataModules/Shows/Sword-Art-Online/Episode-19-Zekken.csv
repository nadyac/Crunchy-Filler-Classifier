@Titanic79 A big part of the reason Kirito went easy on Yuuki has to do with the "Totally living in this world" comment. Kirito is the only one who figured out Yuuki's situation just from fighting her. Had he been serious, he would've won.
@bipolarguy07, I totally agree. Also, he was NOT desperate to win, and it just wouldn't be fair if he used dual sword skills or excalibur against Yuuki(who only had a one-handed sword).
well I guess we'll find out in 11 hours
Can't build a proper harem if you choose winning over over being a gentleman.
and the truth comes out

@jacksonbarber49 : To be fair, their first choice wasn't a mass murderer. He was "just" guilty of kidnapping, forcible confinement, human experimentation - to develop memory/personality altering tech so he could sell it, and alter Asuna.
@ jacksonbarber: But her parents didn't know any of that. They actually knew him from when he was a small child growing up with Asuna, as her childhood friend. He took advantage of this because he wanted to inherit the company from her dad.
I really enjoyed this show until Asuna's mother showed up. Now I can't watch it. My own parents are way too close to the character here, and it hurts
When Sugou came up, Asuna's mother's response was essentially, "I didn't pick him, but this time, I swear this guy's not a kidnapper and rapist!" The fact that she loses her composure seems to indicate Asuna hit a sore spot.
With a rapier!
This Arc has got to be my favorite when comes to Asuna, no other Arc got into the Character Development quite like this one did, I feel you get to see a whole nother side of Asuna that we haven't gotten to see till now. Go Asuna ;D
communicate her true feelings with them. This is a problem that goes both ways. Her mother sat, waiting, for her daughter, to eat dinner. She really is trying, but Asuna does not seem to make an effort to say what's really on her mind.
Hopefully, they'll have a real heart to heart talk. I think that will clear a lot of things up between them, and it will help her parents truly understand that Asuna is not the same person they knew before. But she needs to say something.
Apologies for the essay.
I really don't expect that her parents will budge when she communicates her mind. Her parents see only a child, but the blissful hell that was SAO added 5-10 years worth of intense life-experience to Asuna.
I felt Aincrad was the best arc because of the new relation ship between Asuna and Kirito.
How to par someone Asuna style: Make a remark about how angry they were (her mum) for not been born into a rich family, then leave by closing the door quietly with grace while they are left feeling burned calling your name
@CluelessProgram you also forgot stalking and that weird fetish with smelling hair... how da hell is chilled services not in the pitcher right now or at lest a restraining order for that freek??
@super_ray : Best guess? Sugou's in prison, and not enjoying himself. Asuna's family would want him to suffer. Plus he'd be a convenient stand-in target for anyone who hated Kayaba, and the fact that Kayaba was never arrested/tried/ect..
they found Kayaba dead in his secret residence and arrested his wife who was keeping him alive through out SAO
@JCossey : Kayaba was never captured, and he chose to die as he did. For some, his death (no matter the circumstances) would bring closure. But not for others. (And if the general public knew what Kirito does...). Also, GF, not wife.
@sugar_ray : As to why Sugou got away with things for so long? (IMO.) His family was friends with Asuna's family. He was a good actor (when he chose to hide his true nature). And he was smart (but not as smart as he thought he was).
Nothing beats that proud look on Kiritos face when Asuna finally goes into her top gear....

I love how Asuna told her mom straight out how she is embarrass of her parents for being poor. her mother should know just because she married into a rich family that she shouldn't forget where she came from. the battle was awesome
Her mother is just a gold digger. All she cares about is money and Asuna just reminded her mother where she came from. Also Asuna has more back bone then her mother because her mother is a leech who only loves money not family.
Seems to me people simply do not understand the culture. There is still a lot of linearity from high school on. Your schools really do determine a lot about your opportunities there and arranged marragies are still not uncommon.
Some of us understand to some extent that that stuff is commonplace & accepted in some countries. But that doesn't have to stop us from voicing or rather typing our opinions.

my family has had arranged marriages every generation up until mine, and they're trying to push it on me too! Appearantly it's about LEARNING to love this other person, and it sounds crazy but my grandparents were together 50 years!
That opening ... Its... just.... Damn. This is going to be an amazing arc!
@Eruanion, Yuuki would totally go lesbian for Asuna. She perfers her WAY more than Kirito. That's all I'll say.
After hanging out with Yuuki, Asuna tells her mom: "I'm not into men anymore :P"
Yuuki Asuna.....
I like they way they gradually transitioned away from the excaliber side story opening this wee and last, nice storyboarding/direction.
It'll be funny if Asuna goes lesbian with Yuuki

Kirito didn't pull out Excalibur, so he didn't go all out then. He might think: "Only noobs go all out for a one handed skill. I'm a dual wielding pro with a Best in Slot sword, I don't need that little skill :P".




Gosh damn it, this arc is gonna kill me T.T
You can change it, just upvote & it changes. It's happen to me a few times because of my tablet's touchscreen.
Thanks, Matt784. I have now up-votted Rena-Ryuguu's (original) comment.
Any time, It also works if you need to give a different star rating to a show.
Will the next episode be based on the manga during the arc or what? I'm really curious to see how spot on it will be
For the most part the anime has been spot on with the Light Novel (not manga) the biggest deviation has been the harem feeling.
That was f***ing satisfying...

Yeah, I put that on my bookmarks bar. XD

Proves that money can't buy you happiness. Not forever that is.
Asuna's mother clearly cares for her daughter which is why she's a bitch but with that said...she's still a bitch.
If I had a daughter I would love them to have someone like Kirito,
I also think it's really ungrateful for her mom to dismiss Kirito considering that he got Asuna away from that creepy quasi-fiance who was secretly imprisoning her.
@mobiusklein Kirito doesn't have an established family name, which is still very important in Japan even today.

Me too
Trying to get Asuna to marry someone else is like trying to light fire with water.
not if the guy is kirito lol
Someone please give Asuna's mother a bitch slap
True enough, RX-0Unicorn. And even in modern "western" societies, (yes, even the US) things like your family background can make difference. But Asuna's parents already proved they can be fooled (Butterfly-boy).
Plus, at least Asuna's mother, seems determined to forget/ignore that Asuna spent two years in SAO, and a few months as a prisoner in the original ALO. Over a tenth of Asuna's life has been spent risking her life or death of personality.
well, asuna pays her back later....

RX-0Unicorn so what? Slavery existed for many generations (and still does in a sexual form), but you wouldn't say that's good, right? Why do you think Japan has one of the highest youth-suicide rates? Being common doesn't make it right.
I've read the novel and man the feels are already kicking in!
It's pretty obvious where the season is gunna end isn't it?
This was perhaps the least enjoyable arc for me. Of course Alicization will need a couple seasons by itself, so it is understandable they are trying to fill out the remainder of this season without really getting into anything substantial.
Alicization will be the best. because it some much more like a standard RPG it will be good! cant wait!
I refuse to believe anyone is stronger then kirito sorry that's just my fan boying stronger then kirito NOPE NOPE NOPE

When I saw how Asuna's mother was behaving, how she was treating Asuna... It made me so angry...
had to get a new screen (keep a large quanitity of cheap replaceable screens in the cupboard) coz i punched the screen and cracked it
That must get really expensive
This feels like me and my parents, though mostly on grades.
That smile on Kirito's face. He calculated that if he lost against Zekken and had Asuna fight. Zekken would choose Asuna and they go on their merry adventure. While Kirito can make up lost time with Sinon, Lisbeth and Silica.
