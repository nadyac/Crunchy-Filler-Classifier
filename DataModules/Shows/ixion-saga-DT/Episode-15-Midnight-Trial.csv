your destiny is... I pooped my self. LOL
That was some funny shit...... ha ha
yes.. DT is singing the opening now.
I liked the first person that was singing it at first...hahaha
The first one to sing it was Variation, so with my universal headphones, I successfully synced them and it sounded like the best duet opening EVER!!!!!!!!
^^^ That was the best idea ever.took me a few tries but I got it :DD
the freaks come out at night.
I love the princesses facial expression lol..."Tha fuck you want" pops up in my head
Kon is truly, truly clueless. I'm pretty sure even the princess knows what they're up to and Kon couldn't figure it out after he saw them.
At least the capital is big enough to hold all that diversity

LMAO at all the "What is this (insert well known title here)'s"
I prefer Kon singing the opening.
Like how it takes Kon's group like months to go as far as it takes 1 of the enemy people to go in less then a episode.
Thats probably just because they have to lay low
having to take detours and stuff to lay low, would make a trip somewhere take longer then it should
Don't question anime logic; it is not understandable
Doesn't seem like laying low was achieved in all honesty.
Lmao gotta like those underground Anti groups
if i got a quarter every time i see a floating city in anime...
you still would only have one quarter....
Count SAO then you have two quarters
there is the other earth place in fairy tail
4th quarter from the original reference, Castle in the Sky.
Umm ok this series just keeps getting stranger and stranger.
love the new ending !!!
capital is sure lively at night
seeing the princess smiling in the end credits sure was a positive change for me.
Y'know, I somehow get the feeling Sangeleine & Marian are hiding something. Almost like they were up to something the previous night. I wonder what it could be.

The new ending was pretty cool but i miss the old one...
im a fan of both
Yeah muscles and pets ftw
I'm at that part and I'm thinking, "Hang on, is that Sangeleine?".
i actually like the new ending.
OMG!!!!!! This show is just too dang fun! Now what was it's name? LOL
