"I don't remember giving birth to such ugly children." Aw, she reminds me of my mom. :')
Best, Female Pirate, EVER!
My favorite scene ever!
well then must be tough cookies then. at lest ur mom doesn't make you eat burnt cookies - w -
For some reason she reminded me, in her entrance, of the manager/grandmother from Hanasaku Iroha... Maybe it's her cool, no nonsense demeanor. That or the pipe.
YEAH, she reminded me of the grandmother too.
At the end when Hak shakes xD
ughhhh..
Poor Hawk. Like the princess doesn't give him enough trouble--now he has a fan.

Awwww the Green Dragon has a man-crush on Hak. How cute.

"When you want to come to a place like this, just tell me. I didn't realise" I died almost, omg XD
There's also the fact that she was a sheltered princess up until now - I don't believe she quite understands the meaning behind "having fun with girls" at that establishment. I did hope she'd get a bit angry though - poor Hak.
I think it is because she's a sheltered princess that she knows full well that while she might be a virgin, that most likely both Hak and Soo-won are not. I could be wrong and she might think Hak just wants some G rated company.
I mean, she could have just assume the girls were like geisha or modern hosts and where strictly providing conversation and other cloths on entertainment. Certainly the place looked more like a drinking hole and not a brothel. *shrug*
Hak has always been hovering between friend/servant/father-figure zones... I don't think Yona has room in her book to push him to a love interest (^_^; )
Maybe she was thinking "You could have fun with me" hahahaha naaaaaah
OMG they're all so cute about seeing the ocean. Their expressssssssions!! <3
The seven wonders of the world
lol at the "goes without saying" response for the Shin-ah
Why can't the episodes be longer T-T
I feel that way for every episode
Why can't they come out more frequently, more like. Having to wait a week is rough.
That's what happens with every anime... except for like one piece. That's cuz there's like 600 episodes. I'm at 500 right now and on hiatus haha
I completely agree! I wait like 2 or 3 weeks thinking ill come back to a bunch of episodes only to realize the there are 2...
"Wow I haven't watch Yona and Co for like a month! I've got a lot of episodes to catch up on!" *1 hour later* "wait... 3 episodes...? THAT'S IT?!?!?!?!"
Man, Hak... "so perceptive," but he sits with a strong fighter with GREEN HAIR who disappears when the white dragon says the green dragon was just there, but he still doesn't realize that maybe, just maybe, that was the green dragon. Hmm...
@CortL Isn't there still one more after this? You might get your wish..
As anime fans, we have to accept the fact that anime characters will never find anything odd about another's hair color, no matter how improbable. Unless it's Yona's, apparently.
Naturally pink hair for the win! Let's see some natural purples, too!
Since 100 people liked my comment, I'll just hide this here... HREA38MQXDR JBTZF9H78M9 EGQZ49KDKZ8 MXS9XK5THM3 NHH954N5GN4 HNVJADTPEGL 8UDTN4BLHPY Happy viewing
I want a Black Dragon now, kinda like an Anti-Hero but not a Tsundere, I'm okay with a Black Dragon who is Obsessinve Yandere with a pinch of Possessive Yandere
Hak and the Green dragon are going to be great friends... I can feel it. ^_^
yona better watch out, if Kawaii Village Girl doesn't take Hak, Captain Baba will.
Captain Baba lmfao I died xD
It will be like Burato and Tatsumi from Akame ga Kill. Great buddies with one always wandering if he should be taking ten steps back to keep his innocence. Without the mentor aspect.
"Oh, he's crazy strong." "He's crazy strong and handsome, you'll like hi.." "Secure him immediately." I like this captain.
OH God, even the dragons want Hak. XD
I think everyone wants Hak at this point
Hak loves her so much, it's almost painful to watch.

I cringe every time he tells her she's burdensome, annoying, and has absolutely no appeal as a woman. Ouch! Of course, especially after Soo Won, she's going to believe it's how he sees her & is only there 'cause of her father's order.
I don't know, it seems to me like she realizes that he's just teasing her.
Yes, she's well acquainted with Hak's teasing. And in this kind of scenario, it proves to be "teasing out of kindness" (=you don't look so well, please get some rest), which I think comes across to Yona.
Omg! Finally Gigan arrives! Of course happy for Jaeha as well, but Gigan was my favorite side character in the translated scans so far. She's such a bad ass!

She is truly a strong woman.
Poor Hak got abused so much in this episode. I almost feel bad for laughing so much.
Yona and her beautiful eyes... I can't get enough.
I love how this anime goes from *serious* to *comedy* and then back to *serious* ... and it does so in a very natural way! XD
Just like, IMO, your lie in april. One moment I'm about to drop manly tears, next they throw a comedic scene at my face. My brains can't take this lol.
"Mom we love you!" "I don't remember giving birth to such ugly children." best pirates ever.
Reminds me of the pirates in Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. I love it!
If Hak/Yona doesn't work out there's always Hak/Jeaha. It was bromance at first sight!

The best way to enjoy this show is to ship all of the ships. Because they're all seriously adorable.
So true <3
Yet another great character, I freaking love everyone in this show, even the side characters are fun.
Jeaha gonna steal Hak away from you Yona lol
The shivers. I love them, wish we had them in real life... I would love to watch ppl shiver while I talk about them behind their backs. lol
