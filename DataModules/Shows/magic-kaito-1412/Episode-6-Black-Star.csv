OMG fma3323! what a spoiler!
Wait how is that a spoiler? .___. It's in the first couple episodes
Hahaha, that's really good + the way they unraveled his identity, good episode!!!
I think people have been a little confused since Crunchyroll started on the most recent episodes, so people just discovering the show are missing huge amounts of information :/
Very different from my normal shows, but really loving this series so far.

I want episode 7! Loving this show.
Great development in the show. i'm hooked.
