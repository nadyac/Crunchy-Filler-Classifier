kakashis full face instead doing what bungie did halo where give second see master chiefs face most major detail shadow camera only showed master chiefs eyes no hiding details shadow just under seconds beat game hardest setting so know mate bdays 24th june too started all bout march year off an nostalgiadamn its already 12 years feel so old hit retirement home plan holding up room streaming anime 247 since am 34 plenty time perfect jutsu getting tingles half episode eyes were prickling rest anime otaku life ill turning 20 soon started watching first came out english toonami im 25 whenever do get old feel like retirement homes nursing homes will filled computers gaming consoles ive grown up anime video gaming dont want bored just because im old these flashbacks dont piss off always wanted see kakashis point view finally next week get back main storyline some great stuff about come guarantee someone doesnt know by point its own fault its shown many times besides every episode here so theres no excuse not watch thought explained within manga remember reading somewhere hidden mist put three tails within her were chasing after her therefore being reason killed her shelia219 spoiler half spoiler someone already mentioned epsiode comment section kakashi helped sasuke trained chunin exam naruto lil jealous but thats bec kakashi feel more responsible teaching an uchiha than naruto sakura doesnt any sensei teach her chunin exam shes not useless dreading episode recap end turned out better then thought would right either second third time theyve retold portion story its probably best retelling yet nice see another appearance sakuras parents really missed obito being crushed by rock hmmm no really missed rock lol ok might cried bit one mee too but thats what love about anime dem feels 2stronk hands precious fallen comrades pushing him forward love tears feels nostalgia teared up bit too xd so without kakashi really wouldnt show here since taught never abandon your comrade thats why naruto so desperately trying get sasuke back third thought naruto would just another jiraya thought sharingan necessary help naruto control kurama but turns out sasuke one who needs help say never realized much an impact third hokage actually here think about chose team by hand knowing full well what doing set whole series motion whats weird swear originally said were chosen random why would tell someone choose specifically purpose would slow down even ruin any progress happen future were talking about who started everything think forgetting danzo created like every enemy naruto faced order become what now nostalgia episode will strong really amazing everyone squad seven changed since day back fourth great ninja war next week especially seeing naruto way episodes end compared where hes outro so cool ah yes good ol squad days kakashis life really changed met those brats hehe but better hes such an amazing sensei~ ending says all feels watching first comes crunchyroll totally worth staying up till 4am love show kind glad its 9pm wait all week just 20 minute episodeits torture wow interesting episode kind lined up weeks manga chapter end part kakashi talking obito rin made tearup next week back canon storyline exactly what thinking identical flashbackcontent what saw manga week doubt could timed better tried agree well timed least thats what said newsbite about kakashi anbu arc coincide naruto shippuden filler not still enjoyed every bit far filler arcs go definitely best only filler arc believe shouldve included manga fleshes out kakashi sooo much more thought first shippuden arcs were decent twelve guardian ninja arc soso threetails arc pretty good utakata arc favorite even third hokage thing sakura average thinks lol yeah literally just love interest spur rivalry who might develop into decentgood kunoichi classic third saw sakura another possible tsunade possibly third saw lovetriangle sakura infatuated sasuke naruto
