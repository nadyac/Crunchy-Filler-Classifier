seems like everyone hates david well except touko maybe hiro better watch out someone spoil school days only got episode writers school days said created story riposte harem comedies most harem comedies nobody gets hurt everyone lives happy lives real life heartbreak rejection awful consequences god thats exactly felt watching stopped bit before picked back up trial just finish oh man white albumthat guy school days by far most creepiest anime ive watched life weirdest bike chase scene ever seen little sister girl like rides by bike while wearing swimsuit tells stay attractive yeah think ill listen her wrong hoping him fall love her instead its not big an age difference during exchange japan met more parents 1015 years age difference than not so guess very normal sure an age difference because may just experiencing effect httpiimgurcomoyn10grpng some girl told attractive whilst jogging would probably loose footing run into pole bracing myself impact seemed inevitable must quite sidewalk not pole hydrant trashcan etc think might need change name show everybodyhatesdavid think found titan comments somewhere xdd reading comment suddenly made drama more realistic because some screwed up reasonit usually all happens way one person immature seems trickle down rest group what do jonathon rest coop think david saachi hate say but totally deserved mellorain well put hiro only normal one everyone hate david so much its changing personality sachi manipulative bitch yanagi mean bitch dont like female characters being portrayed show hope touko stays sweet everyone show glaring faults but what creates drama right everyone show perfect would pretty boringor yuri show everyone real life faults too seemingly perfect humans but usually twisted some way would boring well so did kiss not am only one who wanted see kiss well probably see later episode not alone think touka receives visions true real feelingsthoughts others so possible vision davids real feelings wanting kiss her think theyll kiss future thought her first kiss immediately thought okikura so guess sees feelings people close her after some actionemotion im pretty sure didnt kiss but suppose scene emphasis emotion way touko realizes david isnt just some robot no feelings but really does value having her around yuki should just move liking touko start his middle school girl harem go get em mr 530 guy gives him something look forward everyday but doesnt strike loli kon character mr 530 loli swim team totally salute ship honest looked his left saw all girls swim suits staring him would probably really scary xd free anything go by theyll kickass bodies another couple years xd so its davids fault yuki an jerk got turned down wont accept his girl likes another guy so takes out david everyone believes its david thats ruining everything its yukis immaturity sad yukis defence seems crushing touko sometime dont get over months emotions day plus yuki doing ok initially but then david started getting pulled into group lost bit overall deal seems little group over not being friends probably what yuki needs get over touko maybe hell develop feelings yanagi maybe wont but its clear leave friendship circle feel bad hiro yuki even though yuki crybaby ship david touko sachi can get turfed urgent care ward all care yana needs either leave start some fan service all imo course dont know its just but drama scenes feel so anticlimatic maybe these just teasers last big one well its not davids fault getting pulled into group david said himself no business anyone else but touko therefore doesnt want participate touko understands too explained but dont stop ithinkiwanttovisitjonathan all do touko jonathan all answers afterall think touko hears words sees true emotion behind only explains someone her visions though id second 51st suppose triggered david thought sohesfallingeh nudgenudgedaddywink interesting type special insight can wide range effects glimpses future being exceptionally perceptive literally seen world through other peoples eyes so can very unexpected unnerving times good theory cant relax all watching now feel like theres disaster looming around corner last vision gave hardcore chills ive hardcore visions before also can daaaamn scary mr 530 guy harem doesnt even know like most harme protags thats one inborn ability attract without knowing like kirito kirito knows harem just chooses ignore all other girls who arent asuna kiritos swordplay much more aggressive sinon though cant say blame him hes got rentaro special harem atm feel like ill go back rewatch show beginning once its over really understand what heck actually happening each episode good show regardless dont get wrong haha downintoukotown lmao made night dont know lesbian her attention adolescent friendships can intense even crushing hasnt anyone felt sense loss friend started dating hiros face turning away said going home can just see every ounce his disappointment sachi its amazing much facial expressions alone can say about something said boyfriend oddly not kareshi boy friend can also mean boyspacefriend not couple next time girlfriends mom says im her boyfriend will say thats mr boyfriend agree unrequited lovers heart goes out hiro most poor hiro hes such sweetie too t~t him id less stunned yandere sacchi touko more concerned easily manipulated him her own ends prpobably best episode so far things getting more exciting but just want know whats up kakeru his clones maybe schizophrenia love his self thoughts represented by several him cool sometimes just need an imaginary version yourself argue find your real feelings matter think real problem his alternate selves seem happier than current davidkun feels yanagi also mentioned do talk statue said no thats because talks himself apparently other davids dont like david either pleasestayattractive another episode odd motivational quotes anime really more like pleasedontbecomeuncool kakkoii can mean attractive but dont think works context yea wondering translation little off handy pun like gives great massages should learn way belly button forte round off never thought hiro person standards so saachi decided go do something bitchy thought hiro would just accept but no hes like fuckthisshitimdonefortoday way keep standards got some points now what hell going lol mr 530 guy mr boyfriend made day oh btw guys stay attractive hmmm so were saying let himself go lol told him kind words startliftingweightsplease yuki chan comb your fucking hair please
