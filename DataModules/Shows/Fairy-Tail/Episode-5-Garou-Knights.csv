I guess you could say that plant is having Wendy's tonight.
the one time happy got big was i think when they actually got small or something. he never actually did the exceed transform thing. just Lily and that brainiac dude did it i'm pretty sure.

@Oldthrashbar If you don't fucking like it stop watching then.
rape .,.
Wendys, lol. But soon they'll have burgers at Natsu's or something. xD
LOL Lucy sitting on Natsu's face. Yep don't lie lucy, totally intentional.
i'm jelly.
can you say it was ass-idental
Don't look like accident. Maybe Lucy wants to feel good or cheers him up.
If Happy can't carry Lucy but can carry Natsu, I doubt thats gonna be painless.
Wow, i can tell the lies in you Lucy lies.
Lucy was extra flirty with Natsu today
Quite a few already did :<...
NALU!!!!!!!!!!
^ That face though
Lol
Geehee

^ Well, his lightning fire was mentioned in one of the episodes this season. I don't remember the context, but they acknowledged his having that power. That means it hasn't been forgotten, and will no doubt be used soon.
Semaj, Bleach had more of a "more powerful" enemy would come rendering all previous skills useless problem. He would train to get stronger, then beat him. A bit different than powering up during battle. But nonetheless still the same effect
It is hard to tell how strong Natsu is. in some instances he's insanely OP then in others I'm like really? I can't gauge anybody's strength in this at all. All I know is 'Oh, they're supposedly extremely powerful' but I don't see it.
thats how they keep the series going you never know who's stronger then who at least thats what i think like when erza was about to fight laxus you think she could have won who knows I'm sure we will eventually find out

Wendy and Natsu Tag Team YES SIR!!
IT WAS SO COOL OMG!!!
love it!

Definitely taking after Gajeel.
I can't remember if he'd done that before or not, but hilarious nonetheless!
every time i watch the opening, my ships just sail
... i hate to admit it but its that pop song you just can't hate
i love this opening
Totally shipping NaLu here too~! x3 With the end of that OP, you can't help it~<3
Guys, guys. Calm your **** THE ENDING MAKES MY SHIPS SAIL.>.<
The OP and ED are just teasing us, Natsu is really stealing Kirito's SAO mojo and building a harem. NaLu, NaLi and now NaYu!
lol Lucy's "Fat" getting stuck in the crevice xD
I wish 20 minutes of fairy tail = 20 minutes of microwave. Time goes by way too fast.
I would be happy with just the last min of microwave time. That shit takes forever
20min in the microwave? Wth are you cooking in there?
I think he's saying that Fairy Tail goes by really fast and he wishes something boring like microwaving food seemed that quick.
The intro is so good that I have to pause it in order to go to the bathroom!
IKR!!! I just love the OP!
The real question is.. Why wouldn't you go to the bathroom BEFORE starting the awesome opening?!
Yeah this and Log Horizons intros are the best.
another group of fools that are about to get their asses kicked by natsu and friends.....
It's time to face the music, Sabertooth Guild master. He's a dick and deserved that punch from Sting.
Well, no one outside the guild knows that yet I think.
and if then know, im sure they will keep it a secret IF THEY like living
Sting sabertooth master only Minerva and the saber guild know about it.
To be fair, Minerva only stated that she nominated him as the new guild master. There may be some method of officializing guild mastership that prevents his being recognized as its present retainer. Or not, but it's possible, anyway.
The thing is that the current master is seriously wounded but Sting is not the master yet.
Sorry I know it's cliche - but 19:30 "I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going"
Many were thinking it.
all this waiting must be bad for our health -_-
Loved the extra NatLu stuff.
Just wait for the best NaLu moment of them all in like 10 episodes or more from now.
That was totally a manga spoiler >.> ugh now I wanna see that episode!
after finishing my 4th semester at university I can celebrate it by watching the new episode of fairy tail !!! YEAH >.<
Kinda funny how Lily adopted Gajeels laugh.
man, I never get tired of the opening. Such an amazing song.
awwwww natsu so cute when he's embarrassed about Lucy
LOLOLOL @ 12:16 Natsu you lucky bastard!!!!!! XD

Well, lets get ready for a beat up on Fairy Tail at first and then they just POWN everything around them. After all, the same magic does not work twice on Fairy Tail Members. Gray pointed that out pretty neatly when he defeated Rufus.
