Kuroko's like "Use Your Freaking Godmode Already!", and Kise's like "Friendship Level Max: Activating Godmode" What a machine.

It was risky but necessary - it saved 2 peoples' sports careers, loved it.
Aomine's become such a Papa Bear since losing to Taiga ^_^
TKO!
Aomine just did what we all wanted to do throughout this entire mini-arc.

Think it's normal for Japanese schools as they're big on recycling - and they often seperate trash into combustible/non-combustibles.

All I can think of is Danny from JoJo
Furnaces are love, Furnaces are life.
Plot twist, the furnace is the last boss.
That was...kind of anticlimactic.
When you thought 1 generation of miracles was hard enough to fight against, Kise's now a 3-in-1 bundle!

he could never copy taiga's jumping power though which why Taiga's so good and anyone else curious what kind of player akashi is cause Kise didnt show any of his skill

^ DuneSpira94, spoiler comment alert bro
my bad! I thought I clicked it...
Kise still can't copy Kuroko and that's all that really matters.
I think it's more Kise hasn't tried copying Kuroku
well kuroko's thing is not being seen. If you know where he is etc. he struggles so he would not want to copy it. Although they might try to do it in another episode.
For one thing, Kise is to "visible" to copy Kuroko. I mean, he's a model for pete's sake.
If Kuroko used misdirection overflow would that let Kise copy it?
Its explained in the first season that kuroko has developped this ability because he is small and can use other players as a cover. Plus his mastery of directing peoples attention to the ball. 1 problem for kise is his size.
Thank god, no more thumb licking!!!


It's so unsanitary, man.
Only in an anime would not attacking someone be a sign of respect XD love it
Seems like Tanba quit Baseball and started with Basketball
Dat Ace of Diamon reference. But, he might be recognize as "The Bald One" in Haizaki's team
LOL
That Kuroko...Voicing his feelings when he has to in order to help you out

Two episodes till we get to see the captain of the Generations of Miracles playyyy :0
Didn't the preview show Shutoko (Midorima) versus Rakuzan (Akashi) in the next episode? I can't wait to finally see Akashi play. I have no idea what his style or special ability would be.
its already out it just isn't on crunchyroll yet
I think I'm in love with Aomine. T_T
That tounge thing he does is so fucking stupid, over done, and annoying. I wanna cut it out of his throat my self.
Kise was like, you like pillaging moves? Please, that's nothing compared to my Perfect Copies. Get on my level.
This episode is a hard hitting one. My respect for Aomine has gone through the roof.
yes!

I feel like Aomine is Vegeta...you hate him just so you can end up loving him. lol
Aomine just made my day, Well Played.
Crunchyroll is so behind on this series. Do they have any plan to catch up?
