i have to admit i teared up too
I didn't tear up ,but I was about to. Amazing !
same here, same here

Woah... and slow-mo flying punch for the win. I had just been replaying the flying head from last week to pass the time until this episode ~~
music. And the voice actors are also really skilled. So utterly amazing.
no broseid0n you you buy cheap turtle beach they are awesome awesome i say
Broseid0n, Turtle Beach headphones are awesome! I've had mine for a good 4 years now, absolutely no problems with them at all.
the actors really put their hearts into it. they took this anime seriously and actually put emotion into it.
Armin's voice actor is particularly good, imo.
Attack on Titan on a Saturday Night? Christmas came early this year!!!
i know! and such a kick ass episode too! YES!
Well i guess i was right but how ?
I AM CRYING. THE EMOTIONS. THE FEELINGS. ARE SO STRONG.
yes Q~Q the feels! D':
I've been a member since 2010 and I've only made one comment and that was a question in the forums. I have to post that THIS EPISODE WAS....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, Dragon Ball Z and this. Fantastic.
@mudduck454 if what you said is true then we would have a lot more anime fans in the u.s it's more the opposite, most people dont what to watch anime because of the drama,i agree with you eduardo screw ign the only reason why they like
attack on titan is because of all the blood you got to remember that ign is one of the groups that say gears of war is a emotional story about humanity when its not(yes i played gow 1...not emotional at all) . i find ign very 2 sided
Why are we comparing Gears Of War to Attack On Titans? Never compare a video game to anime. And IGN. Really? *Shaking head in disbelief*

I saw that too. Now my question is does the military already know that? :x

so its people eating people? evolution? lol



Well said
Man, all them bastards are creepy with the permanent grins! Ugh! I liked how Eren gave that mini titan the BOOT! Lol!!!
They should run her as a joke in saimoe this year for shits and giggles.
Yeah what was with the random cute eyed titan. Im glad to see it gone.
"They should run her as a joke in saimoe this year for shits and giggles" What do you mean for shits and giggles? She'd win no contest and you know it!

The injection will come into play soon i can almost guarantee. This story just keeps getting better.
Okay what is with the dreams, am starting to feel like they aren't dreams at all. seems like time got messed with somehow..............
Kids this is what happens to you if you do drugs.
OH MY GLOB!!!!
@Dasquareful: Then those are some awesome drugs
I am totally loving the soundtracks in every single one of these episodes. So epic, and match the scene perfectly. Hope they get released soon.

it was done by the same person who composed Gundam Unicorn. i love both soundtracks, and i also love the fact that it took me 7 AoT episodes to realize they were made by the same person.
When the Titan that killed Thomas appeared, and that EPIC CHORUS started playing, you just KNEW that something AMAZING was about to happen! :D And the serene music played when they find "him" alive? Damn, I can't wait for this Soundtrack!



You are lucky that has been spoiled for me dozens of times, otherwise I would have been very pissed off. People shouldn't spoil other shows even if they think everyone saw it. There is ALWAYS someone reading who hasnt. ALWAYS.
seriously...
I called it before even going to the wikipedia page to see if it was Eren. I thought they were going to go that route like in Gurren Lagann. I'm glad they didn't.
^well even gurren lagann never killed the main char off. there are very few series that will actually kill the mc and replace him... granted the guy they killed was cooler than the mc, but he still wasnt the mc.
"Well Shit" That is the best way to sum up what just happend
I'd have said that too, but my in-laws are here! Lol!
i said that when i saw eren die thats all i was saying along with wtf!
HOLY SHIT!!!! that ending
Shush, Conny. When Armin says "I have a plan", you shut up and you listen.
Darkmagic, best comment on this video, hands freaking down.
Armin is the OG E.F. Hutton
"Hello, I'm Armin Cain." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBeU2utihwM
Ahhhh that was funny to read
^^^^^^^^^^^^
crunchyroll if you keep on posting this episode this early for the rest upcoming episodes I will be the happiest girl alive. Thank you.


I'm still curious to know what his dad had in the basement
[This comment has been removed]
I thought he was going to be a "weretitan" at first...heh. Yes, this is much better.
@Primedestroyer Unfortunately, even in the manga, you wont find out. I don't know if the anime will even make it that far.


THAT WAS AWESOME

One does not simply, skip the opening

I don't because AT&T sucks and it would freeze every time but the op is dumb, and i'm a guy with well over 50 op's on my mp3 player (phone)
I NEVER SKIP, I JUST LOVE IT!!
Crunchyroll is not Midnight yet.. you guys re amazing
I ask a minute of silence for our beloved Titan-chan. May his cute fiendish eyes never be forgotten (T^T)
Rest in peace to the cute Titan...
Titan-chan will not be forgotten
OMFG TITAN-CHAN. I LAUGHED MORE THAN NECESSARY WHEN I READ THAT. xD
damn it mikasa you made me cry with you

lol @ this makes me moist
epic commment for sure! haha
I knew it the whole time that it was Eren. It had to be seeing as how the show from the get go was centered around Eren. I wouldve stopped watching it if it wasnt him, lol love this show.
When does this show air? When can we get new episodes?
O__O
wish someone would hold me the way mikasa held eren at the end of this episode
