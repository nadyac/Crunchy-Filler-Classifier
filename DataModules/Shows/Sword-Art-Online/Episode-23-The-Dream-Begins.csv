"I added stabilizers, but try not to move around suddenly" *Asuna stands suddenly* "Okay!"
I hope I have the ability to "like" posts again before the next episode airs. That "one or more missing values" error message is getting on my nerves. On topic: Remember, folks! "The higher you climb, the further you fall."
Im not crying your crying
Dammit Asuna!
@AnamixBlade whom does the crying belong to?
@CluelessProgram i liked your reply just because of that quote
That little Asuna though. So cute. Dang.
@CluelessProgram I also got the impression that they showed two different ages when she was at her grandparents. First seemed sub 10, maybe even as young as 5. Second seemed closer to 12-13.
I can't like this commeny for some reason, so consider this comment as my like.
my favorite part in the whole episode was those few seconds where they show the marriage ring on Asuna's left ring finger
@Ayumi_21 Odd, I've never heard of "commeny" before. Can you tell me the reason you can't like it? And is there anything to prevent me from liking it?
"Commeny" is a comment. And he means like the comment ABOVE him. Not his comment.
well know i understand why the house they bought is so important ^_^
This is the first time, that I can recall, that she was so happy while at home. She's finally freed from her from her melancholy bird cage. (Apologies for the corny analogy.)
Is it just me or does Asuna's sub account - which I recall is a Sylph knife nut specced for pure melee dps - look a lot like her mother IRL? Which raises some interesting thoughts regarding how Asuna views her mom, IMO.
@therebel56 Don't you mean it's near the woods where they met Yui, not Yuuki? They both met Yuuki when they fought her separately at that huge tree. Either way, it's the same house all around.
There's a short side story about that house & how when Asuna and Kirito go to purchase it in ALO it's stuck in one of those huge cedars w/Argo the rat in it. wtf? They have to do a very funny, twisted fairytale quest to get the house back.
@CluelessProgram I agree Asuna's sub account does look a lot like her mother. I could see her mom coming back to the virtual world in the future. It would be quite interesting how she reacts to how badass/OP Kirito is haha.
No fights with monsters or other action scenes. You know you love the characters when an episode is all talk and you're experiencing happy tears just listening to them.
Commenting on each others weight made me laugh. Asuna's mom is pretty cute in game
Well, of course the action in this series has always been great, but I love the episodes like this, too. Very important for story and character development. Can't wait to get to this part in the LN, also.

he did pull out Excalibur at the exact moment you're referring to though. Right before she enters the room, he pulls out his second sword which is Excalibur now. he saves the most badass of swords for the most badass of occasions.
agreed.
Did anyone think it would have been funny if Asuna's mom would have met her virtual daughter Yui?
But then it'll probably be really difficult to explain how they have Yui in the first place.. So you see mom, we "got" her from a "Magical" room, where Kirito and I went..
Yeah, I wanted it to happen so much and I did think that was the point of bringing her there. Totally a missed opportunity. Well, maybe someday. I want to see it when it happens though.
but Yui's programming lives in Kirito's computer so that could really only happen in a situation where Asuna introduces her to all her friends.
Damn SAO,, you made me so sad q.q..... Cant shed a tear but im getting all kinds of water in my eyes. FALL DAMN YOUUU!!
omg xD She would've flipped!
0:55 "Okay, Asuna try not to make any sudden movements"....Jump out of chair... seriously?
Carter: DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT ARE COMIN OUT OF MY MOUTH?!
@ ExiaShiro: ????? What are yo trying to say? ?????
He likes fried burritos. Can u not read!?
@DeadlyOats Can't tell if serious or playing along... lol. Rush Hour was a great movie, though.
I was thinking how hers daughter was protected for 2 years from dying but the mom says she can't see Kazuto anymore. If I had a child and this happened to me i would be giving the ok
"over here yuuki is the cafeteria where you can buy food. Next we have the gym where people can play sports and have a school meeting. And finally the library where you can learn anything, except what happened the Klein's pizza in season 1"
Your right we all better keep our eyes open...
what was even on the pizza xD
lol
It's gonna kill us all!!!!!!!!!!!
i was wondering what happened to the pizza!! my friends keep on asking me if worrying about the pizza was important, IT IS!!
'It should be very different than your real weight' and 'Your the same as the other side but the real thing seems a little pudgier.' Lmao at the mother daughter in game banter
I love anime like this, when some episodes are just emotional and not because someone died
(that last part) lol akame ga kill *cough*

Ikr, I was crying through the entire episode and I loved second of it.
it has taken me over a day to finish this episode because i can't get myself past the amazing theme song!!
I kinda felt that "Yuuki Yuuki" joke coming
I was waiting anxiously for it. It made me chuckle.
The grin I had at seeing loli Asuna. Who else found her irresistibly cute when she ate those oranges?
I have to say, she's possibly even cuter than Yui.
Where do you think Yui got her cuteness from?
Thats a bold statement bro.
*raises hand* Aww...
I pretty much melt when I saw little Asuna. She was (is) so adorable!!!!
That awkward moment when Asuna's mom becomes part of Kirito's harem. *shivers
Why not? I think it's a good lesson to teach your child about taking in and thinking about your life choices. I know about several of my parents' regrets, and I feel very close with them because of it.
No one officially joins the harem until Kirito pats them on their head. Asuna's mom is still safe..... for now.
He already has a blonde, being his cousin(sister). The man is trying to get one for each type of fairy race so he can become the very best. Like no one ever was to catch them is his real test, o train them is his cause.
@Alternate_One. MoeMon, you know it's their destiny
That would have been totally awesome if Kirito had managed to embarrass himself in front of Asuna by flirting with her "Asuna's new friend" only to figure out it was her mother.
Sorry Kirito, Yuuki is joining team Asuna, not your harem. ^.~
No, wifi isn't fine. Even, and especially, in well populated areas. All the wireless transmissions interfere with each other. Sometimes you'll get lucky and be in a place where the signal is good, but most of the time wifi is spotty.
Since this show isn't in the present based off of current tech. It's possible they created a way to connect to overlapping networks simultaneously never losing connection. Also wireless tech would be advanced being able to cover more.
Let's just say that they have 6G now and WiFi is obsolete.
I won't worry about the wifi/ 4G-6G and all that. Japan has one of the top internet speeds in the world so they can probably do it normally in some areas.
Small, Rich country. I would bet it's considerably cheaper to upgrade internet infrastructure than it is in the US (especially Canada). Thus we see services providing 2gbps download. Something to drool about.
I cant stop the tears right now :'(. I must be in the game.
God freaking Sword Art, always finds a way to move your heart and shake your soul. Beautiful as always <3
Asuna: Mom, let me take you into my world. Asuna's Mother: Why? Where are we going? Asuna: We're going on a feels trip.
Cheap shot on Asuna's part, mentioning her mother's mom and dad is a little manipulative. I guess when you only have five minutes you've gotta work with what you've got.
Bringing a friend to SAO recovery school without any questions or slip-ups feels about as unlikely as bringing a friend to Fight Club without talking about Fight Club. We're seriously milking this secret for all it's worth, Asuna.
Well, I really would be surprised if Asuna hadn't spoken about this ahead of the time with the hospital, with them then contacting the school asking for permission.
"Good morning, professor! Mind if I bring another virtual reality-trapped player to school today?" "Sure! Why not? Are they Clingon?" "Well... you might say that..."
It's well explained in the LN to her professor, and in the show he mentions that Asuna spoke to him earlier. I see no problem here.
And it's not like they would go around talking about it...Sup John, have any horrific SAO flashbacks last night?
I appreciate the heads up on the LN background, but I'm not talking about keeping Yuuki's secrets from the class. I'm talking about keeping the entire class's story from Yuuki. Some of us want Yuuki to finally know Asuna's background, too.
"What an inconvienient world. boohoo" -Asuna's mom, 2024
So Yui was the "Beta Tester" for Yuuki's camera. I see where this is going.
[This comment has been removed]
Well you can still consider Yui being the beta tester....or alpha and Yuuki is the beta tester. Just because it was designed for one thing doesn't mean it can't be used for another.
The internet of today came out of the networks designed from the cold war. Many advances in everyday living have come from differently applied uses of technology that we didn't realize until we tried it.
I mean, the adhesive used in Sticky Notes was made from a failed attempt at making a permanent adhesive.
Yui is a beater!
