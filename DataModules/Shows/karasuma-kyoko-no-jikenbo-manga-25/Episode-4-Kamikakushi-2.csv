Nice episode
I enjoy the ED song.
This was another good episode. Kyoko did something humans shouldn't be able to do. I think Kyoko is in for a real shocking revelation sometime down the road. Also, the VA was better in this episode (but we'll see how it goes from here).
1st, I so enjoy a good anime about bureaucratic naivety, its a wonder we get the series a month early; good thing I stumbled on this. As usual Japanese society refuses to believe at large they are not 'the country of gods', just demons.
