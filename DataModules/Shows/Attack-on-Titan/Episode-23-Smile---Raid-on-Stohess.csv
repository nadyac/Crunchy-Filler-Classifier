Ahh Another cliffhanger, but JOKE IS ON YOU ATTACK ON TITAN, I WAS READY FOR THAT!!!! You can't fool me for 23 weeks in a row!!! Hahahahaha! NEXT WEEK! All hell is going down!!! Can't Wait!
Awesome, very good episode. Yay, Armin!!
@Tech, orrrrr you can not read the comments till AFTER you watch you the episode...cause that works as well
That laugh actually turned me on.. Though it was probably the blushing, and/or Mikasa's badass stance... xD
These cliffhangers have definitely made putting off watching this show for so long worth it. I couldn't have done this week to week thing like you guys did, man.
Nope, twenty minutes of suspension. You can be tricked by ATTACK ON TITAN!!!!
Armin right now is the most useful character in this series, up to current development.
If Armin was a female I wonder how odd it'd be for Eren to have both his best friends be women. I mean if you only had girls as friends, many would interpret that as EXTREME friend-zoning.
@shadowtonberry It's kinda funny that anyone can call him useless I mean without him Eren would of never tried to save him and got eaten and never unlocked the Titan abilty's. Plus the city would of been ashes without his planning.
Ikr. and if Eren still go eaten which he would have. Who would have cme up with the titan plan?
Why Armin is my favorite... it saddens me he is such an under appreciated character
but he isn't under appreciated at all if he was he wouldn't be shown as much. No instead he is very important to the story just like when he came up with the plan to take back the wall and even when Eren asked him what he should do.
Military Police? You mean the Bitch Brigade?
@babyglitterc You realize that its spelled 'avant-garde' and not 'avant-guarde,' right? And you also just called The Bitch Brigade, Pussy Patrol, and Cunt Crusaders experimental and innovative. You obviously need to think before you post.
@suryp #sarcasim
The amount of one liners in this thread is reminiscent of 6th grade, and how much I am laughing at it shows how mature my sense of humor is omfg

She might have either liked him, or highly respected him, because of his solid logic. She spared him twice, and I think when their gear was being checked, during that conversation, was when she realized her respect/feelings for him.
She said he had guts. I think she respects him a bit for it

IDK i find her hot
ok
Nothing action-related actually happens this ep. Still feels like less than 5 min. They're obviously doing something very right.
Aw, maaaannnnnnn, the shit's about to hit the fan within the cushy Wall Sina! Damn, for Aramin to pick all that up from the very first encounter with Annie! Dude's skittish, but damn, he's sharp!
They didn't really even try to hide it was her though. I mean, the first time the female Titan showed up I was like "Hmm, that looks like that Leonheart chick". Plus, she was one of the only ones who didn't go to the Survey Corps.
And she looks like the female titan exactly.
I figured, but I still don't know WHY?!? What is the motive? GAAAAAHHHH!!!
Figure 17 was 47 minutes per episode (1 hour when aired with commercial breaks). By comparison, Break Blade was a series of movies, and each was closer to 50 minutes each.
Katanagatari also had 50 minute episodes.
Tenchi Muyo: War on geminar has those long episodes as well.
they left a lot of dialog out of this episode that was in Manga. Like the flashback of Annie training with her father, the dialog in the manga was totally different.
@Darkside_Hero You can't really expect them to add in every snippet of dialogue that's in the manga, there's too much and they'd end up making less progress in the storyline per epsiode.
MY god, Annie was super hot this episode (21:23) and Mikasa too

Went to google, did an image search for Hunter x Hunter, then for Attack on Titan. Clearly AoT is more badass. Google doesn't lie.

Image searching an anime means nothing. If you base an anime's appeal off of it's artwork you're missing out on a lot. Each series is good in it's own right.
When are they not?!
I wish every episode was 60 minutes...
I wish every episode was just 30min -_- 24min whole thing-4min of intro/credits=20min of actual episodes... sigh

Just watch every 3 weeks, and then you'll have your 60 minutes!
@rayray-: You mean sword? The singular? Because only one blade was attached @ 20:53. The other handle was wielded solely for MG use.
@suikojay i have trouble waiting till late at night to watch AOT along with my other anime. i dont think i can make it that long knowing a new episode is up.
Aahhhh, how I longed to hear that opening for the past 604,800 seconds.
21:46 That big guy knows parkour XD
yeah i liked that
Seeing him do that made me drop out of the moment for a second to laugh.
I honestly find hardly anything wrong with this series. A recent review talked about how the show was mediocre in comparison to what it could be: how much better could it be, honestly?
I guess slow pace means plot and character development. Maybe if they had changed the episode titles more often, then some people will think it moves faster. It feels slow because it's so great that you want MOAR!!!! 30min not enough.
In all honesty, I'd prefer the anime to stay as true to the original work as possible, for numerous reasons, foremost being is that they could change something early on, but it could have a HUGE impact later on in the anime.
There actually is a lot of Original Content here in the anime. In the manga, Annie had a much longer speech to Marlow, Marlow didn't get beat up, and Annie didn't have that hysterical laughing, but a smug smile, while sweating.
yes.. but the lauging was hot..
@Rantae Annies laugh was something Isayama came up with. A combination of a bunch of different emotions. It's not 'original content'. http://nolaneko.tumblr.com/post/61348614374/hajim
Am I the only one who is shocked by Annie's Blushing?!?
her laugh was cute
Not sure if it was blushing, but I was pretty shocked about the laugh! That came from out of nowhere.
mmmmmh Mikasa in a ponytail!

I think they broke Annie
HERE BE CLIFFHANGERS! TREAD LIGHTLY!
I am the one who knocks!
THe ring had to do that since she would have been caught otherwise....
Good cliffhangers are priceless.
Lol right when I saw Jean, I could tell what he is thinking by his expression . "Why the fuck, am I doing this shit?" could be his thoughts. hahahahaah
Glad to see the survey corps hasn't gone to the wolves yet, can't wait to see how this farce holds up. Last episode made it sound like it was the end of the SC.
Annie... Mmm...
Armin: "Don't worry you both look like Criminals. You both have nasty eyes". Erin: "I don't have a long horse face like him". LOL!!! way to break the tension.
Speaking of looks, I've been thinking that ever since I first saw his teenage design, that Eren's eyes look almost exactly like Link's in LoZTP. Wild and feral -- a good match for his titan form.
I think Eren owes Jean a lunch or something.
Annie are you OK, are you OK Annie?
This episode was definitely a crescendo
Lol, @ishida & @Rogun, you two are good!!!
@ishida617 I think "smooth Kyojin" works better here, lyrically. I'll have my people call your people, we'll get it settled.
LOOL
I knew it. I knew it so hard.

no one knows but those who have read the manga you really should spoiler that
Manga is monthly... Expect a long wait for season 2, maybe a year or more. For many this anime will basically be over by the 25/26th episode. D:

@UnrealSniper2kXi I thought the same thing. She's the only blond haired girl with a different nose, and it was odd that she joined the Military Police despite her being bad@$$.
Clever, clever Armin!
^It's a storytelling style wherein they'd skip a certain part (a meeting where Armin laid down his hunch and the Survey Corps decided to act on it) and so this ep assumes everyone knows Armin's plan, that's why Annie called it Armin's "bet"
@pikpikbak, episode 17, the one in which the female titan appears for the first time to kick ass. In the episodes following the encounter, Armin also speaks other clues. The last, technically first, clue I caught is on the third episode.
They'll most likely explain it next week.
@gumsteven Give it a little bit. All will be revealed.
@Hezzdini Well, It is a common id, ego, alter ego trio. Other examples include Kirk, Spock, and McCoy or Harry, Hermione, and Ron. I think that even Hanji, Levi, and Erwin may make up another one as well. 3 in general is recurring in AoT
Armin has all of my respect!
Armin, Erin, and Mikasa make me think of the Triforce. Armin holds the Triforce of Wisdom, Erin holds the Tryforce of Courage and Mikasa has the Triforce of Power...yeah, I am nerd.
[This comment has been removed]
hmm. except id say eren has triforce of power, since you know.. titan stuff and hes not really "brave" hes more genocidal about titans..
BPFHT3VA4FK
Gosh this Annie is as psycho as the LoL Annie xD
