"Who thinks Hanji Zoe needs their own show?" Yes she does despite her being a bit weird and creepy at the same time
I love her. She's original and refreshing. She dances to nobody's tune except her own and shes crazy and you know it. That's what makes her good at killing Titans.
DAMN CUTE EYED TITAN CHARACTER... WHY DOES EVEYONE USE THAT! ITS CREEPY
The Kawaii Titan?

How to meet new people. Step 1, sniff them for long periods of time. Step 2, Smirk. Works every time.
If you know you're not going to meet that person again why not make a complete ass of yourself? (Troller's handbook, rule 7)
sniff that scent XD
of course it helps!
i did this and it works! i promise!
senpai please sniff me!

He has no room to be merciful or nice on the battlefield where he is fighting. Against the Titans, he has to walk the line between their bloodlust and maintaining his own humanity.

After all that training, it seems Mikasa let her pimp hand get weak.
so he can regenerate, lovely
She mastered Killua's death face..
Wow, is that Armin soaked in blood? Wow.

during the op i thought i was watching some sort of Illuminati

Mikasa's death glares at Levi...fight, fight fight!
Okay I will wait and decide for myself who is stronger Levi or Mikasa well once the episode reaches that point. Reading the manga is great but personally see it animated is better for me.
That'd be an interesting fight
I think Mikasa wouldn't be in the same league as Levi at this point. She seems to have prodigal talent though.
Mikasa is the beastliest.
Beastlie?! More like total Hotlie! She's pretty, she's smart, she's got huge heart and - she can kick gawd all mighty kindsa @ss. Yup, I'd follow that woman anywhere, 'till they enforced the restraint order at least.

good joke and seeing as how everything he does he gets abused in one way or another he probably should but that's BS the one person that really stands for humanity and tries to be his own man gets the shaft...everytime? SMH

Well, you know, realism and all that..
I literally thought the same thing!
i love how many people were waiting for the second this came out XD
'Feels' similar in tone to Berserk; dark, supernatural vibe & distinct, driven characters. Really enjoying the anime, does it rep the manga well? Can't wait for more
I've heard it does. The flow of the story is changed for the better and the art is better than in the manga. This is according to other comments I have read.
I love the manga and anime is so epic love how they bring everything to life so worth watching wait for it everytime
Well, at least waiting for the free user's version to come out.

I suspect the next 11 episodes are going to be awesome since he made it into the survey corps and has some titan power. its gettin pretty good!
i agree....kinda wish he'd get stronger without it but Titan mode does have it's uses
Knowing Levi, he'll kick Erin's ass if he keeps on relying on an unpredictable, moral destroying ability that will likely get him killed...cause he's nice like that
BUT THEY CHANGED THE SOUNDTRACK!!!!! *CRIES IN CORNER*
Mikasa isn't afraid of anybody! Not even Levi. Death glare galore.

I feel like that might be her super power *-* Because remember before she was able to fight that titan even tho she'd said to herself that she'd given up? Maybe her super power is never giving up? o.o
After I watched the opening I had watch it again.. Bring on the mashups internet! Good eps. I think I'm enjoying the political stuff more than the action scenes!

I gotta say, I was really nervous when I heard there was a new opening. But I think this one is pretty respectable, considering how hard it is to follow-up something like the phenomenon Guren no Yumiya became.
I liked the first one better. The second one is okay too, but I seem to like the first one because it has such a dark, 'we will win' tone to it
"holyshet ~starts anime~ GAAAAAAAAH ~falls over whimpering~ ....n...n....n-nerdgasm ~moans really loud~



didn't expect that
... Levi copied my personal... creepy...
wait whaaaaaaaaat? trunks watches AOT
Levi is definitely a sadist LOL
Eren is M!
ship.
Lmao, Hanji @ 8:15. XDDD
I haven't been this interested in a court type setting since Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere.
Yes. that anime was unexpectedly good.
I wish that Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere would get another season (or ten - there are a freaking huge number of novels for that series).
Confusing, but still alright.
What is it about??

Lets not forget all of the Levi x Eren fanart but I think the Japanese got a jump on us with that one.
let's ship this all the way to japan and back
I love Levi.s character! reminds me alot of Sogo, sadist bastards.. lol
@minshall428 Lol, yeah. His sadistic eyes in the moment made me almost forget that he was Levi and not Sogo kicking around Eren. Not only that, he totally sounded like Sogo when he was talking about killing Eren, as if he was Hijikata.
Levi is just "ok" in my book. Eren did nothing wrong/he doesn't know whats happening to him. He spoke up for himself and wants to fight for humanity and he gets his asskicked? Levi had made his point and kept going ham..No Sorry,yea he's ok
xD Levi is to Eren as Sogo is to Hijikata
animemarc you dont get how badly levi just saved erens big titan ass... That beat down was a fucking blessing from god. & @ nightblade your so right for a momment when he looked at eren he sounded and look just like sogo.
Gintokii!!!

@animemarc I think the point is that pride and survival are two very different things. It is sad but it also adds a gritty realism. It's a re-occurring theme that adds flavor to this anime; what they want isn't what they get.
@animegurl7 "What kind of show would it be if Eren was all OP right from the start? All heroes are weak. They work their way up." They already made that show, it's called Batman.

@animemarc the reason Eren gets his ass handed to him all the time is because if the world in SNK was real then everything that has happened thus far is pretty realistic. Main characters don't get all the shine and glory and some even die
This isn't a Hollywood superhero movie. The growth of a human character with whom real people can relate (Eren, Jean) is much more interesting than an unrealistic meathead who has some magical "never lose" ability. (Levi, Mikasa)
New opening isn't as good as last one
100% agreement just doesn't seem to have that same impact that the older one had it would always get me ready for the roller coaster that is this show.
The first ED was just too good its in first place in my list of all intros/outros
It had me as soon as it started D:
I thought it was a little creepy to be honest... Armin soaked in blood... O_o
the voice of the ed though.. .///mmm tasty voice
that was sick want so much more
Despite the first opening being godly and difficult to follow up, this one was not that bad in my opinion.
