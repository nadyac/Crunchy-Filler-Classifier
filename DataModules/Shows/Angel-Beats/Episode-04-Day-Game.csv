even death cant cure stupidity LOL
But you seriously can't call how they died real deaths, it's just too fast, it's almost like a joke to them (which really is), Realization like how the lead singer turned obliterated is true death, the one and only moments that happen once.

You can't say Ota's death was fast...

they should so have used the baseball game as the time to break into her room insted, i mean she was gone for hours this time, they could have copied her whole HD in that time.
But then there would be no feels in that episode. The lead singers ballad and departure that bought enough time to learn that Angel was modifying herself is what made the whole episode outstanding.
Everyone was playing Baseball at the time, even Christ was there on his computer, they can't get in without Christ.
either way, Yui is so kawaii!!!
Other than that, there wasn't a guarantee that she would have responded to the extra sign ups at the baseball game. It WAS certain she'd take the concert bait.

hahaha TK " crazy baby " I started lmao when he said that
TK is kinda weird to me...
This anime is like every other anime ever rolled into one. Rock band + Baseball + Ghosts + Slice of life + Comedy + Action + Amnesia...i'm waiting for the giant robots to come out.
Now all they need are gundams and titans
also video games have yet to be implimented
I dont know, we've got a computer nerd already... if he pulls out a PFP I'm gonna die.
We need some kaiju.
No we need the piano opening back
Hahaha how does she keep the broom on her finger while doing baseball
She is a ninja. One does not ask a ninja "how." One simply accepts the fact that she is a ninja and greater than the common man/woman.
Yui = the shit * Instant Yui fan right here, people
I wonder what happens if you kill a NPC?
they respawn if you leave town.
Drug reference? O:
I miss the piano opening 'o.O
You're not the only one. ;(
I'm hoping it was just a one time OP for Yui's performance.
yui is super funny love her XD
She's even funnier in the English dub.

About time a girl in a anime who is the one who is abused and not the guy and better yet , she got revenge and kicked his butt to , i love to see fairness~ Also i am hoping to learn about that new girl soon , her tail needs answers.
anyone else notice that those who are obliterated aren't in the ending credits anymore?
It's the little things like that, that make shows like this as beautiful as they are.
I found it funny that that they were only recruiting morons...but I still kinda found that mean though
Am i the only one that got the "crazy baby..." part after she hung herself on accident at like 2:32? That was funny.
YOU IDOIT YUI WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DAM DO THAT!!
