Aoshi, a man who can carry four people while having been shot in the leg multiple times. A man's man!
In the anime they don't show it, but in the manga when the police arrive all the Oniwabanshu member corpses are headless. So in the next scene you see Aoshi walking off with their heads and he buries the heads.
Thanks for the information BIGdLover
One of them being a fatass ogre thing, and one of them being a really buff manly man XD
So so many Aoshi feels in this episode.
I was so pissed the first time i watched this when i was a kid. I wanted Kenshin to kill that stupid glasses guy... now that i'm watching it the 3rd time, i still feel the same.. >_>
Damn that Takeda Kanryu, I wish Kenshin had at least cut his nose or something.
i wish if kenshin killed that A-hole...
I don't get it, is he still after kenshin? After Kenshin saved his life...
I'm kinda getting attached to the way he talks, that I am.
did anyone notice how fast kenshin healed... like by the time he picked up his sword again...

Aoshi is so tall... XD
That and Kenshin is really short.
If this episode has taught us anything it is that you always want to have more than one gatling gun. Like three or four maybe would do the trick.
From 13:18 to 13:20, Kenshin's mouth keeps moving even though there is no voice.
Shinomori Aoshi. You will be remembered as a true muthafucking G
So I look over in the margin and see "Other Romance Shows." Kenshin is a romance?!
i was just wandering the same thing

yes, between Kenshin and Kaoru
This is completely half Shonen and half Shoujo.
Reminds me of that time Poland wasted most of it's military budget outfitting cavalry to fight the Germans in World War II. He laughed kinda like a maniacal Nazi, as well.
Wanna know something funny about what you said eight months ago? Kanryu's seiyuu was the same one who voices The Major in the Hellsing OVAs: Nobuo Tobita. In other words, he *has* voiced a Nazi.
so much honor ;(
