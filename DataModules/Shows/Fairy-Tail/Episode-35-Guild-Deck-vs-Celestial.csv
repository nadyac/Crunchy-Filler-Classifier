she totally forgot Natsu's special effect if lucy is targeted/attacked Natsu magically appears on the field wrecking everything in his path
well if natsu had seen any guild member cry lightning-flame mode and infinate attact power I guess


This is Awesome, but in my book Gildarts would be ranked as a SSS or triple S class wizard :-D or somewhere around there :-D And @geonator290 that is so true :-) or well at least Natsu must be very exhausted to do so or something like that
Cana didn't read Wing Nappy Dragoneel's secondary effect: When faced with losing he will get fired up and progressively gain 5,000,000,000 attack points per enemy and new enemies that enter the field. (losses all points on rides)
And then I use the field card 'GRAY STRIPS'! Seriously, this game would be awesome!
Ya where can I buy a deck?? XD
just wait itll be a real thing if warcraft can make a card game from there mmo i think we can get a Fairy tail card game too
They are doing (did?) a Fairy Tail Weiss Schwarz set. It won't be a cool as this though.
Nappy Dragoneel !?!?

This is one OP card game battle. Cana needs to believe in the heart of the cards.

The Yu Gi-Oh references are strong!!!!!!!!
@JapAnimeGuru28 I agree. But man what a waste of the erza card, damn it
Well she attached te most generic armor she has

I think this is the first time in this arc where I actually was very happy with an episode, I want to see Gray dance next week HA!

It's Calvinball with cards. "My rule negates your rule!" "It would, but my rule negates your negation of my rule!"
Calvinball was exactly what I thought of during that fight.
Not to mention Cana ran herself out of cards before the 2nd turn ended, then played like 5 more. Scorpio MIGHT have had enough cards to play what he did, maybe...
I thought of Genesis from SKET-Dance with all the BS made up rules. Also, now I know why I don't watch card battle anime.

This episode is like Yugioh on crack. 500000 attack? Holy shit.

ya now they just making numbers up here lol.
@ishida617 you have watched both
@ishida617 You just watched Fairy-Gioh.
Best anime card game I've ever seen.
you can't just summon 3 happy in the same turn?! Screw the rules i have money!

none of her fights last long lol she always annihilates.
They made the mistake of making her mad...
when she summoned 3 happy's i was really expecting a blue eyes white happy..

Scorpio and Cana watched too much Yu-gi-oh to play like that.
I get the feeling the Gildarts attack power is gonna be something ridiculous. like it goes up infinitely when Cana is in danger...
Forget getting knocked into orbit, be prepared to be beaten between the next 50 realms for threatening his daughter.
Gildarts attack shreds the defending player's card deck, hand, and trash pile.
Actually liking this filler
I love the way they are taking the mick out all these "Card game animes". Making up rules as you go along, that seems about right. Awesome.
I too like to make up rules in the middle of a game.
I love how they make fun of the dumb things in Yu-Gi-Oh. Like how there's basically a card that can do something annoying in any given situation. And how one of the players happens to have a card for every bad situation that occurs.
Finally I got to see some of Gildarts. BUT WHEN WILL HE SHOW UP FOR REALS?!?! T_T
Yugi seems a little more creepy nowadays
