He'll have to walk to Kyoto naked.
It might take him a while to get to kyoto if he knocks down every tree he sees on the way there.
I will now forever imagine my Minecraft characters to be Sanosuke, running around the forest, punching down trees.
totally thought that was Kaoru hahahahaha!!!! looks exactly like her >_<
I cannot count the number of times I've made that mistake. And I should really know better by now.
I asked Mr. Miyagi if he could do what Sano was doing for training. He said, "Don't know, never been attacked by tree...."
Those four thugs forgot about the weapon triangle...
Finally a female character that is not useless!
too soon to tell
Oh Kenshin...you always find a way to get involved with the ruffians.
why the hell does he have a magnet with him?
a magnet is a poormans compass haha
I am not sure what I like better...the three-part stories or the Shishio arc.
You know, you would think that since Kenshin is friends with like every fricken big guy in the government, every chief and he also helped start the government.That they would tell the regular cops not to attack him...

Im guessing Sanosuke isn't a big environmentalist...
I like that Sanosuke stil has his zanbatou in the OP, even though he hasn't used it in about 30 episodes.
IIII'm a lumberjacku and I'm okay, I ORRA all night and HIYAA all day
kenshin looks so mon-nashi LOL binbou
