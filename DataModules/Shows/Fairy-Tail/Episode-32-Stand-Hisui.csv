The keys can only close the gates under circumstances where they would normally retreat anyways. Sounds useful.

I thought Natsu actually took them out but oh well
thats exactly what i was gonna comment, dalonehunter
Pisces is far stronger than I expected, and the hair of Natsu and Happy after the whirlwind tornado lol.
running away is losing the will to fight
That was a weird episode. Roar of the Mum. WTF?
can we pretend this episode never happened
Please.. all of you. Never speak of Jiggling Butts ever again...
To be fair, "Lucy Kick" and "Roar of the Mom" got me to chuckle.
IT IS NOT THE JIGGLING BUTTS, IT IS THE *pose* TRULY EVIL JIGGLE BUTT GANG
this never happened
If Yukino still had celestial spirits "she could use," why the hell didn't she use them last episode in the Library!?
no the snake was the 13th yukino has pisces and libra too
she left them in her other pants pocket. happens all the time
@ drake3716 This is a filler. It is definitely not in the manga trust me I've read all the chapters and the side stories.
Filler or not is starting out good well except for this weird ass episode.
maybe they weren't available to her on that day, because of different days and contact set ups,
Ka-pa-pa-pa!
What does the Pisces say?
kapa kapa
"It's not Zura, it's Katsura!"
Zura junai! Katsura da!
you have to give it to Lucy for bringing out the big guns with the Lucy kick and Plue lmao!
If those are the big guns, ugh I hate to say no, that was terrible
"It's not Zura, It's Katsura"
Kappa abilities. lol
Wasn't there a point when Lucy was getting stronger and it was a good thing? Now it's like her weakness is just another gag...
lol lucy KICK
Yup. #LucyKICK
They needed some Lucy Fire though
Lmao she goes in like some power ranger. The only thing she needs now is costume and she is all set.
This filler really ticks me off because they make nautsu seem so weak... He could have easily dealt with this 30 seconds into the episode.
That's one of the reasons I don't like the Fairy Tail fillers very much, they always underpower the characters. They just became the number one guild in Fiore and they are acting like noobs.
Hisui is cool now that she doesn't act all high & mighty like when she first came into the picture.
but I would be scared when she becomes Queen because she is FAIL with all her ideas.
This episode was quite terrible and utterly pointless, i am not liking this arc at all.

I was going to comment saying "Please message me when the fillers are over", until I realized it wasn't a filler
But.. it is a filler @.@
It's not a filler. I hate people who complain about something, but know nothing about it
Hisui, honestly, what the hell?! You're a liability in a fight, and you REFUSE Horologium's protection? And withholding important information like the location and the new Keys' limitations?! It's like one WTF moment after the other withyou
Dude chill out, before she could explain the rest of the keys, which she was in fact going to explain to them, they got attacked.
If you let them explain you might have a change of heart.
@Kingsyco123 true, I agree but it doesn't excuse princess Hisui for the mess she made with the eclipse proyect; however, what kind of spirits does she have. She did say she is a celestial wizard so she must have celestial spirits no
Yukino had celestial keys.... WHY DIDNT SHE USE THEM IN THE LIBRARY? it's like they want Vergo to take the celestial globe from last episode. Anyways, at least we got to see her pros in martial arts XD!


How did Natsu end up being an inspirational speaker?
She put a lot of emotion into that Lucy Kick. It was beautiful.
