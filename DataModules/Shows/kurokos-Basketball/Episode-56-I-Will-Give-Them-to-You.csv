In manga/anime.... YES,,,, Akashi will gouge his eyes as he has said...... he is too dangerous... In reality....... NO... :XD
With that one line, we all knew they wouldn't lose.
AKASHI IS SO FAB!
yeah, i have no doubt he wouldn't have
it reminds me of deadman wonderland

Midorima and Takao are one hell of a tag team.
It always finishes way to quickly...
too*
Grammar nazis will not be tolerated @Andrecito1992
*tolerated. You forgot a full stop. :p
that's what she said.
That what she...oh, it's already been said.

Kuroko in the zone would be so epic..
midorima: aaaakaaaaaashiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii shizuo: iiiizaaaaayaaaaaaaaaa
That was definitely a great game. Akashi is just a beast the fact that he just stares at you after you fall is just awesome.
Akashi shows why he was the generation of miracles' captain,demanding respect and planning ahead. Still, Shutoku is the star is this game, Midorima and his team playing an amazing game and refusing to give up. Mad respect for both teams.
Amen to that! It was a fantastic game.

Tag this as spoiler for the people who haven't watched yet broseph ^_^
Their teamwork was amazing! The way that Takao passed and how quickly Midorima shooted was awesome. Nice animation too
Crazy (informal, adjective) 1. mad, especially as manifested in wild or aggressive behaviour. 2. extremely enthusiastic. 3. Akashi. 4. Akashi.
Akashi really knows how to give a motivational speech.
Akashi be like an evil villain, explaining his master plan n' shit.
"There is no shame in falling. The only shame is in not getting up." -Midorima Shintarou.
RIP
Akashi's smile is so cute w hy
I'm telling you ! AKASHI is SASORI's brother !

Akashi is a complete monster, but I love it
Goddammit. Akashi's so darn badass his theme is sung by a bloody choir. Also: I freaking love Takao.
You have got to love Kuroko's fantastic sports animation - Takao+Midorima combo is just slick and satisfying to behold
