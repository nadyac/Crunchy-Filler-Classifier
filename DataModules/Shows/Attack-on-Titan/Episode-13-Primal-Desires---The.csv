Even vegetarians are Titans of the vegetable world... The world is cruel. As soon as I realized it my body stopped shaking.
Give me a few moments photoshopping 3D maneuver gear to a pig

@rubyimage : best picture ever

careful what you wish for

I was worried the Survey Corps would show up before Eren got the job done and attacked him.
Oh my fucking god I love your icon so much lolgstryker LOLOLOL

o wow the music jumped to another level this episode, it is as epic as the action now!
*slices titan's knee in half* how's you knee.
Mikasa and Armin are SO BADASS.
Daaaang I love this show!



Titan's train of thought: "must stop Eren from blocking hole..... or we doomed...... ah humans! must chase humans, mmmh, yummy".

i nearly died ... and i cried a little lol
i was like " Yeagar I was like "Go Yeagar!"
titans train of thought 1.eat that guy 2. eat the green eyed titan 3. why is the other titan coming towards me??? 4. AHH MY HEAAAAAAAAA....................]blood spats eveywhere] LOL
Only in Attack on Titian can you see a epic battle where the good guys win and still feel shitty. I love this show so much

I like how they made it look like the main character was dead for like 3 episodes. I had not seen that before.
I'm so glad you said that sarashi_and_spats. About NGE, I mean. IMO Attack on Titan has a number of clear influences from NGE.
Original Macross.. I find NGE rahxephon macross attack on titan etc are all takes on the grand story of outsider "alien" invaders attacking and being fought off honorable. This story concept goes back to the dawn of story telling.
Why does matt's comment have 3 downvotes?
Lol Eren with the boulder looks at the other titans and thinks "do you even lift?"
I guess Marco is only half the man he used to be.... I'm so sorry, I'll just leave now.
Half the time I watch this I don't know if I should be traumatized or laughing my butt off.
Dark humor at it's finest in this anime! It's put in subtly when you aren't expecting it and it takes you a second to figure out why you just laughed with all the messed up stuff that's happening to think "I am a terrible person." Glorious!
how did he even die?!?! im pretty sure I saw he make it back onto the wall with jean ...
with the new english dub we're going to have to deal with more marco died jokes. hopefully they'll be only half as bad now
Too soon XD
really tired of the way they treat eren
@sinned Thanks a lot Mr. Poop. You know one can figure a lot with that little detail. Manga readers please refrain from posting ANYTHING related to future chapters. I don't care how little it may be or how many F-ing warning one uses. Stop!

AND NOW MY FELLOW FANS, WE WAIT!
i don't know if i should thumbs up ur comment because i agree with you or thumbs down it cause i HATE WAITING ! * i did nothing *
Well, at least it's supposed to be a 2 week wait instead of 2-4 months like some others...
im waiting to see the titans manage to push the boulder...... dont deny it! u all know it gonna happen and erens gonna have to do somethin else
well actually... ;P
"Push the boulder?" You're thinking so small. The second half of these season is going to get way more epic than that!
Captain Levi appears to give negative fucks.

Guys general assumption is spoiler = spoiler for episodes not spoiler for the entire freaking series. So please, keep your knowledge to yourself. I have read the manga too but nothing is gained from flaunting manga knowledge.
So there's an AoT wikia...never read a wiki before watching or reading the series to the end, it WILL be spoiled for you. The info isn't even linear or in context. You'll know how it will end after reading only a few sentences.
haha Pixies scared me. Forgot I the countdown on my screen. Had my speakers on pretty loud with nothing on. Here I am minding my own business, next thing I hear "ROAAAAR!"
You know, he's an Enhancer.

Because they are scared of what they don't know AND because he did attack Mikasa
Its military logic. Hate on your biggest asset and stuff will get fixed.
The logic of "people are afraid of what they don't understand" x12894934 + Eren applies here.

hope you all like politics then..... "snickers"
no way that was 24 minutes
IKR felt like freaking 5 minutes .. when it ended i was like .. da hell ? it's over ALREADY ??!?!?!
I guess it's kind of like a lot of action animes. Recaps, filler, needless talking. makes for more episodes i guess. :/ I still like it!
17:35 of content. Pretty lame.
so much recap
HEICHOOOOOOOOO! I SCREAMED INTO MY PILLOW WHEN HE TURNED UP.
Who got the soundtrack? It is FLIPPING EPIC!
How can I get the OST?
I am definitely buying the OST...superiorly epic!!!! Question is.....where can we buy it? =]
The OST is ridic expensive though :/
I got mine from Nyaa.eu and it is absolutely amazing!
^ Other places you can buy the soundtrack include Amazon.com, Amazon Japan, Yes Asia, CD Japan...yes it'll be around $30, but it's SO worth it! (And $30 for a Japanese soundtrack is pretty standard.)
Yes. Ok i was crying when he sealed the hole in the wall. i was like HELL YES!! and the end. He finally joined the survey corps :DDD
idk, I kinda feel like the survey corps are mostly sociopaths...
That may be, but at least they're using those tendencies toward a good cause (killing Titans). I mean, Eren is a bit of a nut job, but it works because his genocidal hatred is reserved for Titans only. P:
Yea, i could of guessed pikinator lol
I think you'd have to be a sociopath to willingly go into a suicide mission and have a small chance of getting out alive, and even if you do get out alive, you'd have to live with the images of watching your friends get killed OTL
oppa would you rather watch as humanity everything you are everything we ever have been disappear like breath on a mirror the one thing i fear in this world is not death of a person or myself but the death of mankind
Ewww. A titan furball. Hack, yack, spew.
Yeah, I was like, 'ewwwww, GA-ROOSSSS!!'
That episode was pretty good, and it looks like we get 13.5 next week which means no new OP until Episode 14 ( 2 weeks ).
