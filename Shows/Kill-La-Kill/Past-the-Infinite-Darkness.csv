What a finale for a show that broke all the rules, even the ones made by itself! Pure fun and heartwarming galore! Thank you, Trigger, for showing how great Anime can be when its made from the heart!!!
@jadeakl How will there be a second season though? Senketsu burned up on re-entry. Unless the Life Fibers come back and try again, there wouldn't be another season. If they did, maybe they would try to remake Senketsu? Sorry, first comment
o7 Thank you, Trigger! Time to become depressed now that it is over =;(
I can't give this show more stars the damn button only allows 1.




Also, Guran Lagan.... Them feels.

Sadness of epic proportions...
That was sad and suprising, BUT DOES ANYBODY NOTICE THAT GAMAGOORI WAS FINALLY CALLED SENPAI BY MAKO?

I wish we couldve hear what junketsu sounded like. also It most likely known Senketsu is their fathers soul place inside the clothing
R.i.P Senketsu! who was neither Clothing Nor Human im eternally saddened
Its like karmina all over again T_T

@DoctorAron11 you realize you said Rest In Peace In Peace right?
"Ultimate Double Naked DT-Ahhhhhhh!" Well, at least they tried =/
At some point those two went from being a serious force in the show to being a naked joke.
At what point was the stripping teacher with glowing pink nipples and his army of naked people in bipedal weapons that did no damage considered a serious force?

I think it was cause the Mohawk guy made a badass entrance and he had to have gotten his weapons and training from elsewhere. Didn't think he was the strongest guy in the organization
i was surpprised they didn't go after the rubber protection barrier,as the only non-life fiber there they were the only one who shouldn't have auto-bounced,given the in show explanation. At least they got the last shot in.
It's been a great run Trigger, thank you!
I agree! I was cheering at the colossal animation work of Trigger
The Mako x Gamagori shipping is strong this episode.
I for one would be glad to watch another 24 episodes of just Ryuuko/Mako/Gamagoori love triangle shenanigans.
I really wanted Mako to kick Nui's ass after the Fall of Gamagoori. I'm storing it in my mental chamber of awesome anime moments that never happened.
To me,Mako want Ryuuko,Gama want Mako. friendly reciprocation in both cases. No idea who Ryuuko wants to end up with-though it might have been Senketsu. I think MakoxGama is more likely...Sat-chan gets her samuria and band leader! OT3
When the ending credit scene is up. Pause the video when you see the Elite Four. Gamagori x Mako.
Gamagori x mako, ryuuko x aikuro, satsuki x sanegayama, and inumuta x jakazura.
I know that for a lot of other shows this season, I openly wish for a second season, such as Engaged to the Unidentified, or a third season for Silver Spoon. In Kill la Kill's case, I hope it stays at one perfect season. It wrapped up well!
If they were to make a season two, I would want it to be in collaboration with Gainax. It would be about the life fibers attacking Earth. Life Fibers have all died out on Earth, so humanity must find a new weapon. SPIRAL POWER!!!
I would love a slice of life comedy. sort of Nurse Witch Komugi->Soul Taker,but as an actual continuation. Have Ryuuko occasionally do life thread stuff, but keeps it a secret/no one notices. Have the POV character rotate each ep.

@Akaruiyami I agree. But Senketsu has to be involved in one way or another.
@PonchoLeroy You do realize that trigger was founded by former members of Gainax, and has the director for Gurren Lagann employed?

Yeah she looked really good w/short hair, maybe an eyebrow wax, she's got rock lee brows!
Did you also see that blush when they were taking the group photo?
But she almost wouldn't be Satsuki without those eyebrows! Lol
So she said "Nee-chan" and not "nee-san"? I had trouble telling.
It was so sweet hearing Ryuko call Satsuki "Onee-chan". Mako looks cute & Satsuki looks even cuter with her new outfit & hair cut.

i didn't cry am I heartless probably

^yes
They killed Senketsu off like the brobot Chamber!!! T.T May they both rest in peace...
Chambers last words.... It made me shout in triumph, but at the same time a piece of my heart was ripped..,
UNICODE ERROR IN COMMENT
can we time skip back im sad

ragyo is finally done.
Ragyo might be done but she did say there will be others
That is the surprise in the OVA (25th episode)!
It's always difficult to express how great a show is... Kill la Kill is definitely the best of the Fall and Winter seasons. And I love how Satsuki changed by the end, and that awesome catch too!
Great way to clothes the series. It wore very well. The threads of the story were sewn into a wonderful conclusion.
Haters be hating, true, but there is a small point there. Ragyo said the Life Fibers would be back right before her...er...suicide. If Senketsu's gone, WTF is Earth supposed to do now?
Lol i dont think ive ever seen a comment be down voted this much. Though it is deserving of every down vote it's recieved
@R. Kitsune: Well, Ryuuko is still life fiber, so there is that...maybe she'll have Senketsu babies to defend the planet?
I agree, the clothing showed not only that you reap what you sew but also how much of a clothes-knit community they have become. Overall it was a great show.
Thank you for that orgasm
At first I watched for the booty now I watch for the plot.
lmao exactly!
At first I watched for the "plot", at the ending I was watching for the plot
IMA MISS NONON'S SEXY VOICE ;_;
everyone will miss her sexy voice!!!
[This comment has been removed]
@lurkinggood, Not the same actress actually (though they were similar enough that I thought it might have been her when I first heard her). Mayumi Shintani voiced Nonon, Satomi Arai voiced Kuroko.
Yeah, Satomi's voice is pretty peculiar as Mayumi's is. They certainly sound alike, though.
wait. thats Kuroko?! I KNEW I recognized that voice! Go Nonon!
I'm going to miss you Kill la Kill ;~;
It will be back for one more OVA in September!
the recap episode.
We will all miss you Kill la Kill TT^TT... aint no OVA going to be enough!
The OVa is a big surprise!
Hmmm .... A mountain of naked people in any other anime would be weird, but this is Kill La Kill!!!!!!!!!!
Having the entire KLK cast stark naked at the end is a norm that all anime should follow!
Anyone who sees a screencap of that without watching the series will totally get the wrong idea
What's ironic is the nudist beach guys have more clothing on than all the people on earth in the end XD
If you think about it, the only way kill la kill could have ever ended was with everyone getting naked.
Thank you Trigger, it's been one hell of a ride.
+825 and counting. Live long, TRIGGER!
I WILL BE THE DRIL....er... SCISSORS THAT WILL PIER... damn ... SLICE THE HEAVENS!!!!



5 minutes 5 more minutes 5 FUCKING MORE MINUTES MY BODY IS READY!
My body will never be ready.
Sleep: My brain says no, but my body says YES!
cant lie..this was great ah imma miss it so much. I ALreADY DO ugh
How cool would it have been if the emblem on the back of Ryuko was the Dai Gurren logo from TTGL :P. I seriously thought it was for a second and had to pause it to make sure.
MakoxRyuko, I ship it!
