If I had Shishio's health conditions I think I would live in an ice fortress instead of a fire one......
Creepy laugh while in pain, loves psychological manipulation, uses dirty fighting tactics and tricks...its official: Shishio is this anime's version of the Joker.
Some men just want to watch the world burn
Shishio & Yumi, a very tragic love indeed. This anime is not only great because of its fights, but also because of its character development.
For anyone wondering, the music that kicks in as Yumi Runs to Shishio is Sonata Pathetique 2nd Movement.
I never got to finish this arc. I've waited since 2nd grade to watch the rest of this anime. Bout damn time I watched that bastard burn.
Great memories, one of my favourite arcs
Damn... Houji is one crazy bastard.
Saito should've slayed his ass.
lol Shishio became a jinchuuriki
And OMG sorry about trolling but FU CartoonNet****k censorship, this battle lost like 5 mins with its moronic censorship lol Crunchyroll FTW
Unforgettable.
that woman is sick in the head
Say what you want about Shishio's character...at least he went out in a blaze of glory.
Probably should have used that move to begin with...
o_o Here I thought last episode was awesome. This one was even better! O_O
Evaporation doesn't work like that, he's more like a mistifier.
watching him go crazy was fun. boy he sure cant handle his lord losing
Wth with Yumi man.. Stoopid. Some tragic love story tho. Flip.

one of the most beautifully twisted anime scenes I have ever seen...what an amazing story with touching characters
