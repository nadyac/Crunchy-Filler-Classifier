Pre-psycho Madara was such a pleasant man xD
Such a touching story! they found a way to overcome the one thing keeping them from achieving their dream (there clan names) and ridding the area of the bloodshed is amazing. And to see the village being founded is so amazing.
Almost too pleasant...
He still is pleasant. Just not to Naruto, the leaf, the other villages, the world. But Obito.
ik i love him
@Ghab1 Obito said he doesn't consider him a friend, so no, not even to Obito
Madara brother looks like Sasuke

I thought the same, Myself. XD
ye but lot of brothers dont usually look alike anyway @eclipsed
@leilam12 - no, just no
I wonder what Madara would see if Sasuke showed up?
If only Madara stayed a nice man xD
Did anyone notice that Izuna, Madara's lil'brother, looks like Sasuke?
yeah maybe that little brother had a son
Tobirama's distrust was to blame for some things, but Izuna didn't help. Senju & Uchiha were both tired. Madara was ready to make peace w/Hashirama, but Izuna said no. Hash was the greatest healer to ever live, he'd have healed Izuna.
i enjoy this him
If only Danzo never existed..or at least if only he got raped earlier
Can you imagine? Fighting nonstop in countless battles and wars... The guys in Naruto's generation have no idea how lucky they are that they didn't have to fight when they were just kids. I'm glad that Hashirama created the village.
Well, Nagato's generation didn't know as much war as this one either. Remember, Nagato was born in the same overall generation as Kakashi, which had the Second (?) Shinobi War. This stuff is worse than that.
Actually, Nagato was born in the 4th's generation. Nagato is about the same as Minato if not a few years older since Nagato and crew were Jiraiya's first pupils imo.
Hopefully if Naruto gets Hokage he'll stop the wars :#
Nagato was from Ame, one of the tiny counties between the Big 5. He made Naruto aware that the small nations were the battlefield of every war & were poor, angry, hopeless. The Akatsuki were one result, Hanzo before & Orochi's Oto another.

Senju Hashirama- That's a real man right there. An ideal worth emulating. These flashbacks are among the best in the series and two of my favorite episodes in a long time. July 24th can't come soon enough.

Yeah, at that point in time Madara still had just a sliver of hope left in him and Hashirama's resolve spoke to that hope. It's too bad that sliver ended up destroyed as well.
Well said, orphenocou! =D
Of course, Madara could have let him die and then turned back on his word. With no one left that could match him in strength, Madara could have wiped the Senju off the planet. Hashirama wouldn't have been a hero than.
Now THAT was an awesome episode!
Awesome episode! See you all on the 24th!!! **(^O^)**
That's what, I believe, the true Fandom is like. It's not like We can do anything to change Dates and Times...so why not just sit back, and enjoy the ride rather than spit anger toward Our inadequacies to move the hands of time any quicker.
I don't understand what people are thinking... Flashbacks ain't fillers! They're interesting enough too. Anyway, have some guest passes! LYQCSLNLC9H UV9WTKF5TVW
Love you all!! :']
It's a known fact that you hear less from the happy people than from the unhappy ones, because we have nothing to complain about. Thus, all you SEE is whining and very little acceptance, despite the truth.
i would rather take break over filler too meaning i would prefer no episode this week instead of some shit filler that would disrupt the flow of this back-story
I feel bad for Madara... He finally agrees to the pact, but his clan gets shafted anyway. There was really no difference between Senju and Uchiha.. Neither were good nor evil.
No one is ever empirically good or evil. Everyone follows their own morals and ideals. Both Hitler and Mother Theresa ultimately did what they thought was right and good for their people. It's us who color them evil or saint with our morals
This isn't filler, this was in the manga It won't last for very long either
Flashback Fillers for anime: unrelated to the mangas original writings. Flashbacks Canon: Stuff that seems like an anime filler but it is not since it is really straight from the Manga original writings and does not deviate from overall.
Now-this flashback canon- not a filler or waste of time because it relates to Sasuke's decision to attack the leaf village or 2 save it. Like u deciding whether or not someone stole that pie so u want to hear the story first b4 u kill them
then there are people who don't want to be proven wrong saying 'filler'- U can use that word 'FILLER' 4 any definitions u want. & then there R the ADHD crowd who use it for hateful reasons. Original Story flashbacks from Manga R NOT Filler
Well said! Now let's find the guy who stole our pie!!!
This is not a filler, this is (very important) backstory. A filler has little to no bearing on the main storyline, just isolated stories. Backstory episodes explain/supplement the main story, and sometimes have overarching consequences.
Why do they keep skipping weeks they better release a double episode soon dammit ;__;
I don't really see how there is a comparison between people complaining about not getting an episode and people not sending money to charity in the first place.
explain why do people hate filler? i like all the filler i seen
This isn't a filler in the first place. It was in the manga.
there are never going to be any more double episodes. It has been years since they made the last one. Now we just new openings and endings but now that we got new of each I don't know why another gap week.
I believe it was 2 months ago the last double episode.
The tale of Young Hashirama and Young Madara continues!
I wish they made the episodes longer ;-;

Sorry, that just does not work here.
that joke is so old now
Lmao, that was as awful an attempt at a Joke if I've ever seen One. XD
This was a really awesome episode!!! So nice at the end
I would love to see a fight between Madara and Hashirama from start to finish. The fight here was awesome, but I wanna see the "Death match" between the two =P
I've been hoping for that since about around when Madara was reanimated, showed off his enormous power, and heard that Hashirama was the one who killed him. I've pretty much been "This fight has to be an episode someday!!!" since.
Well those two mad a very big hole in the earth, who would have thought.
Izuna looks like sasuke wtf
Yeah son! Another enlightening chapter in the epic saga! >.<
Oh my god, that was beautiful.
I'm pretty sure half of the people here only come for the guest pass.
no... >_> *cough* lol
pfft ha lol i didn't just receive a guest pass here 42 seconds ago
To be fair I did but I came for the show too I never pay for premium membership I only use guest passes. I'm not on long enough to pay for a full month that I'm only going to use 8 days in total. PS: Abuse the system use guest passes!
Willing to sacrifice yourself to stop all the fighting. You're a true bro Hashirama.
