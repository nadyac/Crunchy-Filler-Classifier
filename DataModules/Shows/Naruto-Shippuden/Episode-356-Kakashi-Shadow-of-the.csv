Kakashi used mean look! It's super effective!
lol I Know Ay
I thought Danzo's types were Assholery, and Douchebaggery...
I'll have to go re-watch Danzo's death.. I think that's the only way I'll calm down after watching his assholiness.
yamato look so girly here with long hair. Wonder if they tryna match kakashi with Tenzo. At first kakashi wont let the purple hair girl call him senpai but at the end he let yamato call him senpai. how kawaii <3
Finally we get Kakashi and Yamato's adult voices in the next episode and Itachi after 8 episodes of Kakashi: Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops, But I have loved the Kakashi and Yamato episodes and they are in the next episode to! Best filler acr
yea i was gonna say the chikara arc was really my fav, glad to know someone else thought it was number 1 filler.
Chikara was awesome! The end just threw me off a little bit.
I skipped the Chikara arc by mistake but didn't care at the time... I guess I'll watch it after all.

What episodes are the Chikara arc? Maybe I'll take a peek.
They should make a new version of wheres waldo...."WHERES YAMATO!" lol
I think that is called Naruto SD: Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals.
^ Accurate
Itachi too, is everybody on Kakashi's team?
We'll probably see the ramen guy too. SMH
Watch the ramen guy be the Kyros of the Anbu
itachi the best anbu there ever was
I wanna be the very best.. like no one ever was.
Finally, ANBU Itachi gets some screentime!

I LOVED THIS EPISODE ALOT!
umm did the 3rd hokage get shorter or is it just me? O_o
No like shorter than he was during the Chunin exams a decade in the future. No way was he that much shorter than Yamato when in that arc he was only like a foot shorter than Orochimaru. Inconsistent!!
totally! he's all Yoda sized talking to Danzo
Maybe he didnt wear his high heels that day ???
I was thinking that female shinobi tried to transform into lord third. but now im not sure.
Speaking of Sarutobi sensei, that was some pretty skillful politics he pulled. Put Danzo in his place and did it right in front of his own men - in his own turf.
Oh shit! it looks like we will be some Itachi in here! Instantly just got 1000% better
I dont consider character development as FILLER... although i would like to see some present time action , these stories are awesome , its cool to see why the characters act as they do now from when they did in the past..
I understand that some people just want the main story to move forward but this Arc is good. You can't put in the same boat this Arc with a random filler episode! A random filler episode provides nothing to the main story, not the case here
The problem is that we're not quite seeing the backstories of the characters as created by the writer, we're seeing the animators' idea of the backstories which means there are inconsistencies and things that just feel a bit...off.
This story arc, while not in the manga, fleshes out Kakashi & Tenzo's future friendship & explains why Team 7~ a walking Apocalypse waiting to happen was entrusted to him. Kakashi's faith in 'Yamamoto' is no longer a complete mystery. Nice.
Yamamoto has entrusted with team 7 because his wood-style can control the 9 Tails. Kakashi trusted him because they were old ANBU comrades. We already knew all that; this filler arc doesn't tell us anything new. It is fun to watch though.
Did Kakashi-sempai notice Yamato?
You win
no, but zetsu did
Danzo is so lucky the third hokage was soft on him... this is like his gazzilionth time he was on some bullshit.
well technically sasuke killed danzo like 9 or 10 times...i forget
That just makes it all the more satisfying ryujitsu
i liked how the fifth hokagie treated danzo like shit XD
Seeing anyone put Danzo in his place is always just so satisfying.
That exchange between the two at the end was rather entertaining.
YES ITACHI NEXT WEAK BABBY!
I'm loving these fillers actually it's a lot better then just making some crazy side stories or random missions like they did in the Naruto series, I feel a lot better watching through their past and seeing what each of them go through now
I don't really consider these fillers. They're past story arcs, and I love it, especially what's coming next. However, I can say that I'm itching to get back to the main story. Just don't put fillers in the past story arcs, it'll ruin it...
Just think of like a different series is airing while you're waiting for the next season.
Yeah, they could have totally made a spinoff series of Kakashi's anbu days. They could have even tied it in with the first movie.
These should be considered canon because Kishimoto is working with the anime studio.
more itachi to come!!! i love it!
Itachi-sama!!!! It's gonna be interesting after getting Yamato's backstory to see how Itachi-san got that sweet spot as an ANBU captain at 13 yrs old lol
Yes Itachi Sama is coming!

Yamato is such a beast. I wish the kid version had the eyes O.O
What's up with the girly eyes?Also, Oh the political pressure!
WOOOOO! More Kakashi and Yamato action!
their bromance is best bromance
Those foundation Shinobi can't be that good if everyone of them missed a running target. But I digress..
Or maybe they just wanted to lead them to Danzo so he can personally deal with them...
I guess they recently got a guest-instructor from the Imperial academy
or because Kakashi and Kinoe dodging skills are badass
Foundation ninja arent meant to be strong, they are sacrificial pawns.
Kakashi and Kinoe use Plot Armour... Attack Evaded.
It is a sad day when the filler episodes are running a week late.
Gai, Kakashi, Yamato, Itachi wow that would have been one incredible team!
I wonder why Danzo needs a cane to walk, I mean cmon!
Because it's hard to walk on a leg full of Sharingan eyes.
It's for deception; the same reason he has his arm and eye bandaged, to make it appear as though he is an invalid and disguise the fact that he's been messing around with forbidden justu and experimentation.
his legs dont have any sharingan
