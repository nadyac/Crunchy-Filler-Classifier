Heed Aoshi's warning, Kenshin.....
I'm lmao with the arguing between Yumi and Sano!
yay go jokes
that scythe woman is a man! t_t i though he was a woman the whole time. He has the same voice as Kenshin but an appearance of a woman. a good looking woman XD
So, Did you just not watch the first episode he was introduced? The woman that loves Shishio clearly called him a cross dressing queer or something along those lines...what did you think she meant?
If the voice acting is done by a woman, and the character looks like a woman, then the character IS a woman!
Yahiko,are you okay buddy? It seems you said that someone was sexier than Misao.I mean, it was a boy, but that's not the even the main problem here- you said that SOMEONE was sexier, I dont give a shit who they are,that is bullshit...
Man I am loving all these episodes!! this is what Anime is all about!!!

He better not. I have been wondering for a while now how far that wooden sword was going to get him.
