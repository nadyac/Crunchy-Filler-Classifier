Mephisto reminds me of Willy Wonka.
His full name is Mephisto Pheles.
i tots agree lol
Mephisto Pheles reminds me of Kisuke Urahara from bleach for some reason
He does remind me of Urahara! Probably the get up and the way he's portrayed in the opening. Goofy yet extremely lethal xD
i kept thinking he looked mighty familiar!!
I love the artists for this anime <3 * w *

It looks kinda like Ikuto xD
Fuck this show is even better a second time
indeed it is!
2nd time watching this seires
wow, so even demons have phones now a days...o_O
I'm more surprised that he's getting such great reception in hell... You would think he'd get no signal being under several layers of rock and magma with not a cell tower in sight.
Magic Reception?
I love it when Rin wears the hair clip.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not the only fangirl of that!
I just cant get enough of that opening Sax! If sexy were an instrument, id'd be the saxophone.
I AM SO FREAKEN HAPPY THAT I WATCHED THIS!! XD This is awsum!!
honestly i think rin and shiemi would look cute together

ahhh
the reason no one is reacting to the demon characteristics because when a human is tainted by a demon, they inherit demon-like qualities. That's why the director said that no one will be suspicious about his pointy ears and etc.

Ramune Soda! I want some too!
OMG that dude finally talked?!
Wish there were more episodes of blue Exorcist
I took a chance on this anime and ended up loving it!
nee is the most useful piece of broccoli i have ever seen

Whoa! The ending was totaly badass ^.~
Love This Show :3 I don't mind the ads. I just wish they were different and not all the same :/

This anime is so good. I'm able to marathon multiple episodes at a time, not just one or two.
i love blue exorcist i tjnk its better than naruto,one piece and bleach!!!!! HANDS DOWN
Honestly, I wish more people could appreciate real depth to story telling so that they'd put out more eps in animes like this one. I can understand how they appeal to the kids and they're a huge market though. I just want DEPTH please!

I don't know what you're talking about, rkaragon. Naruto and One Piece (Bleach I don't know) have some pretty deep topics and symbolism. If you can't see that, that's a shame because you're missing on something great. This one is also great
Of course, not all of it is deepness, but I hope you know what I mean.
I only respect Bleach and Naruto since they were my childhood shows. However, whether they are the "best" or not IS a person's OPINION, so no they aren't "getting ahead of themselves" or the like. It seems you take opinions way too serious
