wasn't that guy with the wok the perpetual genin?
I like seeing everyone's backstory too...this episode actually felt like legitimate backstory, the previous couple of episodes...almost felt like legitimate backstory.
I definitely smiled at seeing that old guy again. Who cares if that episode way back was filler: that oldest Genin had a couple awesome fight scenes.
Almost felt like legitimate back story? IT is legitimate back story, because it doesn't appear in the manga doesn't mean it isn't part of the story. It's at the writers digression to which source gets what material. Really good episode!
Like I wrote somewhere else, if Kishimoto is writing these stories then yes they are canon; the point of most filler episodes is that they are written by the animators not by the writer. I would not be the least bit surprised if this...
...entire episode was laid out by Kishimoto. The previous couple of episodes were still far above the quality of most filler episodes but had some details which didn't feel right so I expect Kishimoto was involved but maybe not as closely.
It's really weird how Kakashi had his child voice past his teens but Itachi has his adult voice at age 11.
Exactly! lol im glad im not the only one noticing all this!! xD
Itachi was always a bad ass
@DeadlyOats They have age inconsistencies in the Akatsuki too.
@DeadlyOats I don't think Kinoe\Tenzo\Yamato counted because of the mitigating circumstances surrounding his "recruitment" into the Foundation. Additionally, it could be they meant, "the youngest member to join under the Hokage."
I think he was 13 or 14 because they mention that it had been 3 years since Orochimaru escaped and Tenzo was still in the Foundation.
Who cares if Guy is lacking Darkness?! He is springing with YOUTH!
I'm enjoying it for now but its starting to drag. I think I could deal with a few more before it got annoying like maybe 3 more eps?
Plus he trained Rock Lee, who in the genjustu world steals and wears women's pants... Confused Yet?
Eternal Genin says, "I'm way past the springtime of my youth." Then he takes off running with all of that heavy equipment like some super athlete.
Kinda surprised at how honest Danzo was. I thought he'd just ignore guy, or act condescending. It's kind of weird seeing him act like a human.
Just like my Johnson!
OMG Guy getting shut down had me rollin.
@ssjews1980, that had me rolling too, getting rejected by the 3rd Hokage and especially Lord Danzo told him, his lack is DARKNESS..lol and you see Guy's face was like "WHOO" til he realized it at the end dat he's not about that Anbu life
I loved how it was Danzo who knew how to describe the qualification that he lacked but the 4th was being so polite.
lol the new opening should be renamed spoiler alert

Yeah. The opening is ridiculous with its spoilers. You could tell what's coming from some of the imagery. I liked the last OP song. This one could have been good, but it missed the mark because of that tone deaf singer.

I love the OP makes me excited for whats to come. And that Madara "Rape Face" @ 1:09 - 1:11 makes me excited to see the episode with this reaction animated
The songs only last around a minute and a half. One could always just skip the intro song.
Itachi needs his own spinoff.
Or they could rewrite the whole story and call it "Itachi" instead of "Naruto"
Aw a tween Itachi how cute <3
Itachi!!! I can hear all the fan girls screams from here
That is Itachi's best friend
Shisui the flicker or something like that right? Was supposed to be really fast or something? That's pretty much all I remember besides Itachi's friend.
you know those types of people you're watching a movie with and have to explain everything that goes over their head, it seems we have some of those people
you know those types of people who are petty and pick on people for asking questions, it seems we have some of those people ^
You know those types of people who comment about those types of people as they comment about those types of people? It seems we have some of those types here... (You know, this could go on and on...)

YAY Inoue and Riki are voicing Kakashi and Yamato again!
Next episode is gonna be gooooooooooooooooood
'You Lack Darkness' LOL!!!
There are lots spoilers in the opening song for those who haven't read the manga. At least it's not as bad as Pain arc's opening song.
Those spoilers aren't really spoilers until the people looking at them know they're spoilers.

I was hoping to see the Madara/First Hokage fight sometime but thats about the only major thing I saw. Since it happened in the past and the outcome is known I don't consider it a spoiler; more like animated awesome sauce.

i hope that wasn't Hinata.....
Yeah Its NaruHina <3
[This comment has been removed]
NaruHina, yay! Also, I have six episodes to watch and I'll be caught up.
NARUHINA FOREVER woot! woot!
New intro op!
yay I was waiting on it until it sucked then i was like cmon new op! xD
Well it might be a filler, but what the heck! I like how it displays the history in Naruto. So keep going with this
Maybe they'll be put in the new Naruto video game? They already have side stories about the origins of the "dark" Akatsuki and the story of Shisui Uchiha, so who knows?
I think they should do a spinoff with other characters doing real missions like this. Not many times do we see other ninjas get killed like we just seen.
There's a difference between filler and back story. This was genuine back story that "fills" the gap but stays on target with the main storyline. Actual filler is when they make up a story to drag out the main scenario.
That's exactly what this is though. This is anime only content, it's not established back story in the source material.
Apparently Kishimoto has actually been involved in this set of 'filler' which, if true, would make this both anime only and canon...unfortunately I don't think he was involved *enough* in the previous few episodes but this one felt legit.
There cannot be an episode dedicated to Itachi's younger ANBU life without those vital few minuets evolving Sasuke
The spoilers in the opening... I can't wait!!!
Best Filler Ever!!! YWFU7J59BGR UMKPCWB8KTN 4VG5QZEG48L enjoy!
