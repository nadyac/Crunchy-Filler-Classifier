"It's not the nose" "I didn't even say nose"
Bu lemme just pull this random item capable of stopping a bullet from under my shirt =_=
I thought that was hilarous - they managed to hit about every trope item in the bag (dirty magz instead of a bible)
lmao ikr i couldnt stop laughing.
I was expecting Sanglain to have cat magazines hidden under his shirt
That 60km/h thing, THAT 60km/h THING. Lmao
Exactly! ROFLMAO! I haven't laughed this hard at anything since, um episode 1 of this show.
i know right
Dude, the moment he stuck his arse out the window I seriously busted out laughing.
Y'know, I realize this show lacks in subtlety, but the guy marrying the little girl is named Nabakov? Or is that subtle...do people not know who Nabakov is?
enlighten us i am one of those who have no idea
To leave it simple, he's an author who's most known book is called "Lolita", I think you can figure out the rest
are you really surprised? haha love this little jokes
Thank you, I was trying to remember that. Not many would understand that joke though.
its those little jokes that make this show so fun. that and the cliche moments :p
"air-cat" FTW!
The princess is pretty sharp and really has it together for an 8 year-old.
Variation said 'Incognito can't do anything Official' anyone notice the irony? lol
Wouldent it be crazy if when kon gets sent home, every gets sent with him. I dont dont know why but that thought poped in my head.
dirty magazine armor...the ultimate defense lol
Yeah there no better armor than a stack of dirty magazines.
Comeing from gintoki i bealve it
Lmao
Variation, be careful peeking through doors next time XD
There was a censorship bar, and nobody's complained about it yet?
Or maybe his "Kon-fidence"
"Kon-tol" means penis in Indonesian language.
Did you honestly want to see that? I think everyone's lives are better being shielded from it lol
agreed, we don't need to see all to get what was going on
probably was made into the anime cause who wants to see honestly
started wondering if it really feels like that in 60km/h ...lol
They got those team rocket disguises lol
lol I tought the exact same thing. Variation even has a similar hair color as James xD.

you know what i relised,when he took a piss out from the sky.people are ganna be wondering what was that drip did they felt from the skies.theyll think its rain coming,but it was piss falling from the clouds lol
I've been wondering why do they refer to Erecpyle's group as the "Ulga Sorority" Sometimes the call it Incognito. So is the sorority a group that's over them? Would be kinda funny to refer to a group of men as a "Sorority".
The Ulga Sorority is that council you see with all those shadowy people talking. Incognito is one of the armed forces that answers to the Ulga Sorority. Any other questions?
Loving this show!
ok why did you not put another shot in there heads? Do you not fear zombies?
Don't forget he shot the pet too. The one whose bullet was blocked by a sheriff's badge
Variaton wasnt at fault, it was that nose!!!
Spoiler tags are very useful.
Mother of god this reeks of spoil.
ikr
Heh fun episode. Maybe we'll get some answers next episode... by the way, I've seen that nose somewhere before

Golden showers! 8P
