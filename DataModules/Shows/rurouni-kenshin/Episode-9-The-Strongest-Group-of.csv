That mid-air shirt rip was so manly it hurts
SUB FTW
Yeah! Way superior voice acting in Japanese.
the ending reminds me of Luffy invading Enies lobby to save robin
=)
Pleasantly surprised Sanosuke didn't get Worf'd this fight.
Just my thought.
I like how Sano called Megumi "missie" but that won't last. xD
thank god this is subbed. watching this dubbed should be a crime.
Why? The dubs are good, I prefer watching the subs, but the dubs by themselves are fine. Just not how I want to watch anime in my personal preference.
Seems like bringing Yahiko is a dangerous decision...
Nice Episode! A lot of actions, a lot of feels haha
