I hearby declare this episode Adorable.
Quite kawaii.
XD!!!!!!!Kawaii!!!!!!!XD
I want to see little Taichi so not kool heartseed men for leaving him out of the transition hmph
I can't get over little Inaban. Will there ever be a character who will live up to her after this series?!
took me the longest time to recognize the serious theme music that plays around 5:40. its the firelink shrine theme from dark souls.
"She even won Inaba over. Fourteen year old Nagase Iori is a monster." LMFAO
This is one of those eps when you start watching, and ask, "Did I accidentally skip an ep?" They're pretty adorable as little kids
When I finally realized what was going on at the beginning scene, my jaw literally dropped. I was like "No wayyyyyyy...."
Inaba together with Taichi, and kids in tow... Must be her nightmare and fantasy rolled into one!
Oh my Lord, the first few seconds I was thinking to myself: "Holy crap, they've been busy!"
Same here.

Hm, I have a bad feeling about Heartseed2. Heartseed1 is a jerk, but it seems like he has good intentions. Heartseed2 I just get the feeling is a bad guy.
Yeah it seems about time for a real antagonist to show up too
OMG loli Inaban cuteness level over 9000
Number Two, you crafty bastard.
This arc looks like it is going to be better than the last one. I'm glad.
Who else had a "Uunnnghh!" moment when Inaba turned into her 6 year-old self. And NEW ENDING!!!
*head banging to new end credits song*
Yeah, it is pretty catchy!:)
wow.. didn't know Tachi-kun has the "onii-chan" taste... wonder if he has a thing for his younger sister.. (> x <)
Siscon. Sister complex.
"Why did this sort of thing happen!?" Me: "Because it's interesting >D"
gaining interest again....
This was my favorite episode so far. But the ending with those hands and Taichi scare me. I think I'm the only one who's team Iori all the way
I'm on team Iori! I've been on her team ever since the beginning. But who Taichi picks is who he picks. So, I won't hate on Inaba if Taichi does pick her. ^.^
YES!! I finally found team Iori!!!
I'm on team Iori cause they're cute together. I feel like Inaba only like Taichi cause he was the first person to be friendly to her, she won't know it's real love until she has more of those bonds and then chooses Taichi over the others.
The ending is so much better than the other one...
Chibi Inaban! Wheee!
i'd love to see my girlfriend turned into a cute little girl too! umm... if i had a girlfriend that is ^_^;
This statement and the internet joke about ones hand being their girlfriend made me think of Midori Days. Sorry.
omg inaba moe level was over 9000!!!!
Kawaii!! Inaban <3
Taichi : How did we end up in this? Me: That's for me to ask!
