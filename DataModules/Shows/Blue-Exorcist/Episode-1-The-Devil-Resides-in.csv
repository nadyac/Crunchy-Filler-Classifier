Rin's mom has some explaining to do.....
it was a mother of a fall lol
2nd time watching this. gotta say one of my favorite animes
You should try the manga. Way better in my opinion (better as in the anime kinda strayed off from the manga).
^How often is this NOT the case?
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Code Geass (this is only because the anime came out before the manga in this case and thus is the canon stuff), I know there are a few other anime's as I've seen a few others but I forget.

Good and Funny XD

what?


for those of you just starting to watch...its a freakin awesome show...
I started watching cause my friend keeps going on about it being really cool. I hope you 2 are right. I ran out of anime to watch heh heh
I only started watching this because I was bored, but woah 0.0 <3
same
rin is hot.. just sayin
yeah he is... why is it that the majority of Anime guys are hotter then most guys in real life?
Because no one would watch if the majority of people looked like Gluttony.
@nana10101 OH REALLY? DID YOU THINK ALL ANIMES WERE BASED OFF OF REAL LIFE EVENTS? DID YOU HONESTLY EXPECT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE APLIED TO YOUR EVERDAY LIFE? YA KNOW, BECAUSE THATS WHAT ANIMES ARE. THEY TOTALLY ARENT FANTASIES.
Agreed. Did you know that they were planning to make it 25 episodes long, and go into all the characters' back-stories, but due to executive meddling, it got cut to 13?
*applied
Well, I read they're planning to release an Angel Beats Visual Novel
angel beats is a good anime
*clicks adblock* *clicks add* *is blocked*
ROFL the more realistic version of DEMON LORD DIAMO
lol, the Anime Orthodox Church is super serious about accessorizing.
3rd time watching this anime! I never get tired of it.
Wow... So apparently because i'm introverted i attract little demon fungus...? .____.
Me like! Nice, solid opening that definitely held my interest!
GYAHAHHAHHA OMG YAYAYAY 2PM TAKE OFF! READY READY READY FOR THE TAKE OFF~ lol love this song

Does anyone else have problems with it randomly skipping to the next episode even when you haven't finished the episode yet?
I've had that issue a few times, but its really rare that it happened to me. mostly during heavy traffic on super popular anime (AoT did it the worst and I think Yowapeda did it a couple of times if I tried to watch on monday)
it's the most annoying thing ever it happens everyother day for me
Turn of autoplay. It fixes it.
that moment when Crunchyroll messes up and starts ep 2 a few seconds into ep 1
watching it for the 2nd time~ Love this anime *^*
Man, apparently everyone has watched it more than once.... It must be really good.
Does anybody know the band and/or singer in the ending credits? Because I'm in love with that voice XD LOL
the beginning is slightly different from the manga version but its still awesome. summer just got better
