lol he dose not listen xD
hes not a baby he can go where he wants, that's just stupid. I wouldn't just stay put either
Tell me one time when someone said don't wander off and the other person listened.
You wouldn't wander if your favorite anime was in front of u... unless an ad showed up...
haha rins face when yukio asked him for help lol
nothing says friendship like shaking with shit splattered hands.
lol
It is nice to see how close to the manga the anime is
don't ruin your manga with your wired fluid XD hes your brother dude!
Hahaha you in for a surprise, BlackWings777. Or I think you already saw.
Lol at Rin's tail xD
Bed tail?
Rin is so kawaii! ^_^
that girl looks NOTHING like her mother!!!
Oi Oi! Come on now, are you trying to say she is fat?
....I agree with him
She does look like her Grandmother though .
maybe she takes after her father
LOL bad tail day! Also: Am I the only person who thinks it'd be weird to live with your YOUNGER twin, that's also your TEACHER? "did you do the homework I assigned?" Me: "Ummmm..... what was it again? ^_^'
Anyone else notice Rin got dressed before Yukio finished his sentence? Even I can't get dressed that quickly. Got to love anime time.
like how anime characters can somehow down an entire bowl of ramen in like a few seconds? Gotta love dat.
@Nature_Alchemist wait, ppl don't normally down whole bowls of ramen in seconds?
"Don't soak my manga with your weird fluid."
I hate eye juice on my books.
Rin is soooooooooo SEXY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I know right >_<
*Fangirl squeals*
fangirlism club for Rin starting today on facebook! lol
At my school, meh and meh buddies made a group. We are all fangirls, and we constantly talk about anime and squeal at pics of shirtless anime characters rofl
All the girls seem to think Yukio's such a stud, but meanwhile I find Rin much more attractive...

ANIPLEX has a talent for pumping out good shows from the first time I watched this I had a new favorite anime though admittedly I have a LONG list of favorites hehe
Almost every anime ive watched has been by Aniplex and Funimation. Gotta love dem rofl
I've see A Lot from both Aniplex and Funimation and OMG I Love 95% of all I've seen so far...... there is one more it starts with a G they're good to
Starts with a G. Could you be mentioning Gainax?
I like Rin's tail.....
That's a given
i hate it when the advertisements are LOUDER then the audio thats playing on the show...it REALLY hurts my ears...i already deal with that shit on tv i don't wanna deal with it here!
Adblock on Google Chrome. <3 Just giving some advice. Eventhough this comment is old xD
PXL8GHZJRW7 or how about a guest pass?
OR you could, you know, support Crunchyroll by paying monthly instead of taking away from them through Adblock.
That was a very sweet episode. Rin crys reading Yukio's manga, now that's funny.
I dig this show! And holy crap, I want to rock a white-girls-in-the-club bun when I'm 80!!
Thats why you wear shoes when you walk in the garden
rin is so cute, ahahahha!
Oddly a cute anime I love the opening theme so much, so jazzy, gotta learn that song~ But I swear, with every crunchyroll episode, I'm being brainwashed into buying Catherine.
I love Rin he's freakin aboreable!
