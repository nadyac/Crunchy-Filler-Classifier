A show about ninjas, but they taking the SAT?
@Kurouga what if the other two doesn't do the 50-50 for the member with Hyuuga to do the 0? They could also each think about 30-30- Hyuuga 40, another one could think about 50-50.
The obvious answer is for everyone to do nothing. Nothing can be below a 0 point average, so everyone wins.
@Jvdisme That's not the obvious answer at all because "every wins" isn't the ideal scenario. Everyone benefits from having fewer rivals in the second portion of the exam, so they're attempting to make sure others fail while they succeed.

im with @yui on this if everyone wins you will have a massacre for the second round, resulting in far more deaths and casualties than usual
Filler isn't that bad, but what is bad is that I no longer feel the energy and excitement I had for the next main episode because the main episode's momentum has been lost with all the filler.
sucks for you.
Main plotline? What's that taste like?
Funny thing is, there are some characters *Sakura* I'd actually like more if this filler had come in chronological order. And Neji's death would have felt wrong, instead of like nothing. I love these eps, but they're in the wrong place.
Hi every one, I want this Tshirt design, please help me bring it back http://teespring.com/naruto700th
Shikamaru is such a beast! Enjoy WMB6SKCVWJS
Thanks Harry
QNCPDLNQBV6 RNBF99HDCYQ i had 2 scrubs
TRE8LP5AZXB SY7UYFM5Y9Y 2 here as well
NO... I don't want no scrubs!
^ WOW does that bring back memories! Another kid from the late 80's/early90's?
The answer is... Naruto.
Unfortunate but true
this is turning out to be a pretty good filler
No, this totally breaks up the excitement of Naruto getting Kurama sucked out of him. In the manga, it's boom, boom, boom, everything is happening so fast because Naruto is about to die. This filler arc totally ruins the momentum.
So true
I agree with You Guys...Sigh...I guess We're just going to have to muscle through it...
@yuiismywaifu I had almost forgotten he died, and then you had to go and remind me... Why do you do this to me? :'(
I couldn't help but think that Shikamaru should have let that fight happen. Would've been hilarious.
Shikamaru you glorious genius of a bastard

Good thinking Neji. Whoever abandons their comrade is scum! Round 2 next!
It's weird watching characters you know will die later on in the story.

And... Danzo's good side! Lol. Love this filler!
Not really good side IMHO.. more like his Dere side
Awww, I really missed this childish quibbling between Naruto and Sasuke.
Neji you magnificent bastard.
Is it just me or was round one pretty much tailored to ensure that Shikamaru's team would pass?
"ME" I LOOLED so hard at this part :') I luv Naruto~ <3
Neji living up to his genius name. Good job!
Yeah.... Too bad he isn't living any more. :/
Too soon.
