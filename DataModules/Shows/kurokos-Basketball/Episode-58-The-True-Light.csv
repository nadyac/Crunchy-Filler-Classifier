Same. Also picking. Did you notice the coach coaching for once? Still waiting for fouls and timeouts to slow dominant players and to change pace of game. There is quite a bit more strategy in the game than they show.
well if you're going to say that, people don't have super powers and it'd be impossible for someone as good as kuroko to go unnoticed. it's a fucking anime guys, take your logic elsewhere!
Didn't they use the foul strategy vs aomine ?
although it's understandable to want to compare something you're involved with irl with a show... but its basically that, a show (anime to be precise). Make the comparisons if you must, but don't forget to have fun & enjoy the show.
Yep if this was a war anime we all know Kise would die.



I'm sure that if they ever show Kuroko getting a nosebleed, the girls watching this show will follow suit.
Furihata finally got a chance to play. I'd say he did fairly well.
"Mad men make mad interceptions!" ....I actually like that one.
Damn, Aomine's asking the hard hitting questions today
Yes! Finally! Left the browser open until I heard Kuroko-noises. XD
Hahaha Is that English? Can I eat it?? Furi...thank you for that!
He"s thinking of that Japanese Lunch Time Rush
When everyone didn't notice Izuki's puns lol
KITAKOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW LONG I'VE WAITED FOR EAGLE SPEAR
Dang Aomine, that was deep
@crunchyroll why is kuroko delayed by 2 episodes...??
Unfortunately, it was the condition set when they were given rights to Kuroko no B asket. The reasons, I don't know. Crunchyroll is probably as frustrated as you.
I wonder how Kuroko would be like if he got in the zone.
ughhhhh! I'm so torn! I love Seirin but I love Kaijo too! It's like watching two best friends fight - it ain't right Dx
