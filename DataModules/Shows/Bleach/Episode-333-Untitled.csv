there breaking through the sky again Damn it! do they know how it that takes to fix a sky. no i guess not it takes a whole lot of time and a shit load of crazy glue.
If chicken little was here he would pass out or something, I don't even know.
I love the fact that byakuya was on fire for more than 20 seconds and his hair was still intact lolz XD
that is pretty ridiculous
Noble hair...
Dumb question but, near the beginning of teh anime series or some where in the series wasn't the mention of a secret sqaud zero supposed to exist?
It's not a secret, Squad Zero is the Royal Guard, it's the guys who guard the king (the guy Aizen was gonna kill)
lol kaitou
Yeah.. They never show up in the anime, unfortunately, but they are a big part of the current arc in the manga.
When the Captain Commander tells you to stay back, you better stay the hell back!
he shows up, basically calls Nozomi a b**ch twice, then makes Con his b**ch with just a look
Brats
Recap ends at 3:30
Thank
how ironic, a cleaning detergence commercial on bleach
detergent*
I've been wondering for a while now, how do you guys think the average citizens of Karakura Town are handling this? What with the explosions, buildings being sliced to pieces, etc.
and holy crap why are the freaking cops still not there?
They can't see what's happening, that's why. It would just be another "natural disasters"
Karakura town has a lot of "natural disasters"
i think a one-on-one between Nozimo and Ukitake would be like an endless game of catch
lol
I've only been watching this Arc for the 10th anniversary ending theme, it's a good recap of the series
Now I understand how wildfires get started......Yamamoto I didn't know you visited the world of the living so frequently! <3
Nozomi is such a bad-ass, I'm loving her all the more! Who woulda thought that little Mod soul had that much power
bring crunchyroll to xbox already! that hulu stuff sucks!
Catching up Indeed I am.
does anyone else remember how when they were fighting the arrancar their powers were restricted so they didn't cause any irreparable damage to the real word, what happened to that?
well did you remember that the Research and Development Unit controls that power also known as the Kenten Kigou so if they were to use it they would have to ask the dude in capt. Myuri's lab and of course he would say no but then again....
They didn't come through the seikaimon normally with all thats been going on and it wasn't stated that the senkaimon was restricting their powers when they went through still since the Arancarr arc. So they might not even be restricted.
yes getting back into the swing of a bleach watch a thon!

God I love these 10 year anniversary endings
ICHIGOO!! REMEMBER WHAT NEL TOLD YOU!! YOURE IMPOTENT SO DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT NOZOMI!!
JK but he wouldn't have to worry about kids.
what happened to Nel anyway?
I woner if she asorbed all main soul reapers power even head captain how strong it would be, you can not say her sword is not cool
Nozimo's sword can only can take so much spirit energy. she cant take in anymore after her whole blade is lit with a pinkish purple light
