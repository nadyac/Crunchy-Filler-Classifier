I love any of the episodes where Kurotsuchi has a big part. He's like Hannibal Lecter and the Joker in one.
Note to self: Never piss off Captain Kurotsuchi.
Although Kurotsuchi's move was epic, I think it would've been more fun if it was the actual Reigai, that rebelled against Kageroza :3
what a episode I call this mind fuck
Bleach always have the best fillers ^U^ Except for the bount arc -.- That was dreadful...
Oh shit It was so long since i watched bleach i frogot about returning to the Bount arch i stopped at the filler before that and that was it thx Dikila btw for anybody who is wondering why this filler is awsome because Capt. Kurosutchi was!
only problem with bleach filler is its great to a point then they drag it out to long WAY TO LONG which takes the amazingness of it just being fillers and tosses it in the trash can.
the most horrifiying thing, pissing off captain kurotsuchi.
...Am I REALLY the only one who saw Nozomi's being a Mod Soul coming, like, a LONG time ago?
I assumed she was right from the start when she came through. I missed the "What is she memo" I guess. >.<!
Kuro is being crazy awesome. It's an interesting step...That was also interesting. Purple, huh? Give Kon a proper body - he's got a potential girlfriend . And yeah, I get that was bad for you, but, still, say something sooner!
LOL MAYURI IS FRIGGIN AWESOME hahaha
@3:33, Best bad-ass one-liner from a captain to date.
Agreed with Chao Sweetie. the manga has taken a rather dissappointing turn due to the result of the fight vs aizen. will be intresting to see where it ends up but i have to say.. its odd that a filler arc surpasses the origonal content.
damn byakuya an his pride
Officially mind fucked!.....
I KNEW IT SOI FON IS LESBIAN LMAO
Only now you know ppl knew from since the first fight they had when she was Naggin about why yorichi left her for 1 century lol and not taking her with her or did you skip that ep lol
Watch and learn. This is how you make a god damn filler arc. LOL
this isn't how you make a god damn filler this is how you make a GOD DAMN EPIC FILLER
naruto should take notes
This arc is pretty good... better then the crap thats in the manga now.
YESS.
At first, I thought his cliche laugh at the end was stupid. Then I thought about it, and I'm like, "Evil Scientists. Whaddaya gon do 'bouts it?"
I like the end of this episode...That's exactly how my mind was. Mind = Blown
whoah mind blower! who would have thought
