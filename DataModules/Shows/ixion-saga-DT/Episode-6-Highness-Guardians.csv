'Go into a wad of tissue and stop existing!' holy crap Marian is the coolest trap ever.
I'm pretty confused. So do Kon and Marian havea thing going on now? Since he lost his virginity to her...
Yes, they're getting married now.
Nope: 5:33 he says "get back to the real world so I can stop being a virgin."
After the ending theme of the last episode, during the preview, the mention that Kon's virginity is still intact.

In this world Menstruation comes in 3 stages i guess. When the third stage comes you bleed from your eyes and go attacking villagers like a rampaging 9 tail fox. Instead a 3 Cowlick Princess. I wounder if a 9 exists?
crawl back into your fathers balls and rethink things.. !!! i'm so gonna say that to someone... someday.
