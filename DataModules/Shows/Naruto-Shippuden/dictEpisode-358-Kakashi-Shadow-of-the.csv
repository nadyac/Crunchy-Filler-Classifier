clearly isnt dead love just rip eyeballs out like cutting fingernails opening song whose hands holding each others im thinking hinata naruto why did cry another reason hate danzo just about post same comment god so much hate danzo too weak bring hidden leaf down him shisui itachi both so shrewd represent power potential uchiha danzo hindered growth hidden leaf by huge extent being so harsh uchiha know his such an asshole im so happy got raped by sasuke two old advisors were thirds teammates back just genin just like danzo ninjas whove serving konoha ever since second hokage only two generation still alive fact can just call these anbu black ops episodes douchebagdanzoepisodes coz thats all im seeing damn trading eyeballs seems so easy guys ill trade left brown coloured eye green one pls medical science hasnt come up way transplant whole eyes yet unfortunately right no would reestablish optic nerve plus hope axons foreign eye would regrow correct alignment given neurotropic factors around mediate its growth which unlikely adults listen dont want read news some kids went blind cause thought could trade eyeballs each other so please do not try home these fictional characters trading fictional eyeballs each other sure will give sharigan blue contact lens plus black eye green eyes but yeah might do depends like your specific brown eye not ok seriously wtf danzo just stealing uchihas sharingan willy nilly could possibly help village danzo hands down biggest dick anime eyes power takes while before its ready use again sasuke lucked out used white zetsu kage summit wasnt ready wen battled saskue griffith berserk bigger dick danzo wasnt about tht life thts why go tht jerk could possibly help village what dont think being able manipulate anybody want without noticing could come handy someone like danzo shisui itachi two favorite uchihas shisui nvr got mangekyo say kuz genjustsu power just an ability his eyes know diff eyes diff abilities now say kuz scene episode mangekyo itachis eyes changing its just an intense emotional experience think mangekyo little like super saiyen activation mangekyo activates user feels extreme amount emotional distress personally believe its guilt causes activate assume itachi felt guilty let shisui commit suicide sasuke felt guilty its bought by intense emotion itachi initially said sasuke come same eyes mention needs watch his closest friend die but havent really touched shisui too much ever noticed shisui alaways alone like none his familylets talk about tht xd hit nail head sympathy itachi reached 9000 died truth reveiled danzo hope lord enma tortures him eternity sasuke vs danzo fight episode 209 feel an urge see danzo destroyed again those were days back sasuke badass ty lol will im really diggin all clarification really exposes depth last battle going manga ending soon might last filler arc dont mind drags bit more especially since probably best filler arc all naruto what makes think will ending soon all know might an expansion kind like sequel good movie which ends up destroying all its legacy kuz just bad lol reminds dragonball evolution closest thing almost kill goku permanently lol best filler arc lee racing his hands eating curry life not serious this comment removed really liked itachis mom came see naruto hospital found pretty cool friends kushina revealed backstory kushina uzumaki bit problem though does know which one kushinas wasnt birth whole thing top secret pretty sure knew minato goldenblonde hair naruto battlefield after attack tails alone his parents diedleading everyone else would know people knew about naruto hints why given hard time his younger years third narutos mom died so never left alone f~~~ danzo boggles mind lived so long hate danzo also but looks like 3rd danzo two sides same person danzo does dirty work 3rd cant bring him self do but wants do am inclined agree nbu01 thats why both own anbu forces danzo one evil sob but gets shit done hiruzen sarutobi doesnt guts do bad times dont last but bad guys do always think quote whenever danzo mentioned ill give danzo some hard stuff done but no denying orochimaru his greedy ass were themselves using village an excuse danzo sharingan before uchiha died think about think saved all eyes uchina clan died because one episode all over himor tht someone else so next week were gonna see obito show up talk itachi god clears so much shit up like what didnt get much read backstory itachi really get yes most certainly needed understand history uchiha its members involvement konoha understand epi such itachis mangekyo sharingan awoke what uchihas lives were like after kyuubi attack also shisui died etc etc not clear tobi person behind nine tails incident fought yondaime while its clear kakashi still young time therefore relatively obito well sucks third hokage really pisses off just lets danzo walk all over him all time just let orochimaru go after murdered many peoplehe even suspicions long before actually found out blood his hands this comment removed kakashi would good hokage can do dirty work still peace mind will create peace yeah too bad hes not interested honest someone who isnt actively after job just one more point favor means arent power hungry least 100% agreed about 3rd lets danzo walk all over him especially tried assassinate 3rd think reason why gets away because two idiots council listen danzo youre kind right but remember said owed him one danzo let kinoetenzoyamato free hes type feel guilty got hokage title over his friend plus half time hes outvoted by his counselors itachi kept danzo check always good ep itachi should danzo death flashback every episode like every angle slow mo alternate deaths one bloodier one would awesome bring back shorts ends episodes put different character kill him every episode starting gai would amazing would pay tht what boss episode agreed like finally explained where uchiha clan during tails attack man love itachi no homo also shisui awesome hoping bit more back story him do wish could seem ore shisui barely know poor guy so important hes main character new naruto video game coming out later year sarutobi just bad danzo since allowed danzo do all stuff why didnt itachi snitch because itachi understands danzo danzo not evil like people making him out hes simply acting leafs best interest danzo an anachronism dark age shinobi history personally think during time itachi spent kakashi during anbu days really shaped his life one good guys till end not think wouldve kept following danzo depths hell watch out here comes danzo hates really miss main story now always what theres war going present time eh think really adds now see naruto telling bad guys off youll appreciate his determination an optimism knowing fucked up history konoha ninja world except making all stuff up none actually happened already knew messed up stuff actually happened wed know even more just tell fucking story showed backstory everything right away naruto would move too slowly its much more interesting leave few holes then expound become relevant
