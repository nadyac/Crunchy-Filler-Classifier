This anime would typically not have been more then a one or two episode preview. However something about this dumb show has me hooked and I find myself tuning in every week.
This exactly.
haha, yep. That's how Gintama got me!
Gintama seemed too long for me to even review it. But looking as how i first saw at this show, it looked stupid, now i'm hooked. I willing to try anything, perhaps Gintama now that you mention it. Thanks!
Same here.
So stupid but funny!
for some reason my mind keeps repeating "anpan,anpan,anpan"
That's from Ginta.... Anpan
Awesome Gintama reference, friggen yamazaki....This show really fails to elicit the emotional rollercoaster of Gintama though. I hope new episodes come soon...
from Nagi, ( clannad )

Anpan. Anpan. Anpan. Anpan. Anpan. DARN IT YAMAZAKI STOP GETTING THESE THINGS STUCK IN MY MIND
is it weird that when the episode starts with DT I sing it along xD
Erec laughing like Shaco I like this.
Shaco from league of legends right ahahha.
so depressing, even though we know they are still alive
Last episode .... nooooooooooo....I think we're being trolled.
definitely being trolled
I feel like this took the place of Gintama,...at least until it comes back.
wow this anime is a bit surprising and a bit strange too. But over all its strangely addicting to watch.
stupid mirror trick probably lol. crazy ep
Haven't checked next season's line up yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if next episode is not the final. lol This series has a way of messing with us. >_>

Well technically their bodies were like incinerated. That's why he said something like "though your mortal bodies may be gone".
We've seen that the animal on the team is something more. Weapons transforming and no discrimination against transsexuals. Anything is possible in this world...and that is also why I'm still watching. I know it will become awesome.
I wish i knew what it was about this show that keeps me watching.
I feel like we're being trolled super hard right now...O_o

Oh Gustave, you silly
He's a man, he's a man, he's a man..
@brotheryang17 because, why would you do anything else with your time?

Still gotta love the opening song... xD
KT and Gustave actually appeared to feel sorry for them at the end. I would have probably cried too if i thought it was real.
Can someone please tell me the name of the piano song that is played at the end of the episode right before the credits?
