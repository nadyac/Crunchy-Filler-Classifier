lmao she collapsed..
There's something about the 'new' Bleach that has me wanting more each time I finish an episode. Before I really enjoyed the show, and then I lost my love for it.. but now my love's rekindled and burning bright. I can't wait to watch more!
This is exactly what I was thinking!
I also enjoyed the previous style but after like episode 180-200 I lost my interest in Bleach but now... I'm hooked once again.


Recap over 2:26
Orihime's new boobs are greater than Tatsuki's new mullet.
Don't you mean the other way around, that mullet is a force to be reckoned with? Then again in regards to Orihime, the party is in the front rather than the back...
Lol , Riruka's reaction when she saw Ichigo , Priceless .
I know where the heart goes Ginjo... Kingdom Hearts >_<
@megaton, what do you mean ichigo doesnt need his hollow? if it werent for his hollow then he would be dead... 15+ times over.
I really like the slow pace of the story. For an anime that's known for its big fights, this is an interesting departure. It seems more serious and slightly more "grown up". I guess the audience has grown up since the start of the series.
But I loved the fights D: This new story is making me sad T.T
I feel like Soul Society is not going to be happy when Ichigo pops back up on their radar.
They'll probably be like; "Its nice to have Ichigo gone..." "Ichi comes on the radar again." "DAMNIT IT ALL!
I think it'll be more like, "Oh shit!! Lock the Seieti!!! (please excuse the spelling)
They'll need him again for whats to come. Seriously.
Dude I want that Fullbring ability. So many applications, so little time.
I feel so bad for Orihime T_T
What makes me really sad, is that I most likely wont be hearing Ichigo say, "Getsuga Tensho" anytime soon.
Where the hell did Kon disappear to?? Bleach needs to fix up on this, they just seem to get rid of characters, Nel is another case. Still love Bleach don't get me wrong
he must be at the dude store or back in soul society sense he no use to ichigo any more
"Want something to drink?" *DEATH GLARE* LMFAO.

You jerk......
lol
No! It is IchiRuki! None of this Orihime business. It's clear he will never recognize her sex appeal, anyway! So ha
maybe he prefers flat chested girls LOL
Who'd want a flat chested 50+ year old woman?
renji
shes a lot more than 50+ she said in the beginning she lived 5 lifetimes so shes probably 450+
Riruka.. rukia.. ran out of ideas kubo?
His necklace transformed into a sword, bye bye conservation of mass law
i wonder what nel is doing?
her and grimmjow are probably still unconscious in the sand
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I WANT MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!!
