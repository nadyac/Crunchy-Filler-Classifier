Perhaps the seed will produce a plant that will produce an egg and Kemokemo will be born again.
You and me both!
I loved kemokemo when he first appeared, and i heard it was cannon so it was possible he could have become part of fairy tail but the common sense in me knew this would happen.

this is kinda a sad episode. damn lol
I know!!!!
I feel very depressed yet happy, darn it
It's been a while since I cried over fairy tail, but dame this was a good one.
Finally I will be able to see Laxus.
I can't wait to see him
all I can say about the ending credits is... yummy
umm.. wheres that tail coming from?
Yeah hahaha, it looks like it comes from the actual asshole, because we see the crack above it. Normally it should be positioned at the asscrack. The pic was hot anyway though.
she's not actually a cat girl tho, I am pretty sure she is just human wearing cat stuff because she loves cats.
The tail was the focus of your attention?
Everyone knows that Girl with Ears & Tail > Normal Girl. Actually that > should be maybe 100 > to at least give it the proper scale of how much more amazing they are.
OI you guys series?! She's not a "cat girl". She is just wearing them -_- ... the tail is attached to some pant.

I'm so glad I wasn't the only one who thought that.
just have to say the title of this episode i was already have bad thought ><

Because he took a page from Mario and learned how to be a fire flower
The "God of Plants" thing was a general term applied to him. Kemokemo was a purifier, his body absorbed and neutralized the virus while his breath was used to kill anything that could spread the virus off the island (I.E. the Sea Serpent).
Or see it like this; to rule over something you should be able to exterminate it... Make any sense?
If a filler episode made me cry, I don't wanna know what'll happen when Tartarus arc starts...
You'll be bawling.
accept its not even a filler. its from the second fairy tail light novel
@CronicManga That's useful info
i cried manly tears !!!
I decided to watching this after beating Ori and the Blind Forest to cheer myself up... I'm still sad now.
wow im actually crying
God are any of you even really fans? This isn't even a filler. It's from the Second Light novel. We established this in the comments as soon as the ark started. Don't complain just because you didn't like it, because others of us enjoyed it
ikr, there's like 2 more episodes left and then we're back to the main story at the beginning of April.
I knew the snow globe and other one weren't filler (but not story canon either) but I didn't know this was too. That's pretty cool.

The hell do you mean "not story canon either". The story were canon. It just come out as in extra chapter (2 per week) that doesn't make it non-canon. Fairy tail barely has any non-canon stuff. (The clock arc was canon too
why can't I ever find a wallpaper of the pictures at the end?
Is it just me or Kemokemo look like one the the large monsters that you see is on tenrou island (near Mavis??) in the training for GMG ova?

I honestly thought kemokemo was going to be involved in something a little more drawn out... only took 2 episodes lol
You were a good plant Kemokemo.
