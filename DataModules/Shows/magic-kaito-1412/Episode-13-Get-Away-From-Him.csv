That op is epic as hell! Considering the fact this isn't really an action anime or anything, they made Kaito look like a badass and the tune was great. Anyone know what the song is called?

agreed he is a badass smooth operating pimpish illusionist.

Conan's mystery solving is awesome and interesting in it's own right, but I just love watching Kaito show off.
And Kaito successfully pulled off Da Flippity Flop, which is not an easy ski movie to do.
I have no idea why I enjoy this show so much considering how cheesy it is but I do. So glad crunchy picked this up.
So glad I can watch Magic Kaito on Crunchyroll now, I hate waiting a week for subs.
I totally agree. This is such a relief.
I can finally relax on watching Magic Kaito 1412, Plus I LOVE MAGIC!!! :3
Kaito is fearless, dressing up as his alter ego to ski fabulously.
As smooth as ever. I bet his proposal to Aoko would be really romantic when it happens XP
Akako is so fucking awesome period
Akako is like Ai from detective conan. Doomed to be the girl never chosen because of childhood friend.
I totally ship Aoko and Kaito!
I think there is a Nakamori who can catch the Kid
And it won't be Ginzo, My side effect tells me so.
YOU. It s you people who make me smile but also damn you
I hope this show just keeps going like Case Closed/Detective Conan.
There's not enough source content. There are 33 chapters of Magic Kaito and over 916 chapters of Detective Conan. Magic Kaito, the Manga, is effectively over and has been since 1994.
Silly @Rosyna then they write their own. It is not uncommon that an anime adaptation strays from the manga. Just look at Akame ga Kill.
Please don't remind me of how they butchered that show. @LeMicroKill
I hope Magic Kaito continues, but not to the level of DC. Conan NEEDS plot progression- I don't even remember the last time we saw Kudo onscreen, or any mention of the BO.
Oh man I totally ship Aoko and Kaito now
i miss the old op it was so good! =(
Very Nice episode
never know being a chick magnet meant women would keep running into you while skiing.
Two things stand out to me in this episode. How is it Kaito can ski so well but is crap at ice skating? Having done both, skiing felt like an advance form of skating. Also, WOW the animation is a major improvement over the first seasons. =D
I'm a wicket ice skater but I can't ski to save my life. And I know people that can ski but can't skate. To different skill sets and balance requirements. Besides it's like anything, if you never learned...

The feathers at the end of the intro reminded me of D.N.Angel
...Kaito...do...a...Barrel Roll
Well the OP has pretty much confirmed there will be more Conan Crossovers, which is always nice.
Man, Kaito has some real cajones when it comes to dressing up as his alter-ego in public.
time for the third time i see that crystal mother episode
