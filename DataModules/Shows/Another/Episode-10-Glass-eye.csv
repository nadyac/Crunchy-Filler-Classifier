Thank goodness I decided to watch this series AFTER all of the episodes came out
Agreed. The cliff hangers of this anime are brutal. I nearly took a sick day just to finish up the series. Thank Truth it only has 12 episodes. If this series was Naruto-sized, I would totally lose my job over it.
@Ouma_Shu_ 911 is mostly only used in the Americas. Rest of the world uses other numbers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/119_%28emergency_tele
Same thing happened to me. I would've hated waiting for each episode to come out.
I started it a while ago and lost interest by episode 2. Now Im watching it a few years later and yah.... waiting for this weekly would have been....killer...
^^ Same for me.

Just tell them! Tell them who it is and stop taking three-second pauses between your words! You're killing them! D:<
literally XD
But what if it gets her because she tries to say something?
OOOOHH!! I get why the anime's called Another now. Extra Student..Another... I'm slow >_<
isn't anata also a term of endearment to loved ones?
its anaza. the last character is za not ta.
"Anaza" is just the romanization of Another. Engrish if you will.
Another one bites the dust!
Honestly, I don't think I would have ever realized that if you hadn't told us. I'm pretty stupid..

lol i thought the same thing
The thought crossed my mind, but this isn't really that kind of anime.
MISAKI! WHAT DOES THE FAKE EYE SAY ABOUT HIS DEAD LEVELS!!! ITS OVER 9000!!!

... Why doent she use her eye to guess the dead person? o.O...
That comment... it made my day...

This is just amazing. I had to make a rule for myself not to watch this after sunset and that I have to watch some comedy anime or something afterwards.
Episode 11pm eh? Can't find it anywhere.

@Krozz I almost pissed my pants from laughter after reading your comment. XD
Well, the curse would NEVER be broken in America or the UK if the spell could be solved by going to a shrine or church. People would be up in arms about their right to freedom from religion.
LMAO TRUE, all i want to say is merry Christmas , don't make me say happy holidays , you would not be having a holiday without Christ so let me say it , GOSH~!
The random loud thunder scared meee! Curse you op headphones :<
yea i had some Beats headphones at top notch and let me say i had the worst shitfit i never knew i could through cuz i'd been watching some other anime and came acroos this then * thunder strike * ended up in the basement like scooby O_O*
Find it funny that people still think beats are quality headphones.
Sorry countermeasure you can't HAVE kouichi- he likes mei and mei likes him ok?
am i the only one who wants kouchi and misaki to kiss?? haha x)
lets go back couple eps to the dancing part first THEN kiss ^_^
I think everyone likes Kouichi x Mei
Yeah, definitely. Mei is a really likable character. Unlike pretty much everyone from School Days. Ugh.
Damn all the cliffhanger Gods! Damn you all too hell.
The more I watch this, the more I have the need to pee my pants ;__;
every episod just keeps geting better i love this anime
I had my volume blasted up. That lightning scared the crap out of me.
phew! every time theres an ad...i might be a LITTLE thankful because i actually remember to breath! >.<
I dunno you guys can have your own opinions but i'm seriously enjoying this show
I never went on trip without a new inhaler on me. Nor did I go if the teacher did not know how to calm me down. An asthma attack causes an panick attack. You cannot breathe, you panick and freak out. Than you die, well at less in this anime
sucks to have asthma,right?
Did anyone else jump when someone knocked on the door? I sure did!
GAHHH~~~~~~ Dx The ending nearly killed me D:
