hey its Vash
cash him in get the $$60,000,000,000 bounty
. . . Poor Vash, He doesn't even do anything and he's wanted for such a high amount as a bounty.
DUDEE!! you mean broom-head? That's hilarious, I never noticed that before XD
it's not vash, it is his vash's brother :3
When suddenly, he pulls a turnip from his kimono!
That baby and the "gozaru!!" LOL
Wow fourth ending already and only the second opening.
Intense pigeon.
"Shak hanz" that kid lmfao - and Kenshin's response was class.. hahahahaha.. Ah this show is just the damn best.
Kinda interested in how Yuri fell in love with Shishio. I still get excited watching this And I've seen it so many times befoooreeee!
The new ending song is just damn amazing, period.
what a terrible opening =_=;
Agreed...it's pretty horrible compared to the previous one.
What.. I thought it was good... =_=;
And 10 seconds longer! I liked the closing though.
She's not singing in tune. Not even for relative pitch.
^ How would you know if she's not singing in tune when it's not your song? She sings it so she obviously knows how to sing her own song.. :/
Wh-why? Why did they replace the opening with such a horrible song?? D:
I think this one is good and with the things that are about to come I think it's better to change the opening even though I love the first one.
This one is better in my opinion especially with the new developments between Kaoru and Kenshin.
Oh my goodness.. no, every single song on Rurouni Kenshin is damn perfect.
Little Iori goes "That it is!" when he see Kenshin. Funny as hell.
Aoiya is really annoying. She ruined this whole atmosphere of seriousness and kinda useless in most situations.

I have the strongest dislike possible without turning into hate for that damn weasel girl. She's so facking annoying and presumptuous.
the granpa really make it bearable with the weasel girl noisiness lol
I hadn't thought of it but I suppose swordsmiths stopped being common in the Meiji period especially after a decade. Now, what... nah, it's obvious that last sword will belong to Kenshin but... is it a sakabatou?? It would be better if not.
