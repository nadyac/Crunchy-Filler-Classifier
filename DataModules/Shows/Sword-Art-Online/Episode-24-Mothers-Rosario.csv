I... cried? I never cry! holy shit that was a good ending.
I cried a lot! I just really want there to be more!
Season 3 Underworld here we come!
I cried like a little girl. SAO forever.

Best swordsman? Kirito didn't draw his second blade or fight seriously against her. If winning the duel against her was important, she would've probably lost by a huge margin.
@kingbw yeah but kirito was about to beat her when time ran out it the tournament during the intro i think that kirito didnt want to win he wanted her to leave something behind like being the greatest swordsman in ALO
Not winning the duel against her was important. Yuuki told Asuna that Kirito knew her secret, so it would seem, Kirito, being the awesome guy that he is, lost out of consideration and respect.
I dunno. It seems like a bit of a false victory. But then, the line between what is true and false is a recurring theme in this anime anyway.
The Feels... Oh FYI keep watching after the outro.
All kinds of foreshadowing at the end of this episode. Come on A1-Pictures, BRING US UNDERWORLD!!!!!!
Is there really gonna be a season 3?!

YAYAYAYAYAYAY!!! SEASON 3 BETTER HAPPEN!
I hope so
Season 2 happened, the ratings don't lie. Also, look on wikipedia to see what happens in the next volume.
A reminder to everyone to continue watching after the ending is done.

It's ok Mangerine. When I met Kawahara Reki, we brought up Mother's Rosario. When he wrote Mother's Rosario, he did not expect it to be as popular as Aincrad and Fairy Dance, since it took a different approach to the world of SAO.

@Wraiem I thank you so much for telling us to keep watching
Manly tears, they're just manly tears. Oh who am I kidding, I'm bawling like a baby!
never cried watching a show before but this is different :'o
Had to call my gal and tell her I loved her. I cried so much this episode
I always see comments about people crying and I never do. But this is the closes I've come to it! Soooo sad!
who knew an anime could cause me to have such a large lump in my throat and make it so hard to breath so beautifully written but so painful to watch
I haven't cried this much since the death of Nagisa and Ushio in Clannad:After Story!!!!

Now I'm crying for real! Such a beautiful quote!
i cried so much during this episode T_T
I finished Sakurasou just before watching this and cried so much I swore I dried my tears completely. Boy, was I ever so wrong...
Suddenly the title Mother Rosario makes so much sense.The eleven hit combo sword skill that 'will protect you.' Its like the Olympic torch that will be passed between generations to come keeping you safe and warm.Yuuki is amazing is all
Um... It's 10 Hail Marys and an Our Father.... so... 11.
Well, in one 'decade' of the rosary that is. There are 5 decades in a rosary, plus the initial Apostles Creed, Our Father, three Hail Marys and Glory Be. Plus there's the additional Glory Be after each decade and 1 Hail Holy Queen.
Seriously! It all came together amazingly in this episode!
If I recall the LN correctly, Yuuki's mother was either Brazilian or of Brazilian descent and raised Roman Catholic. Rosario is both Spanish and Portuguese for Rosary. Unfortunately Baka Tsuki took down their English translations of SAO.
@Santana That could be seen as a good thing since we are getting official English Translations from Yen Press. It only took them 5-6 years.
Someone call a plumber please, there is water leaking in my house and for some reason everything I see seems to be underwater ;~;
Did you check your feels? That's where the leak is probably coming from. I did and that's where it came from. I tried to seal it but I utterly failed.
its almost always just right in the feels
Season 3 Alicization arc please!!

The creator of SAO and Dive Gear
@jaymir559 you know....kayaba...the guy who trapped everyone in SAO @demonhaseo If they put 4 novel of no game no life in 12 episodes, i'm pretty sure they can do this one in 24 episode
Depends how much you want cut out of the series, Linki.
Ringo worked with Akihiko, the crazy guy who made SAO and the full dive devices, and made her own version, the Medicuboid, possibly to try and make up for what Kayaba Akihiko did.

I saw that too! Maybe in the next arc they'll actually get married... My heart can only take so much anticipation..... *DOKI DOKI*

After all, Kirito's virtual virtual camera set-up is going to be studied as a useful addition to the mediboid-thingy. He's gonna be rich.
He's apparently already met her parents. There was shot from outside Asuna's house of her and Kirito sitting down for dinner with Asuna's family.
Like jackets said it was only a second but you could see and think "Wait, isn't that kirito?!"
Yuuki's will forever be known in ALO. The strongest swordsman that fought till the very end. This is how legends are born
I think Kirito let her win. As the expression on his face after the duel shows it.
Confirmed via SAO Wiki - Yuuki used her OSS to defeat Kirito in the 4th ALfheim Online swordsmanship tournament. Look up Mother's Rosario and there's a list of all the times Yuuki used it in the LN.
At this point he also knew she was dying, so of course he let her win. He's a gentleman after all. Besides, he doesn't go all out unless he or his loved ones are truly in danger. He gave her the chance to go out on top. no dual wield or ex
Indeed. He said it himself that he never goes all out unless he seriously needs to and he would prefer not to ever have to fight seriously again. He says it when Asuna asks him if he was actually trying against Yuuki in the duel.
Yeah. Whenever someone's life is on the line, he gets that crazy look and dual-wields. However, the past two arcs seem to imply that he'll never need to do that again.
such feels!. So Kayaba actually gave the plans for the medicuboid? at first i tought self redemption? then what Kirito said about being manipulated and the deus ex machina apparition of Kayaba in ALO's arc, maybe he did escape to the VR?
He did escape into the VR. He just floating round Kirito seeing what he needs, make a riddle, and say have fun with that.


@Maha, this was given to them before SAO started, way before Kayaba disappeared. Which is why she's been in it for longer than they were.

Look at Kirito's Expression at the end of the duel. It obviously shows that he let him win and is happy.
I think every one of us wishes that when we pass on, that we managed to have an impact in this world we know and live in.
In the novels, it was stated that Kayaba COULD log out, but he didn't often.
Heathcliff I guess was a kidnapper but not a murderer. He didn't kill anyone himself besides Kirito and Asuna. Even the laughing coffin members weren't arrested for the people they killed.
The murder weapon was his NervGear's high energy microwaves. He killed them. Laughing Coffin members probably weren't arrested nor tried, because what crime would you charge them with, Player Killing? PK'ing is a game mechanic, in a game.
@DeadlyOats - It's still murder because LC knew beforehand of the consequences. It'd be like taking out the brakes in someone's car. Sure, it's not "murder" directly, but the person doing so is responsible, esp when death results.
@HoshinoKaabi they didn't know for sure what happened when they killed someone in the game, for all they knew killing them could have just logged them out, that and earths laws don't really apply in a situation like that.
'Even if there is no reason its okay for me to be alive because my last moment are of such fulfillment.' Yuuki's speech,the gathering of all fellow fairies out of mutual respect for a great swordsman and the glimpse of her sister.Tearing up
...RIP Yuuki eternal respect
[This comment has been removed]
they said they came out of respect but it probably had something to do with Asuna and Kirito's influence as well. Especially since it only the races that Kirito had interacted with. Nobody that the group hadn't interacted with was there.
I really need to quit watching shows with these emotionally devastating parts at work... co-worker: "Are you crying?" me: "No, I'm not f*&cking crying......"
[This comment has been removed]
I just got a visual on this. *lol* 10/4 over and out hahahahhaha
I thought i could handle the feelings and keep them down. But it didn't work guys, it didn't work :,(

the more important question is WHAT FRICKIN HAPPENED TO KLEIN'S PIZZA IN SEASON 1
Likely, since Klien didn't answer the door to get the pizza, the delivery guy took it back to the store....
Nah, he probably ate it. XD
He threw it on the roof, Walter White style.
The Hospital guys probably ate it when they came to take the Diving Klein to intensive care during the first few hours.
There comes a time when you log out of a game... and never log back in.
