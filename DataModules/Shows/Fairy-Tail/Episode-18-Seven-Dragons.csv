Man, this plan would have had trouble if there were 8 dragons....
If Lucy hadn't closed the portal and have let 10 or 12 dragons then they would of been toast
Pixelilizedmario, So what your saying is, Half Life 3 confirmed!?!? YEAH, i went there, 90% of the internet can suck it

@Heroinbob44 So does Jesus
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? http://www.dial7.com/

Natsu did not hear him. Remember back when he lost the figth in the casle next to future Lucy, so who came to his rescue and who are they working with?? and that person talked to the guys to release Cobra. Get it ;-D
it's cobra already, natsu just did a funny pun. He probably smelled him

Jellal was crazy asking for a favor with the Council.
Ya. But Jellal should be arrested. He's cool and all but he is responsible for the Tower of Heaven. He was arrested but Ultear broke him out!
ill see your seven dragons and raise you a natsu
That made me giggle
You scare me when you giggle
Omg That speech was soo EPIC!
Didn't Natsu say Lucy was transportation in the first few episodes?

maybe because dragons are living thing..just like happy..
@milleray1 Ignore filler arcs
And Lucy isn't??
Things are really heating up! When at the end when Rogue said Natsu miscounted and Natsu said "I can hear him" It gave me chills haha! Cannot wait for next week, Fairy Tail just manages to make you love it more and more each and every week.
honestly the speech seemed so much more powerful and epic in the manga! but still it was pretty bad ass.
Sweep the Leg Mr. Laurence!!! oops sorry thats Cobra Kai.... And there r actually *8 dragon slayers if u count the evil dopplegager Rogue.
but he isn't going to take down his own dragon...... oh wait been there done that

Can I just say that "Dr. Kevorkian of Dragon Slayers" is not a phrase I would ever have thought I would read, and subsequently understand.
Oh man, can't believe Millannas Kitten Blast didnt work...
i saw that and lol'd. What're you thinking XD
"What exactly did you expect to happen??
"What exactly did you expect to happen??".... well for starters.. I expected the dragon to become moe-i-fied and start purring... and maybe a few extra loud yet quiet nyans while blushing... too much?
k i got my popcorn and drinks now lets watch this epi-where did my episode go?
It goes slower if you pause it and rewind it a lot. I do it because I tend to get distracted, but it's ok (:
that was the same thing I was wanting to see. Natsu jumping down,sucking up the dragon and saying his old saying, now I have a fire in my belly. and possibly getting a new move after consuming the dragon such as breathing atlas fire or such
I think natsu hasnt used his second origin yet so that might be something
Why didnt the master or laxus use fairy law?
I feel like it uses an extreme amount of magic power based on the foe. Laxus failed while using it, I can only assume Makarov was stronger than the leader of the Phantom guild. But dragons? I doubt they would have enough power to do that
"I can hear him", oh the shivers.


GRUVIA 4 LYF, lyon can go die in a hole...with spikes...and boiling oil...and...*spaces out, thinking about ways to torture Lyon*

Can Natsu eat the fire dragon? I wonder...
Soon you shall see the friendship of the flames, thats all
that would be the most hilarious moment in anime history.. if he legit just inhaled a dragon. "how did you defeat him?" "oh...i just inhaled"
So Kirby is actually a Dragon Slayer?
I kinda surprised it hasn't happened already to be honest.
yes.. we are all waiting for it... *natsu uses deep breath!* *atlas flame has been defeated!*
next week is gonna be awesome
Zirconis biggest perv of them all
shit gets real
Natsu and Happy need to team up like the old days

mmm Lucy fanservice... yabai!

Pfftt...
Dragon Hunting!
COOOOOBRA!
Guys come on, yes Dragon Slayer Magic works but you know what else works? Shouts! Come on there has to be on Dovahkiin here! FUS RO DAH!
He went full on retarded, never go fully retarded

@ESC074NIDAN i have 2 special needs kids. they were not talking to you so bite it. stop being a hater. it is people like you that make this world a bitc* to live in. take the comment at its worth and not as a insult. if u insulted leave.
I agree with worldseyes retarded is a word that means slow simple as that by you getting offended you yourself with out even knowing it called your kid what you deem so offensive I too have family with need but they are wonderful in my eye
Didn't you already complain about this on another episode? And I coulda sworn that many others including myself told you to stfu about it. I thought the idea here was to NOT go full retard? Stop being such a wet blanket ya doucher!
I wonder if Gray and Juvia will ever become an official couple.
You're all focusing on the wrong couple combination. What about Carla and Happy? Will she ever return his love or is the poor guy destine to pine unrequited forever?
I hope they do. I really like Gray/Juvia. I can't decide if Natsu/Lucy or Loke/Lucy is better though. XD
I think Juvia looks a lot prettier and sexier with the new art style
well they better, because if Gruvia does not exist, neither do i
@rebuild, I can agree 100x with that staement. THANK GOD they got rid of the stupid curling up at the end of her hair, she looks so much better without it.

I'm pretty sure the situation is already quite hopeless and merits last-resort measures, but we wouldn't have plot continuity and epic battles that way.
You need to really hate your enemy, if everyone in fairy tail died then maybe he could use it
They could but then you wouldn't need the chapters in the manga and anime and all the character building that follows. Just enjoy the show
Fairy law is probs like a gun to a person, a target all sort of thing for what you don't like.. now, while a gun may work just fine on a very strong human, even perhaps with armor, shooting a herd of elephants with a bullet each for example
would just piss them all off, and get you brutally impaled by elephant tusks before being trampled till you resemble the reddish dirt found in the grand canyon.

He's a pretty awesome character, glad he's back!
Kick some ass Natsu!!!
ohhhh so many chills in that last 2 minutes!!!!!!!!!
