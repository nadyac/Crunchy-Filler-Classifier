Like if you're also hoping they show all the OVAs of RK here. I just finished re-watching RK OVA Seisouhen.. and well, you guys know what happened next --> T-T
aaand this is as far as I go. I believe the rest is just filler. ^^ Great anime! A classic for sure.
Eh may be filler, but I feel like it is worth watching. Don't forget to watch the OVAs either before, or after, though, everyone! Gotta love the animation. Honestly if you ended up liking the anime, the manga is great to read too. rofl!
To follow up this arc I strongly recommend Samurai X: Trust and betrayal OAVs. Kenshin's tragic backstory and tons of bloody Battousai fighting awaits!
Just thought about this but his clothing was all tattered and frayed, probably time to get new clothing.
How can this anime be so good? T_T
I think Saito is my favorite character, him or manslayer Himura


I highly recommend people read the manga arc that follows this cause it does a really good job of wrapping everything up to such a great series and gives much needed closure to a lot of things.
I think that opening theme actually started to grow on me >.<
Well time to end the manga.
