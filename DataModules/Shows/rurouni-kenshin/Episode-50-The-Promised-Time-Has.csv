I love the music in this anime, it reflects the moods so well
Dammit Kenshin... you're gonna tire yourself in vain before facing Shishio?? And Soujiro comes before on top of it!
I paused on this episode on other sites but now I'm glad I can watch it on CR~! Thank you! ^o^
That new ending song is brilliant.
