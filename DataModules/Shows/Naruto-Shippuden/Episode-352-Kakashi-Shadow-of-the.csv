Yamato reminds me of Sai when we first meet him. Not really understand the human emotion very well. Love these back stories though, keep em coming!

nope
@zirito I don't think you understand how unique these "tree powers" are..... T_T
@kushprasad i think he was jokeing -.-'
We'll have to wait for Sai to draw a tree to awaken his wood power. Wait what?

I'm not even gonna come up with a pun imma just let this 1 air out...............
Didn't anyone ever tell them that smoking is bad for their health?
@Ego You're not going to get a lot of people to back you up with that statement. While I agree completely, there are more anime fans who fantasize about drawings than those who don't. Hell, some are sexually attracted. I find it weird.

Konoha ninja assigned to assassinate one of them=leaf blower?
Mannnnn the Third Hokage could have prevented alotttt of shit if he had killed Oro when he had the chance
ACTUALLY if Orochimaru had become hokage he would have killed danzo immediatly and would have prolly rooted out the ATKATSUKI the moment they popped up....i think he would have been the most dangerous hokage imaginable

@Fried_Twinky - You know the Second Hokage actually invented that jutsu. Orochimaru just tweak the justu.

@Fried_Twinky if u remember the original plan of madara was to use the rinne rebirth jutsu to come to lfe and not the reanimation jutsu so he would have come still
There are some inconsistencies in this filler. In the canon story, Orochimaru saw Kakashi's sharigan for the first time when Kakashi was sealing Sasuke's curse mark during junin exam. Also, Jiraya fought Orochimaru before he escaped.
I hadn't thought of those inconsistencies... I was thinking more along the lines of orochimaru being a legendary sannin and being hurt by a mere explosive note. Also if he already made the curse mark, jugo and thus his outside labs are up
On a side note, I wonder if this is before or after he joins akatsuki? That and maybe he joined akatsuki on orders from danzo to keep tabs on it and itachi?

Not to mention Kakashi spams infinite chidori's like nothing even though he tells Sasuke he could only perform 2 in one day.
Maybe it was Sasuke who had the limitation on Chidoris per day, not Kakashi?
4th ep! Keep em coming~ ANBU Kakashi and ANBU Yamato~~~!
For some reason i like the episodes But the last Manga was Epic ;);)
Just You wait...When We get there EVENTUALLY, (lol) it's gunna kick a lot of ass.
eventually.... u must mean more like at least half an year lol.. -_- the anime is too far behind the manga
i read that after this arc that they would play through the anime for the rest of the year
lol makes sense haha
Dang Yamato...you scary... That eye stare..
The word (Filler) means nothing when you get awesome episodes like these. Its interesting, relevant, and it shows more on the characters backgrounds that manga did not show. THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is how its done
O.K. So the Kakashi chronicles are not part of the manga, which makes them filler. But is the information canon? Also, if it wasn't in the manga, but it's accurate info, does that mean the mangaka helped with these fillers?
It's nice when we get remainders that the characters are human. We've seen Orochimaru battle Kyuubi, so he seems nearly unkillable, but if you get him by surprise with the equivalent of some expensive firework, you get him real good.
He was weak back then, in his current form he would just get out of his ''body'' lose his skin and be regenerated.

He was still a legendary sannin. My point is that we forget that if it weren't for all their jutsus, including the "passive ones," they could be killed by a simple paper bomb or a kunai to the face. But yeah, he'd survive that nowadays.
i Hope We Get A story Line On Guy Sensai
Guy Sensai story line is one word, YOUTH, that is all you need to know
lil tenzo
Yamato's stare tho lol
awesome awesome story, learning stuff we didn't know. I already liked Kakashi but now a more in-depth look to him, and i already liked Yamato, but didn't know much about, well thats about to change! Arg another week of waiting...
Quick! Everybody hide! Cause it's not like we can just turn into smoke or something.
Cliffhangers...
its time
awww yeah
Finally
This is seriously some of the best filler I have ever seen!
