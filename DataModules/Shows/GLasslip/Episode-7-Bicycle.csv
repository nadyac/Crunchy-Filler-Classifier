Seems like everyone hates you David. Well, except Touko and maybe Hiro. Better watch out.
someone spoil school days for me, i only got to episode 3
The writers of School days said that the created the story as a riposte to harem comedies. In most harem comedies, nobody gets hurt and everyone lives happy lives. In real life there is heartbreak and rejection and the awful consequences.
@Shimakuro god thats exactly how i felt watching it! I stopped for a bit before i picked it back up. Was a trial just to finish it.
Oh man, White Album...that guy...
School Days is by far the most creepiest anime i've watched in my life
That was the weirdest bike chase scene I have ever seen.
The little sister of the girl I like rides by me on a bike while wearing a swimsuit and she tells me to stay attractive... yeah, I think I'll listen to her.
Is it wrong that I was hoping for him to fall in love with her instead? It's not that big of an age difference.
During my exchange in Japan I met more parents with a 10-15 years age difference than not. So I guess it is very normal.
Are you sure there was an age difference? Because you may have just been experiencing this effect: http://i.imgur.com/oyn10gr.png
If some girl told me to be attractive whilst jogging, I would probably loose my footing and run into a pole!
I was bracing myself for the impact. It seemed inevitable.
that must of been quite the sidewalk to not have a pole, hydrant, trashcan, etc.
I think they might need to change the name of this show to "Everybody Hates David."


I think we found a titan in the comments somewhere xDD
@chaserrl, reading that comment suddenly made this drama more realistic because for some screwed up reason...it usually all happens that way. One person is immature and it seems to trickle down to the rest of the group.
What do Jonathon & the rest of the coop think of David?
Saachi, I hate to say it, but you totally deserved that.
MelloRain well put, Hiro is the only normal one there. everyone hate David so much that its changing there personality.
Sachi is a manipulative bitch and Yanagi is a mean bitch... don't like how the female characters are being portrayed in this show. I hope Touko stays sweet :/
@yukijoro everyone in this show has glaring faults. But that is what creates the drama right? If everyone in this show was perfect it would be pretty boring.....or a yuri show.
@EnzoCroft Everyone in real life has faults too (there are seemingly perfect humans, but they're usually twisted in some way). Or it would be boring as well.

So did they kiss or not? Am I the only one who wanted to see them kiss?
We'll probably see it in a later episode.
you are not alone!
I think Touka receives visions of true real feelings/thoughts of others, so it possible that vision was David's real feelings of wanting to kiss her!
I think they'll kiss in the future. When she thought of her first kiss she immediately thought of Okikura so I guess she sees the feelings of the people close to her after some action/emotion.
i'm pretty sure they didn't kiss but it was suppose to be a scene of emphasis on emotion. this way touko realizes that david isn't just some robot with no feelings but that he really does value having her around
Yuki should just move on from liking Touko and start his Middle School girl harem. Go get 'em Mr. 5:30 guy.
gives him something to look forward to everyday... but he doesn't strike me as a loli kon character...
Mr. 5:30 x loli swim team. I totally salute and ship that!!!
To be honest, if he looked to his left and saw all the girls in swim suits staring at him, it would probably be really scary XD
If Free is anything to go by, they'll have kickass bodies in another couple years. xD
So its David's fault that Yuki is an jerk? He got turned down and won't accept that his girl likes another guy so he takes it out on David. Everyone believes its David thats ruining everything when its yuki's immaturity that is. Sad...
In Yuki's defence. He seems to have been crushing on Touko for sometime. You don't get over a months of emotions in a day. Plus Yuki was doing ok initially but then David started getting pulled into the group and he lost it a bit.
Overall the deal seems to be that their little group is over and not being friends is probably what Yuki needs to get over Touko. Maybe he'll develop feelings for Yanagi, maybe he won't. But its clear he has to leave the friendship circle.
I feel bad for Hiro and Yuki (even though Yuki is a crybaby). I ship David and Touko. Sachi can get turfed to the Urgent Care ward for all I care. And Yana needs to either leave or start some fan service. (All imo of course)
I don't know if its just me, but the drama scenes feel so anti-climatic. Maybe these are just teasers for the last big one.
well it's not David's fault he is getting pulled into their group, david said it himself he has no business with anyone else but Touko therefore he doesn't want to participate. Touko understands this too and explained but they don't stop
"I think I want to visit Jonathan" We all do Touko, Jonathan has the all the answers afterall :p
I think Touko hears the words and sees the true emotion behind them. It only explains someone of her visions though
I'd second (or 51st, I suppose) that. When it triggered for David I thought, "so he's falling, eh?" *nudgenudge*daddywink*
interesting
that type of special insight can have a wide range of effects. from glimpses of the future to being exceptionally perceptive (i have literally seen the world through other peoples eyes), so it can be very unexpected and unnerving at times.
Good theory. I can't relax at all watching this now, as I feel like there's a disaster looming around the corner. That last vision gave me the hardcore chills.. I've had hardcore visions before also, and they can be daaaamn scary.

Mr. 5:30 guy has a harem and he doesn't even know it.
Like most harme protags. That's one of their inborn ability. To attract without knowing.
like kirito
Kirito knows he has a harem. He just chooses to ignore all the other girls who aren't Asuna.
Kirito's swordplay has been much more aggressive with Sinon though. Can't say I blame him.
He's got the Rentaro special harem atm.
I feel like I'll have to go back and rewatch this show from the beginning once it's over to really understand what the heck is actually happening in each episode. Good show regardless. Don't get me wrong haha.

"Down in Touko town" lmao, that made my night.
I don't know if she is lesbian in her attention. Adolescent friendships can be intense, even crushing. Hasn't anyone felt a sense of loss when a friend started dating?
Hiro's face as he was turning away when he said he was going home, you can just see every ounce of his disappointment in Sachi. It's amazing how much facial expressions alone can say about something.
She said, "boyfriend" oddly, and not "kareshi" boy friend can also mean a boy[space]friend and not a couple.
next time my girlfriends mom says i'm her boyfriend i will say THAT'S MR BOYFRIEND TO YOU

I agree. Of the unrequited lovers my heart goes out to Hiro the most.
Poor Hiro, he's such a sweetie too T~T
If I was him I'd be less stunned at how yandere Sacchi is with Touko, & more concerned with how easily she manipulated him for her own ends!
Prpobably the best episode so far. Things are getting more exciting, but I just want to know what's up with Kakeru and his clones? Maybe he has schizophrenia?
I love how his self thoughts are represented by several of him. Cool
Sometimes you just need an imaginary version of yourself to argue with to find your real feelings on a matter.
I think the real problem is that his alternate selves seem happier than the current David-kun feels.
yanagi also mentioned do you talk to the statue, and he said no, that's because he talks to himself!
Apparently, the other Davids don't like David either!!
"Please stay attractive!" This has been another episode of odd motivational quotes in anime.
It was really more like "please don't become uncool". "Kakkoii" can mean "attractive", but I don't think it works in this context.
Yea, I was wondering if it was a translation that was a little... off.
Handy... that pun. I like it. She gives great massages.
She should learn the way of the Belly Button Forte to round it off.
I never thought of Hiro as a person with standards so when Saachi decided to go do something bitchy I thought Hiro would just accept it but no he's like "fuck this shit im done for today" way to keep standards you got some points now
What the hell is going on?!
Lol Mr. 5:30 guy and Mr. Boyfriend made my day! Oh and btw guys, Stay Attractive!
Hmmm so they were saying he let himself go? lol
she told him in kind words "start lifting weights please"
Yuki chan comb your fucking hair please
