5:30 guy has become 5:30 girl. The swim club does not approve.
Yukinari figured out a way to stay attractive. Just replace himself with a cute girl.
There's at least one girl in that crew that was happy with that change :p
I am going to take my clothes off...artistically! And then walk around nude...ARTISTICALLY! GG Yanagi.
she walks naked past windows, fully legit..
But...why shower right BEFORE running????
The symbolism feels so try hard
@SnowFox Gotta smell good while your getting sweaty
Showering before the run is symbolic of purification
8 episodes later, and I'm still confused as to what is happening.
I don't think it is. I wikipedia'd it and it appears to be only 13 episodes.
i only watch this anime for touko and kakeru :3

You should only watch it for Jonathon.
I know what this show is about. It's about how love tears peoples lives and friendships apart. At least the show is doing a good job at doing just that. This show kinda makes me mad to watch it but still curious to see how it ends. ughh...

I'm not complaining
I haven't been this confused in an anime since I started wondering how Tama in Hayate the Combat Butler could use a keypad but couldn't press a big red button.


I don't always walk around the house naked but when I do, I WALK LIKE A SEXY BOSS!
IKR I love classical piano pieces... I haven't finished the episode yet (I paused it cuz its lagging) But now I'm really looking forward to Darude-Sandsto-- I mean... Pathetique Sonata! :3
@LCS17 GET OUT.. just get out...
When your home alone, I always thought it normal to walk around naked after a shower
@DekerTheChef love that profile pic.
@MysteriousTsubaki-Kun <3

I believe it is 12 or 13 episodes

Have any of her future fragments even come true yet?
Well for example Saachi in the Hospital, Touka was dead on right. The birds / Crows when Yanagi walked away at the beach, I think was more Touka reading Yanagi's emotional state at the time.
Nagi no Asukara was a 25 episodes sooo....
Those baseball kids sure get alot of screen time lol

What is this, Diamond no ace?
I would've loled if you could hear Sawamura yelling in the background.

The seasons around you are changing. Obviously.
or death. Either one...
winter is coming.
@Welsh93 it was black snow, obviously the Fire Nation is attacking.
Um did that remind any1 of swaim from LoL
I hate to brag but I have seen Yanagi naked
Me: 'Yeah! We got to see the kiss!' ... FUCK YOU FRAGMENTS!
I'm glad it wasn't real. She didn't like it, it's no fun if she's not happy about it.
They really wanted us to enjoy seeing Yanagi undress with all those freeze frames...
Also loved the censored uncensored (does that make sense?) nudity. PA Works likes to draw butts.
Dang it... now I've got "Baby Got Back" running through my head... o.O
Dramatic nudity.
So, I bet it means something... Right? right? ... r-right?
She may look good naked now, but keep in mind - with just a slip of the pen she could be hideously disfigured!!!
nice figure, yana-chan.
"I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way."
^Jessica Rabbit!
What is this show even about anymore?
drugs...maybe...who the eff knows anymore
This show is an educational piece on what happens when you have no clue how to write a cohesive story.
All about Jonathon.
^If only...
what was it about in the first place?

Girl, don't walk around the house naked. You'll catch a cold.
Damn those Japanese colds... they're the worst
Whoa, she's going to walk around like that..
My grandparents are visiting today and my grandmother walked in on that seen. she did not notice, I almost explain why there as a naked girl on my monitor.........
"It's okay dear, you're at that age. And, oh my, she reminds me of your mother when she was a teenager."
I thought for a minute that she was going to walk into Yuki's room like that and either confront him or be a major creeper and like...roll around in his sheets while he's away.
^ Implying she didn't... Who knows >.>
Maybe she rolled around in his sheets to absorb his scent to keep the swim-club girls happy!!
The more I watch this the less I understand what is going on...or how the pieces connect....or what the pieces are. The plot is swirling around like molten glass...
Not going to lie but I'm so lost.
Well, it seems like the 5 close friends started drifting apart when David comes. And so far, they're really emphasizing it. And meanwhile, It seems Touko's hallucinations are getting worse. That's about it.
This episode was like a very dramatic way for nothing to happen. Except there were those 2 scary visions...
...and Yana-chan's butt.
It's really just the fault of the characters for being so vague and uncommunicative with each other. They've taken something that could be fixed with all of them sitting down and telling the truth for five minutes and turned it into a show.
That said, I'm still enjoying the anime. Wish the main theme of her visions would progress at about twice the pace, though.
I love this show, but I don't think there's been a single episode where I haven't said, "I'm confused." out loud at some point.
I'm sure they'll explain everything near the end. To me, the confusion is fuel for me to keep watching.
I'm glad I'm not the only one...love the show, but wtf is going on???
i saw someone claim that maybe she see's the fragment and he hears it, and obviously when they're together things get intense. but then again kakeru did chill with like three different kakeru's...and touko is seeing shit on the reg...drugs!
