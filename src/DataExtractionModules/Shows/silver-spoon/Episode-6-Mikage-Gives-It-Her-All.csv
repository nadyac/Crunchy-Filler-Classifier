Let's all take a moment of silence, to honor a great talent that left us.
Good to know i'm not the only one who thought that XD
i really do hate the new character
lol they clean him out
"Mikage Now the time to go all out!!!" HAHAHAHAH that crackede me up so hard
Raise your hand if you cried with Hachiken there at the end. /raises hand
tyro06, he cried because his meeting with his father had left him feeling like coming to that school was one big mistake. But when he saw how his idea made someone so happy, he realized it wasn't worthless.
I almost did. I was glad he found some validation for coming to that school...and for the moment in between those two. =)
Damn right I did, sucker punched me right in the feels this episode did. I love this! I wish I could tell Hiromu Arakawa how grateful I am for her creating it, & thank you Crunchyroll for streaming it!

@lamia85 I agree with you. Seeing that he had helped someone by following his passion validated his decision to attend that school and made his hard work for the festival worth it.

My father never complimented me even when I earned it. He said later that when he was a kid he was arrogant because he was good at everything he tried, and he did not want me to grow up to be like that. I grew up to be a security guard.
got shivers down my spine
dad only came because hes making sure hes ganna get more bacon

The teacher seemed more like a dad than his real gene dono... er, father did. As others already posted, the father seems to be trying to either live vicariously through his sons' accomplishments, or only cares about how they reflect on him.

Now lets get on with the date!
That avatar is perfect with that comment.
They better not brush of that date.
I feel like Mikage likes Hachi now, so i have hopes :3

I'd LOVE to see him facing her father (and his own) and telling them that he wants to marry her and take over the farm. ROFL... They'd both beat the crap out of him then turn on each other.
Ah! I love how this show can make me laugh, cry, and smile like an idiot all in one episode. I love you Silver Spoon!!!
Hachiken's hospital Roommate's reaction to their conversation is the same one I was having.
Can't leave the room, can't stare, can't not stare from behind the manga as poor Hachiken gets the talking to from his dad. that would have been soooooo awkward. -_-'
One of those times you just want to pull the curtain between the beds out and pretend you're not there.
Aw Hachiken....LET ME HUG YOU

Poor sensei's cheese, I was crying with him.
D: Was he crying? I think he just couldn't breathe from shock. xD But at least the principal was with him patting his back. xD
Not even one was left.
I'm sure it was delicious cheese!
Whenever they show Nakajima with his cheese it reminds me a bit of Moyashimon.
Any one else cry when Hachikden cried? Or am I just a big baby
Same here! I feel a lot better now :3
Me too XD
I used to tease people when I was young after I learned to fake cry, now its caught up to me all these years latter, I tear up at everything. Caught me off guard, beautiful moment.
All aboard the feels train.
Definitely teared up with Hachiken.
I just hope after this episode, his character grew some more. I hope they don't over-dramatize him, need to show more resolve and intellectual growth.

That sound effect too! XD
nice guys don't always finish last
Just usually... But he's got other things going for him. He's not the lazy undependable type like many anime protagonists. He works his butt off and not just for himself, he has drive and he's (book) smart. He's finding himself.
Poor Nakajima sensei all his product was gone in an instant.
Yay! I'm not sure why I'm always excited by this show. Perhaps it's because I have chickens?
Farm or yard?
I have chickens, too, but I don't think it's that. Maybe it's because this show is so darn good.
I call it a micro farm. Have some odd 25 chickens. Only a hair over an acre though. Considering goats next.
...I...I'm not crying...*sniffs*
*Pats Darkmagick8 on the shoulder* It's okay, nobody's looking.
Cannot believe what a jerk Hachiken's father is! Good thing he still has Mikage to cheer him up, hope they can finally go out on that date soon!
I have a feeling this will end with a scene like the one from Clannad when Tomoya goes to his dad and says "I'm marrying her."
I have to say, I would be slightly disappointed myself if my oldest son dropped out of college to work manure fields and my youngest ran off because his grades weren't the best. But yes, he could be nicer. Hachiken needs support.
EmD23 - I hope at some point you might wonder what YOU were doing wrong?
If my dad had a face like that, I'd be running no matter what my grades were.
Let's hope this weeks episode doesn't give me as much anxiety as it did last week.

Pretty good episode. I also love that upbeat ending song.
