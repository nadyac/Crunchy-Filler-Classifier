Secret soul reaper hideout for important meetings, a.k.a ichigos room.
it'd be so cool if Kon got a sword too
Yeah! And I wish he had his own body like Nozomi!
I hope the producers of the show are reading this
Don't we all want a body like Nozomi?
hahah Hisagi's book
First he should get a battle body or something
i totally just realized that ikkakku's voice is the same guy who did link from ocarina of time!
I never would have noticed that myself.. That's awesome
i like nozomi's outfit. it looks cute:)
Yup!!..me too!!
wow that episode was so good it felt like it was only 5 minutes long!! I'm so excited for Nozomi!!!
i feel like kon is the second mod sol created

So am I alone in thinking that the coolest part of this episode was the credits?
Like in the sense that I love how they're recapping all the coolest parts through the entire show?

Ermegurd Nozomi's zanpakuto is pretty god damn stronk!
I dont know whats going on, is nozomi a soul reaper or a mod soul???
Go get em little green schoolgirl! Woo-woo
i love how all of them are in ichigos room....aand his room is big enough for 15 people...LOLOL the ending creds!

yes
@Warty157 or your not using mozilla firefox with adblock
basic shinigami training "The Fall" even when your about to pass out you need to say something cool or funny. example "ha ,Now that's pretty awesome." and then you can pass out =3
yet no one wonders on how can a mod soul become a soul reaper...i mean she got a damn sword -___-
Part of a souls reapers soul where used to make her have souls reaper capabilties and above. (idiot)
So wouldn't this also mean its possible then for Kon to obtain soul reaper powers???
What was Hisagi's magazine about? xD
Nozomi beats Zaraki! hehe
Each time i hear Ikkaku voice while he fight it remind me of Link in Zelda lol
