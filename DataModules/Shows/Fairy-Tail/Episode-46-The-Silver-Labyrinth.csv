Happy clearly knows the perfect spot to stay warm.
"...between two pillows!" --Planes, Trains and Automobiles

Same here! XD He ended up eating ices though.
"You can't just jump into people's shirts!" Not unless Erza puts you there first.
hes an ice-dragon now :3
"Get your asses in gear" . You know shit is going down when Lucy makes a serious face.
Worse than Erz....... Never mind.
@AnimeGodRy More or less
Thought for a second we'd gotten EdoLucy back.
Next episode we get to see Gajeel as Batman! xD ^_^
Shouldn't he be Iron Man? lol
Why not both?
he will be batman then eat iron man.
Well since he did eat the shadows before and become the Iron Shadow Dragon he could definitely be both! All fear the IronBat!
finally some love for levi!!
the good old happy, natsu, and lucy adventures

Dirty Natsu..

Its its insanity impossible unrealistic..... wait its natsu never mind XD
Is it just me or did Levy look extra Sexy at the end of this episode?

I was thinking same haha
I was so excited.... all week... for this??? Gahhh! Still an okay filler. I can't wait til we get back to a main plot.
At least the Natsu/Lucy & Juvia episode where in the manga...this one not so much.
To be honest it's nice to have some filler between main story lines. It's a nice resting period which I definitely come to appreciate. If this series was always serious, always in major battles I probably would have stopped watching.
Dude, this is FAIRY TAIL... It's never serious. >_<

Yay, Lucy's hair is back to normal
the three of them as a team are perfect
Aww, I wanted to see Natsu and Lucy make some snow angels at the end there.
me too but alas it didn't happen or the postponed snow fight between Natsu and Happy
9:16 I've seen enough Hentai to know where thats going...
more like 20:20 XD

Ay "get your ass in gear" I would say that to you anime creators Get your ass in gear, I hate seeing this anime become like Naruto Fillers~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I so agree!! XD hahahah You still have to love both shows though
Unfortunately there isn't really enough Manga to keep doing the main plot. First they went on Hiatus and everyone complained, then they tried to slow things down (Eg the Gauru Knights), and we complained yet again. So we got this..
At least there giving us something... I mean its probably really hard to come up with arks have it subbed create new characters and such so as long as they keep up with the fillers (nalu moments) I'm happy XD
the last couple of episodes were from the manga and this and the next few are from a novel special I think.
