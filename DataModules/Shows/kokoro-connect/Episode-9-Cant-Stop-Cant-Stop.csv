Who knew that unleashing hunger could be so entertaining? Most hilarious scene ever!
Iori was so cute <3
Inaba's voice is lovely :>
yes she's celty
She's also Sinon from SAO
One of the school's captain in Saki.
Yeah, she has a lovely voice, but she could bury you underground unfortunately..
Yes, after a few episodes I went and added her to my favorites on MAL. I need more shows with this VA.

i like to read them before the intro as well.. but i learned to not do that, so i read them at the ending now lol
To be fair, it says Heartseed visits Inaba in the description of the episode.

Well the mom doesn't know that and therefore let a scruffy looking male teacher in the room alone with her daughter in the dark xD
I SERIOUSLY want to know what you guys think the comment section is for. Sharing cooking recipes? Talking about politics? Basketball statistics calculations? IT'S A COMMENT SECTION FOR THE CURRENT EPISODE.
lol. "Let's go to a love hotel!" *such* a good idea ><
best idea
Ever wonder if the mom was listening at the door?
they got me good with that one. I had the same reaction the guys did lol
Yes! Inaba uses Google Chrome!
Okay, I admit. I don't like this whole "released desires over the body switching" thing but I greatly enjoyed that snack scene. XD
Awwwnnn that's like, so fweakin cute when he got on his knee's for Yui :3
@eromanrocks How can you hate Inaba? She is the most, or 2nd most, interesting character out of the entire group. Sure she has a slightly dark personality, but deep down she does care about her friends and wants to help them like Taichi.
Who's the 1st most interesting character, cos I think it's Inaba. It's silly that people think that just cos a person doesn't like to talk all the time and considers themselves in a crisis means they don't care about their friends.
Ahhhhhhh! Could my InabaxTaichi fantasy actually be coming true?! Actually it's more like InabaxMe but, you know, close enough I suppose lol This anime is quickly becoming a fave of mine
Thats what I say about almost every anime I watch. ^_^
lol true enough
I want to be Inaba. I'm a little like her. I think it's stupid to always put others before yourself, and I help friends the rough way. I had few friends from 11-13. Plus I like to be alone on my pc sometimes. But, she's cooler than me.
I think Inaba's the first anime character I've ever seen using a smartphone.. Like ever.. lol... I'll go ahead and add that to the list of reasons why I think she's awesome! xD
IKR! They ALWAYS have flip phones with little charms dangling off them. Why?

Best. Hunger. Orgy. Ever.
Man Heartseed is one heartless dude.
Well, he didn't make her phone wet so...
I can relate to the snack scene....right now....as I stuff my face.
Did they just bromance Yui into goin to skool O_o?
20 years old and still watching high school themed anime. wtf, I need to find some college aged stuff, or just more mecha. X3 Can't believe I still like this show.
I'm 30 and almost certainly not the oldest one watching this. Don't worry about it.
HAHAHA ... At least I'm not the only one.
I don't think their is an age limit... plus i agree with most of this stuff. Would have made my life easier had I known most of this as a kid (although I might still be a kid to some really old folks lol).
High school age is probably the most interesting age to be at (middle school is just terribly awkward) so even though I'm 24 and probably till I'm dead, this intensely emotional and dynamic time will forever keep me entertained. Hehe...
I'm in my 50's and I just like a good story. This story is very creative.

if you were listening inaba also called her ka-san which means mom and i'm guessing it can apply to a friends mom as well although that's just an inference from this situation.
People do that in America now too, although usually it's more of a humorous thing.
Inaba her looks her voice actor everything fits her so well the creators producers deserve 60% of their pay
Aoki really must love her
I want a guy like Aoki. :'(
You know it's gonna be trouble when Heartseed shows up at your door. Does anybody else get that sick feeling of dread every time he makes an appearance?
