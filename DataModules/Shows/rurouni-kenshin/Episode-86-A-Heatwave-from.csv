WTF is that horse doing in there???
crazy German horse!

What kind of random legend is that? O.O

It seems like almost anyone Kenshin fights has to at least appear as good as he is.
Kenshin has to test his enemies first by their style, methods and skills. Then the real deal goes down, if he messes up he dies.
