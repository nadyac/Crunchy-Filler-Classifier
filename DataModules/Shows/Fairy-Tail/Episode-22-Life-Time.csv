It is a good question.. because the gate supposedly sucks up all magic near it, so short of dropping a dragon on it I don't think any kind of magic blast will work, but then plot armor.

you want to blow somehing up? Ask erza, gildarts, laxus, natsu, mira, gajeel or...anyone else in the guild, really.
they must be new here...
I don't think the gate sucks up magic anymore. It has already activated and so doesn't need anymore energy. There's been lots of magic used around it for the past few episodes.

If they destroy the time machine, Rogue never came back, so there's no reason to destroy the time machine, so Rogue comes back.
Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey.
Natsu_-_Dragneel XD XD That Doctor Who reference though XD
If they break the portal doesn't she come back since none of this should happen? Or am I missing something on time paradoxes?
She does know that she didn't die worthless. The old lady they encounter later and Grey looks back on is actually Ultear super aged.







There should be a super spoiler option, so that we can differentiate between a spoiler from the episode and a spoiler from the manga.

so true
And Gray touched Juvia's butt twice... :3
One minute was worth a lot.

Since the price of the magic was her time even if the rest of time gets fixed she still ceased to exist.

Ultear's sacrifice was done in the present. The destruction of the portal will only fix what is known up to that point in. They would have to use the eclipse to go back in time to destroy the portal to begin with if the want to save Ul.
I laughed my ass off when she looked at the clock.

and Laxus and Macao and Droy and..and..*breath* She gave some battlers attacks like Sting Gajeel Cobra hehe
Who gives a crap about Droy?
Fuck you, he's still a Member of Fairy Tail, he might not be as great as Natsu, Gray, Laxus, Erza, or as important as Lucy, Markkov, and the Take Over Sibblings but he's still a Fairy Tail! And Every Fairy Tail is Important!
Except Droy.
The sadness of it really hit me when I thought back to when her mother sealed away Deliora by giving up her life to cast Iced Shell. Ur and Ultear shared a fate that ultimately protected not just Gray and Lyon but everyone. She got redeemed
Yeah that sucks! I was thinking the same thing.
Oh someone give Ultear a hug ;_;

Tears shall flood through this episode.
she isnt old lol, just looks that way now
more like she was charred.
Anime logic: 1 minute in anime time = 24 minutes. This is law of the universe.
Well, the episode is covering different people at the SAME time, so it still makes sense, doesn't it? Regardless, amazing episode.. Ultears character development was well done and her sacrifice, to that OST, sucker punched me.

rly? I thought 1 minute was like 3 weeks according to hunterxhunter xD
Who says all scenes in those 24 minutes are all in order or occurrence? Some may be concurrent.
Did anyone else notice that Ultear's short flashback lasted over 20 minutes in Fairy Tail time? You can see by looking at the clock.
Anyone got a minute?
Nope to busy nearly fighting off dragons =3
EVERYBODY has a minute, now!
No Ultear... You have changed.. Your final actions have proved it
So... if future Lucy knew to destroy the Eclipse gate (as per her journal), then why didn't she tell the rest of the team that immediately? You know, instead of crying and calling herself useless before dying.
I knew it was coming, but is still sad to see it happened. Ultear!

Technically he never died.

After starting to watch Fairy Tail more than two months ago, I have finally caught up with the series with this episode! It's been fun to binge at my leisure but I'm glad to be watching with everyone else now :D Ultear made a difference

Them tears wont stop
