that has to be the 5th time seeing him crushed by that damn boulder. holy shit how many recaps can they possibly do in this series!!
but he didn't have it yet I don't believe @exiledraven
He had it but he was to low on chakra to use it

but did you realize they said something different in this flashback than they did in the previous one and episode
It looks like the show ships Obito and the boulder, even though their compatibility is quite CRUSHING!

What kind of messed up translations did you read Hyakudou? Obito spoke about helping him in the restroom in the translations I read too.
sounds like u were readin a hentai no a manga lol

it might have been a yaoi fan girl doujinshi
Yeah, uh, Hyakudou, I think either you misread or the person who translated it was a troll. XD

that how making money
@adamrichardson, you're way off, I dont know who said it (it might have been kakashi) they said that since naruto controlled the 9 tails his own chakra was weaker so to control the 9 tails he would have to be pretty strong.
all the people who had red hair in this anime r practically uzumaki with the exception of naruto
I've been reading since 2000 back when it was on Toriyama's World only and years before the anime started in Japan, then those first couple of years when there were specials and no movies. Seems soo long ago. I was Flashback Obito's age...
protagonist powers
A flashback within a flashback
flash-ception! ehh ehh!.. noo? no... okay i see the door >.>
requires 3 flashes
Is this like a dream within a dream? ....we most go deeper
Flashception
Any more and we'll all be stuck in limbo
Waited along time for this episode. I mean the episode was great, we got to see Obito's past. But there wasn't as much action packed fighting as I'd hoped for
If he does get "brainwashed" tsukiko_siti... Maybe he gets motivated to hate mankind of his own will. Well...maybe you read the manga, IDN. Im usually bothered by flashbakcs too, but this ep was deliciously devious. I like it !

i think they want to make it clear that he got crushed by the rock lol
@connie94: We have to be sure. You know?
You guys have it all wrong. Obito is stuck in Madara's Izanami getting crushed by a boulder over and over. The only escape is destroying the world. Obito isn't a bad guy. Being crushed by a boulder over and over. You don't have much choice.
Pretty sad!!! Obito was not evil; more pure than kakashi...It's that damned Madara always munipulative
obito is like sasuke??? just for his sharingan... i think obito is a bit more like naruto, they got the same attitude
I think Orochimaru is more evil. Madara'a plan is more devastating. But in the end, he wants to put the entire ninja world in a illusion to end fighting and have peace. Whereas, Orochimaru wants to live forever and learn every jutsu...
...his goal seems more selfish. And he uses and discards people as tools all the time. But Madara is more powerful and has killed way more people.
obito is like a pre-naruto, same goals, same personality, in love with a girl who liked his incredible, high achieving team mate- they really rubbed that fact! now we just have to wait and see what happens next to make him join team madara.
Yeah Obito is basically an Uchiha Naruto who ran into Madara instead of Jiraiya. All that potential wound up being used for evil instead of to save the world.
the ending credits
I approve!
Really says something when the ending credits are more interesting than 3/4 of the episode..
The ending credits recapped the episode (and all of them other flashbacks). What are you guys talking about?
Your profile picture fits these episodes perfectly
Woot! New ending!!!
Yes the best one I heard in a while, now what numbered ending is this?
28

New ending was very emotional...
Agreed. It was pretty good.
if only he returned home........:/
There would be no allied shinobi then... The best way to unite everybody is to provide them with a common enemy.
wish they released a double episode to start of the return of the show for the new year D:
well they are going to now haha
Seeing Konan made me sad though.
The anime will make Obito look better than the manga did.Jjust wait.
I see that coming as well. Manga fans: Obito is a little whiney pussy. Anime fans: Aww poor Obito. I feel for him. Lol
Not all manga fans felt that way about Obito. I certainly didn't. Most of the people who felt that way were those that were still bitter that Izuna or some other loser wasn't Tobi.
Wasn't half of this shown just last episode? Do they seriously think their audience is a bunch of amnesiacs?
They must think that everyone who keeps up with the show is stupid. We can't remember anything that happened more than 1 day ago even though many of us have been watching naruto for over 10 years.
well you are stupid

Oh yeah, next episodes about to be great. Also, good ending.
"So what do you want me to do? Help you with bathroom stuff?" Oh Obito.
I was soooo hooping for a double episode after the break... Instead we got a half episode and half replay of earlier episodes... But at least we got to see how you make tossing a weapon to your side-man look awesome!

that ending was one of the best ive seen really emotional
Agreed, the ED pretty much goes through most of the main turning points and events of his life and that was what really stood out to me animation-wise. Song was really fitting too!
