Welcome back Kuroko!
I have been waiting ages for this show to come back... T.T
Man! Now I know 2 Sport animes that are actually going up every week! So Glad =D
Finally start watching it again...after reading the manga with the end of the game
Yass
who knew Akashi could play the violin?! man him and Kuroko are so freakin HOT KAWAII SUGOI
One does not simply take Kurokos Basket off the most viewed anime.
!!!! BABY KUROKO!!!!! BABY FREAKING KUROKO!!!! My Kawaii Feelz. Ending Theme OP
I am worried if his parents, babysitter or anyone had trouble finding him bcz he is kuroko. Definitely don't want to lose him if I am watching over him
SO CUTE!! *squees*
Glad to see Kuroko restored to its rightful place on Crunchyroll
If they showed all of the highlights you can add your own commentary of, where do you think your going and get that shit out of here.
2 weeks late!but still,better late than never!woooo!
I wasn't expecting this when I opened CR, it's been a while
neither was i when i saw it i fan girled all over the place in excitement never done that before was a new experience lol
Indeed. This was quite the pleasant surprise
And I thought Hanamiya was bad. Haizaki takes it to a whole new level.
Hazaki is the type of guy you want to beat up
* cries tears of joys * MY BABIES ARE BACK
"Eagle eye, Uruguay. Eagle Eye, Uruguay. Eagle Eye, Uruguay" Laughed so hard at this xD
Omg. So glad KNB is back. Great first episode. Got my heart racing.
Heeellllll yeah. Now, if only I could insert myself into that anime and kick the living shit out of that guy for sucker punching one person and choking another...
I too feel that my biggest struggle with anime is not being able to get in there and punch somebody while the main characters are just yelling, man I love this show!!!!
Alex should have tried kicking that trash a lot 'lower'...
Haizaki...the guy you want to punch. With a brick. That's on fire.
Was just browsing Crunchyroll clicked Kuroko and just see episode 51 here waiting for me, had no idea it was out today!!! Highlight of my week waited so long!!!
I completely forgot that the episode was out today, so it was a nice surprise for me, too! XD
Scum will always be scum.
KISE <3 my lover... i mean *cough* my Favorite Character!

I hope they catch up to the releases soon. You really can't call it a simulcast if its 2 weeks behind.
AoKaga right in the first ep, damn what a way to start!
One does not simply choke Alex and expect not to get attacked by waves of otaku comments.
