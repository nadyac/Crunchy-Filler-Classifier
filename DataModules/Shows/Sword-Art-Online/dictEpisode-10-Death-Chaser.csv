willyouprotectmeforever get line sinon this comment removed thats right camera cave all ggo players were watching were probably like english proper noun english proper noun english incorrect not being funny internet people can spell bloody well please all can picture asuna hair flying everywhere flames behind her shes kiiiiriiiiitooooo angrily calm smiling face while saying kiritokun would calm demeanor"kirito kunwe need talksharpens knife god epicuriandreams thats murder already xd kiirrrriiiittoooo kiritokun either way hes doooommmed except knows already picked her yeah think asuna pretty confident secure connection least enough wouldnt freak out lol though previously mentioned scenarios still freakin hilarious sinon realised after 10 minutes hitting kirito killed him by witling down his health did by hurting her hand loled real though scenario ive always wondered what official difference between hard slap sao something like time kirito killed his attacker by using his bare hand do sword art ability game could obviously tell difference oh thatld second time kirito got hand imprinted his vr face lol ln explains picks up an unarmed combat skill set somewhere along way same quest reason his informant cat whiskers drawn her face makes sense context hit by gunner yea but ep10 like significantly through books supposed 24ep what going do after hum am guessing rate 26ep most ep rosario never said spent whole week just checking stadium joke about waited one week between episodes did those things offscreen endingbeginning episodes all know werent literal week ended sao im just waiting sinon realize shes love kirito then find out about asuna yui will ugly im not really into kirito hero feels like anime all about many females can wrangle leave out dry sinon way cooler than kirito before last few episodes queen ment would feel wrath mother daughter having an affair behind familys back xd think problem comes kirito not saying already girlfriend up until asuna sao merely made friends but every female friend makes falls love him but dont think its mutual lol im just sitting here wondering can see all ingame video feed oh no its part asuna yui finds out about sinon thats really ugly huehuehue klein during damnyoukiritowhydoeseverythinggoodhappentoyou oh noticed first series every female character helped falling him hah doesnt bother kirito himself isnt treating like harem true kirito pretty awesome who klein really hate every time male protagonist finds bunch female friends its automatically harem all know hes committed asuna doesnt return feelings saosurvivor your bit more then kirito more like saoliberator only few people know released seed only asuna knows about heathcliff id pretty much open pandoras box because wanted play vrmmos lol why company sketchy because wont divulge private information about its users random government just so happened want could just destructive death gun himself no kirito isnt saosuvivor vrmmogod not sure id would even work ggo yeah comes seed but alo specifically stated borrowed heavily sao then implication heathcliff still alive net some extent not entirely mess up childs life 101 bully her treat her like monster 100% guaranteed effectiveness your money back side effect may include child turning into worlddestroying villain andor become suicidal humans absolutely 100% animals our scientific biological classification not plants not microorganisms animals our intelligence reasoning do not change lol 666 likes what just said contradicts say irreligious people more barbaric though also say isis revels fail see contradiction think christianity only religion feel sorry even combine all religions together nuts since all unique worldviews doesnt equal number people who killed name secular statism 20th century isis just playing catch up nothing says evil like riding robot horse pale horse apocalypse its rider death hue hue muh biblical allegories all missing his western bad guy hat an evil laugh gains ground would more awesome set fire so horse were being chased down by then play song similar ghost riders sky thats what thinking too actually im pretty sure whole bit an homage onapalehorse by piers anthony many times am going hear see raid party footage seriously youd think event would pretty big one shown last season considering bent up kirito about humeray flashbacks maritos version nam flashbacks im glad a1 pictures actually animated raid read light novels kirito did mentioned but wasnt shown light novels did so far whole better not fuck up like 8bit did is2 actually while did make up fit story did introduce neatly enough posting his first kill basically ptsd make bit bigger deal out ln explained bit better might still future eps but unknown now recommend guys check out book after season though next arc also great dat lap pillow imagine being broadcasted asuna watching lol actually its being watched live scan doesnt work because thats people game what kind big tournament doesnt coverage anywhere map what battled into cave sorrynosignalinthegamewecreatedbecauseofcave think crows what used broadcast didnt see any around cave clarification; asunas not watching watching match last episode alo but then signed off because youll find out later but all all asunas not watching whats going cave kirito sinon so game watching progress another game can take break shooting people ggo sit down watch some pixies dragons take down flying fairies love kirito totally downplays actually best player actually one who freed everyone dont actually even know kirito really best one best perhaps what everybody knew solo player took more skill guts do so heathcliff straight up tells him hes best its why given dualweild tells him youwerealwaysmeanttofacemeintheend mind three people sao sao liberators; frontline soldiers who worked clear dungeons sao survivors who were merchants etc sao escaped convicts who were murderers trying ruin game thats not way thinks his mind just doing what needed do nothing special yes but all other girls watching focuses fights so all saw him princess carry girl safety dont think asuna wont hear about hey read light novels too scowly dont spoil nonreaders spoiler disguised theworldgodonlyknows references right yeah scowly some us want see play out spoile yourself but dont ruin rest us baka oh kirito somehow always know manipulate peoples psychology mr illshootitwithyou justthetip its never just tip profile picand then usernamexd well played colon013 ihateyoubutletmeleanagainstyou youre so romantic sinon weird sense romance one its called tsundere buddy thats not what your avatar saying xd yeah chick logic just try not understand go flow writers logic actually its good thing tournament probably shows people fighting cause girls saw sinon lean agains kirito would some explaining do now wait week see action like girls sao soufen but majority bond girls die likes which why always gets new one liz silica sachi asuna dear a1 pictures anime episodes supposed roughly 24 minutes please stop making minute episodes nauh dont care clock said 1000am pst episode finished definitely wasnt 24 minutes just doesnt feel like 2425 minutes watching episode then all sudden over 15 minutes but actually 24 mins must time perceptionmanipulating dude employed just fuck us show itself only 20 minutes count fact opening theme ending theme both minutes change piece so yea still only seemed like minute show were talking cave like 15 minutes episode ended way too fast true no episode just went way too slowly all episodes end fast why cant episodes hour long like walking dead under dome other american shows im calling death gun dies final fight death gun will some where along line drop his pistol kirito sinon will pick up shoot him his own gun actually more think about will sinon will do then excitement shinon accidentally kills kirito series ends all remaining arcs nullified good prediction unless death gun someone know real world then would seriously fed up love these comments prediction similar but add an enemy accomplice who stays real world does all actual real life killings not sure who would get most poetic justice rights defeat end though asuna maybe ooooor will get gun choose not kill him lmao already live inside what smooth operator kiritokun your player skills truly unprecedented sure use next time waiting moment ask her let him live inside her then get what every male anime does caves alone main female character but started punching him instead mood lost support sinon long harem ending enabled comes asunasinonleafalizsilica id rather asuna everyone else intabus dont normally humor nature comment but see where going would cave within cave caveception yoo google someone start make games like people this comment removed
