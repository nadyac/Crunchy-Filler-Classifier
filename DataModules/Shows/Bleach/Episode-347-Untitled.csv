recap over at 2:10
Why is Orihime starting to look like Rangiku?
there big boob solidarity sisters
What if Rangiku is actually one of Orihime's ancestors? o.o

@HonestWing ...Please tell me that you don't normally type like that? Like, is your spelling and what not really that bad or is it that you're just being lazy?

being cool is a fulltime job, man
Dave Strider agrees.
@BakemonoTab omfg, I love you!!!
Or stalk people they like.
The dude that plays his psp all the time reminds of Keima from "World God Only Knows".

It sounds like Chad is trying to get Ichigo to come out of the closet.
LMFAO!! I was thinking the exact same thing haha
I like how the translation is super literal with the "Brother Ichi". It makes him sound like he's a monk or something.
I Think I Miss The Soul Society As Much As Ichigo Does :{
I like this yuzu Shes a fiery little loli lol

I too liked Kon. He was funny.
i just liked how cute he was honestly haha
I could have Kon in my room talking shit to me all day. Ahhh miss that little fella
Kon probably went to Soul Society with Rukia. That or he's hanging around Urahara's shop.
I didn't care for Kon much in the first 300 or so episodes, but he really redeemed himself in the last arc.
Ichigo is looking mighty fine these days. <3 Side note: reaaallly starting to like this arc! Love Bleach! :>
The one guy tha just plays his psp reminds me of wonderweiss, just one that can actually talk. I don't understand why want to be free of their powers, its not like its made them grotesque or something
LOL! @17:39, Yuzu is upside-down but her skirt uses its magical powers to stay rigid. Said the skirt: "Fuck you gravity! There's no way I'm letting anyone else see my Yuzu's panties!" *pedobear am disappoint in the background*
I like the red headed pony tail girl ..................................pony tails are nice !!!!!
omg! Ichigo saw the hollow in his mind!! yay!
i love the subliminal sony psp add Awesome
LOL at Ginjo's story at the end!
Bleach is back on top in my book. It's better than ever honestly.
Funny at the end where Ginjo explains how he had to get Ichigo's substitute shinigami badge back. xD I guess throwing his badge away in the anime wasn't that bad lol...
Good citizen Ichigo, still waits for the pedestrian light to change before running after the bad guy.
