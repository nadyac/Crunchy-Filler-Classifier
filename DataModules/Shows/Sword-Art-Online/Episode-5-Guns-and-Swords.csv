Don't worry Kirito, I'm sure one day you'll remember that you can't sheathe your photon sword on your back. Probably.
They must be using the exact same sound effects as star wars did for lightsabers.
I thought he would cut off his hair when he stuck it behind himself
The force is strong with this one Hmmm
I would feel really bad if Kirito suddenly impaled himself with his own sword -_-
loooool

Well he did bow right away and appologized.
Sinon was careless, she doesn't know the 2G rule, there are only two kinds of people on the internet, Guys and Guys In Real Life.
How many times has he gotten that red slap of indignation on his face? Two? Three times,now? LOL
sometimes it feels like he should explain about himself
@JakeySyan And it's all thanks to science!!!


Oh you already have one severe case of PTSD? LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE!
Laughing Coffin is back and serious shit will be going DOWN!!!
Kirito, don't be rude. Answer the nice man's question.

First the Photon Sword sound effects, now Death Gun has Darth Vader breathing. Maybe Death Gun is the father of Kirito?
Sinon knew ahead of time, she was just faking it.

Star Wars references, Star Wars references everywhere...
I'm sure Sinon's friend is multi-boxing. Two identities at the same time! :O Maybe?! D:
Hahahaha!! But yeah, i keep getting the feeling that its sinon's friend too! even in the opening, it kinda hints at that when they change from his image to Death Gun's image...
What is it with Kirito and seeing girls in their underwear?
So a slap on the cheek gives you as much damage as being stun 'naded

Not again.....
Psh, oh please. Kirto has nothing on Urashima Keitaro when it comes to accidentally seeing girls in their underwear (and suffering the consequences for it).
kirito is just being respectful. although he already is getting sauna's pussy. He wouldn't cheat on her
Pro tip # no.2: 'Never show off your main weapon thirty minutes before a fight' cos 'its just asking to get countered.' Remember these words of Sinon to abide by guys!
@shippage you can counter with tactics as well not just weapon choice. if someone has a shotgun you stay far away, if someone has a sniper you get as close as possible.
I wouldn't get close to a sniper in close range. Some people can quick scope.
What was really moronic was all those players shooting their weapons in the air wasting bullets before the tournament began.
It's a traditional practice done around the world okay!
well at least in real world the bullets will drop to the ground randomly, so its a irresponsible tradition
Wow shit got real...no spoilers but this is where the novel started getting REALLY GOOD!
The license for the novels has been purchased and begun release in English.

ugh.... another week long wait.

Haha nice one dude.
Good thing i wasn't as work. Everyone in the breakroom would want to know what was so damn funny.
/@higaruZanzou i wouldn't say that he's a troll. He just enjoys friendly banter/trash talk which imo isn't a troll though some may disagree.
He didn't ask to see her bare, it just happened
Yeah... considering Kirito's trying to get Sinon to help him, reminding her that he saw her in her underwear doesn't sound like the best idea...
Once again, Kazuto's MO for picking up chicks. Bump into them, piss them off, seduce them while they're not looking. 4 for 5. lol.
sadly hate and love are both strong emotions and once someone excepts a person's bad points and accepts them they begin to to see the good if they don't actively dislike the person and love comes from accepting someone completely
totally waiting for someone to comment "Who's Kazuto?" Ah screennames, how they become roe real than real names.
Anyone willing to confirm?

or if they are like me who watched SAO from the beginning an forgot who some characters where lol

As soon as I watched all of the first SAO, I was thinking to myself, "They did this huge buildup for Laughing Coffin and nothing freaking happened!" So I read ahead and wasn't disappointed.

@SheldorTeConquer ggo is run by an american company and refuses requests for player information due to the fact of real money trading system in game.
But they can find out who the player is based on the SAO Laughing Coffin players still in lock up. I think we can figure it out from the flashbacks though.
Japanese government declared everything happened in SAO stays in SAO. So none of the Laughing Coffin members are locked up irl.
Sinon welcome to kirito's Harem.
Veretax he referenced the previous episode not because it was a recap but because it showed that she does in fact have some serious issues.
Unwitting harem, probably, seeing as he's fixed on Asuna.
most harems are that way, basically. trust me, I have one >.> TOO many girls like me, follow me, ext. but there's only one that I like that way. xD
Ey the more the merrier!
@VoltocityGEL... You sure those girls aren't just humouring you??? Things fly over your head a lot? ... birds, planes, supermen; that sort of thing??
The sound effects for his photon sword sounds exactly like the Star Wars effects. I guess they used the same sound library. Great to finally see the bullet deflection in action. If anime has taught me anything it's that swords beat guns.

And that Disney is about to sue their a** off now that they own the rights to Star Wars -_-
@bulletprooff1k best of both worlds!
@DaPoetDC No, he said himself that his character was converted, meaning his stats go here. He tells Sinon this.
Asuna asked him in the previous episode if he was sure he wanted to convert his character since that would reset his item inventory. He said he couldn't take the time to rebuild skills so it was necessary.
'Don't Follow Me' Sinon Fanservice!!! HELLS YEAH!!!
haha best part!
The Force is strong in this one!
@ flamingMangos I believe they said the shields were only effective for long to medium range so at point blank it would work the same.
They said the shield reduces the damage. If you had a energy beam in your chest I imagine you would take continuous damage. You wouldn't know it without the shield. That was clearly a deathblow without one.
It would be great if in the anime if they have him deflect beam weapons attacks back with the photon sword too! If they did I'd been squealing like a school girl at Bieber concert.
Dodge bullets? When he's ready, he won't have to. Go Kirito Reaves!
@Moviewatcherfl That's how its gonna go down if season 1 finally is any sign. But first, i bet IRL he'll pass out, trapping his subconcious in the game world, then... wait, that sounds like what happened to that One guy...
Anime rules for conquering a girl:Have a girl-like avatar and play along with it whilst the girl(Sinon) thinks ur female,bond with her, then reveal urself when she is stripping and get slapped.Finally stalk her and leave with badass comment
LMAO
That's exactly the way to do things; Kirito, stay classy!
Rule 34 guys
This might sound weird but I've always envied the beautiful landscape and high tech/futuristic environments in RPG games or in this case MMORPG. =/ If only we can have something similar to SAO, life be so great!
Technology is advancing pretty fast, I'd give them about 10 to 20 years to create this kind of stuff.
maybe around the time 2022
I heard that US and UK has VR military research. I hope if they do invent this they won't take as long as internet to make it available for public =(
Ok just searched online, Sony Project Morpheus looked alot better than Oculus now all we need is for Sony to add a product that allows you to move your limps without gong anywhere lol.
technology increases exponentially. as time goes on and we create more technology, that technology allows us to create more. with this reasoning, we can conclude that a "full-dive" game system will be created within our lifetime.

they likely read the light novel
yeah the light novel says
Yeah comments about predicting don't mean anything if the full story is out.
I never read the story, but the first thing I thought of when seeing the guys mask, hood/cloak was of the laughing coffin guys from episode 6.



Well, to be killing players in SAO, knowing that they would most likely die IRL as a result, wouldn't they sorta have to be twisted in the first place?
Sociopathy does come to mind with the Laughing Coffins
Kirito's next big weapon surprise.... THE GUNBLADE
Sword Art Online: A New Hope Sword Art Online II: The Laughing Coffins Strike Back
Good play Sir,.... Very good play.
Lol more like Sword Art Online IV: A New Hope and Sword Art Online V: The Laughing Coffins Strike Back. Then Accel World could be considered episodes 1-3 lol Episode I the Fatman Menace lol
fucking jedi over here
that right kirito a bad ass can we see some duel sword action.

lol Im 99% positive that they used most of the sounds samples actually used in the movies
I'm absolutely certain the sword-sheathe sound is the same. I heard it all the time playing Jedi Outcast.
Did anyone else catch the fact that they are playing in a Hollow Deck? I am a Star Wars/Star Trek die hard and no one has even mentioned it. Check out the visual from when he enters and then when he becomes hyper aware....
