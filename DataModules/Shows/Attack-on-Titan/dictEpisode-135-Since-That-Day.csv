bright side being counted 135 then least its not being wasted one 24 eps so youre still getting 24 eps recap who needs recap binge watched 13 episodes like day this comment removed theory believe father someone who opposes law leave walls armins parents cuz first subtle line parents who went outside walls which never hear again special titans im just remembering fact mikasa nice long hair before cut off cuz eren said should aot cosplayers actually outnumbered super mario one piece naruto weekend anime expo la good thing wutevz looking fwd ep 14 weird know recap episode but showing us eren dreaming about events come mean anything made wonder why lying grass under tree were supposed working why crying seen show do before wasnt even good begin yet still made mad instantly destroy whole story built an amateur author pisses off best not do anime eren having very strange almost foresightful dream first day mikasa found him started crying dont think all dream but do wonder eren some foresight just tunes into titans sometimes could all just realize perhaps staff just made recap video nothing do arc any manner but highlight some awesomeness think reading way far into believe eren crying because his memories injection guys speech wonder why armin always narrating maybe will mean something end why say something so confidently no idea what youre talking about do show reruns japanese tv all time dont see because fansubbing groups arent going resub release repeats old shows lol never noticed voice armins record japan record actually drake does an idea what hes talking about because dont show reruns anime japanese tv may show same episode more than once one day but dont rerun whole season wont load why holy shit dreaming about future 1st episode swear steins;gate timeloop aspect would cry frustration joy same time think while jail cell just flashback dream about waking up 1st ep mikasa standing over him least thats what want believe oh yay timey wimey wibbly wobbly stuff really hope isnt case nice one doctor who reference but its wibbly wobbly timey wimeystuff xd soundtracks make anime so much better although its probably not case id like think added kickass music recap after reading comments crunchy roll regarding much everyone liked song last episode doubt crunchyroll anything do most time these episodes planned way advance any case definitely getting stars doing such great job youve payed attention last few eps youll realize just important episode staff ive caught few scenes missed cell coloring etc series high quality isnt done overnight thank good lord series getting an absurd amount effort thrown spring series people gotta understand stuff takes time finagling production ig panel anime expo la yesterday someone asked president errors were due time budget limitations elaborate his one word response ryouhou both way kill troll shachousan isnt take pressure off anime staff its stop anime catching up manga like naruto got year filler why so many adapted anime terrible pacing especially go like dbz one piece id say multiple purposes rather than just one havent read manga aot yet but understanding other peoples comments here only comes out monthly one recap episode middle series isnt going slow down much since day eren sleeping well least no new footage etc can hear best songs ost those were thoughts exactly love soundtrack series can least appreciate being treated some good tracks watching right after listening gundam unicorn ost hiroyuki sawano evil genius good music helps all ways full soundtrack say its just one those badass soundtracks listen repeatedly lol believe same people who did guilty crown soundtrack im not mistaken but its not quite epic recap episode also japanese audiences do not luxury watching anime services like crunchyroll must watch anime network tv some may missed beginning story good point were actually privileged able rewatch since japanese audience cant can stream anime niconico japan isnt only limited time though remember watching black rock shooter niconico older episodes got removed once new ones aired dont know changed since though recap episode people who dont pay attention during first minutes every episode still good episode nice one guess youre japan only get opportunity view first run episodes cant record episode heaven sent were lucky can just rewatch all our leisure still cool reflect past eps people japan can download episodes off internet just like can more get new viewers into people already into perfectly capable going torrent site downloading series recap way nothing else gives us one more chance enjoy amazing opening before new ones starts playing episode 14 lol preview mikasa scary~~~ dont understand why being treated criminal though one just plugged hole yes but didnt already cover last few episodes now seems like just going back forth between trusting him not trusting him trusting him not trusting him tdbgamer besides point about him losing control once which point only few people charge even know human race reacts everything fear takes control people do stupid stuff hes survey corps special yaoi dungeon do not want know what happens perhaps do guys did see note last episode said titans showed up 107 years ago right dont think its keep changing trusting him not trusting him more like an enormous number peoplesome willing take chance others terrified him all complaining about one recap episode sound stupid like just finished an entire arc 10 part battle most anime go whole filler arc after completing an arc quit complaining about one recap short staff even said thought wasnt going big but did were pretty amazed want give show everything got recap able work new ep much longer could make dbz comparison most episodes were people standing around doing jack all like dbz but damn lot filler like thatlets talk about whole episode then five goku powering up considering story jumped lot first 13 eps episode wasnt too bad plus some good music fresh perspective what happened doesnt hurt bid farewell most epic energizing opening industry seen while can only hope new op well get rivals first one awesomeness goodbye great ending too which sadly overshadowed by op considering rewatched every episode like 10 times already wasnt fun same here sigh fun actually prevented rewatching series third time lets see long can continue without rewatching xd lol ohh well funny comments xd so what its like without internal monologues flashbacks actually all fits 20 min think did an amazing job making story flow recap like doesnt show uploaded guess well usually comes every saturday guess didnt make big deal since its just an inbetween recap episode instead whole new one every saturday 700pm est translate what ever time zone remember episodes might also delays like one crunchyroll rss feed so maybe could subscribe
