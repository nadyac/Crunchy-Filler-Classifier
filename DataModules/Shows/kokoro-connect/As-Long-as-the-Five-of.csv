I love this show, there hasnt been a single weak episode. All of them have been great.

you can just go on " gogoanime.com " to watch the rest
such an amazing anime :') i admit i nearly cried at parts of the anime..
ahh full circle anime really get the feels flowin
i dont cry to onions movies or anything. The only anime that ever made me shed a single tear was nana and clannad.
Fuuka had me cryin'. That's the only one. Monogatari almost had me in tears, but it didn't get to that point. Instead it felt like I got punched in the chest.
@callidus91, clearly you havent watched anohana
Anohana will take your feelings, wad them up and play tennis with them.
@Chris39ford and @mickey3074 were did you watch the last four episodes? I cant find them.
www.animesub.tv don't blame me for quality issues or if you pick up a bug there
I'm desperate for Taichi to get Inaban, and CR probably won't ever get the last 4 episodes because they're OVAs. There isn't a single series on CR that I've seen them provide the OVAs - ever. They need to sort out lacking 1st series' too!
episodes 14-17 made the perfect conclusion to this series. You absolutely HAVE to watch them! The ending and the way they wrap this series up is beautiful ^_^
Thanks for the link, chris49ford! Just watched them all and man I want more -_-
I wish crunchyroll would upload the next 4 episodes (14, 15, 16 & 17), now I'm depressed.
There's 4 more episodes?! .O.
I AM OF MISSLED!
haha, CR do that so much, you watch 12 episodes of something and if you don't carefully read the comments and reviews you never realise there's actually a prequel series and 4 episodes left of the series you watched...Damn licensing...
New episode, March 27, 2013. FUCK EVERYTHING, WUT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO?

Theres 4 new episodes on another website


pretty sure kyuil was joking
They were only able to sort out there problems because of what heartseed did to them.
I could watch this an infinite amount of times and still love it.
After a few hundred anime you really do wonder why these wonderful stories are not understood more widely, much to heartfelt I think. These artists are at the peak!
Well said. I couldn't agree more. We are in a Renaissance of sorts for the science of love.
Anime is the only medium of today that is able to portray love and tragedy to me in a way that really touches my heart and makes me think, I've become too accustomed to the reality to be satisfied by 'artistic' realism. neo-romanticism ftw
why isnt michi random on here? T_T
CR no get licences for OVAs hombre.
Crunchyroll! *shakes fist*
Is this it? Aw man~ i found episodes 14-17 online tho. Is there going to be an episode 18? I REALLYYYYY hope so!
This is one of those anime that you wish you could follow forever, like it's a part of your life. This one and Clannad
It is absolutely necessary for you who hasn't watched Kokoro Connect Michi Random to watch it! An absolute must watch! In love with Kokoro Connect! Amazing, super amazing anime!
I want more of Kokoro Connect!
I had extremely low expectations going into this. I was rather surprised at how it turned out. I am still disappointed at the end (99% of the Slice of Life shows I've seen end rather poorly), but the overall ride wasn't as bad as expected.
There a 4 more episodes in a seperate series called kokoro connect michi random. Go watch them. Also, this one ended badly because a scandal forced it to bee cut short, which makes me so sad cos I could watch seasons on end of this!
its now 7/26/2013. no season 2?
Crunchyroll.... please add the other 5 episodes... .>.>
4
You know, if it wasn't for that stupid prank that Silver Link pulled, we might've had another season of this piece of art. Alas.
TT_TT
What I don't understand is, why aren't the last 4 episodes on crunchyroll???
this ending is bull shit... I NEED MORE!!!
