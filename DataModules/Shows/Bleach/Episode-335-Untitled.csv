The Vizords and Ichigo's & Ishida's dad are the laziest bunch of people ever.
No kidding. And where are Jinta, Ururu, Ririn, Cloud, and Nova?
It's probably a union thing.
@my other post *past, not last
The visored made it pretty clear they had no intention of helping the soul society, the only reason they helped with aizen is they all hated him.
Just collect the 7 dragon balls and ask for his power back, duh~
2014, anybody? =w=

Haha, i lost my shit.
Are you guy living in the past smh?
Give Kon a combat body already...
I dunno... he seems to be fighting better as a stuffed animal... xD
All the other mod souls have bodies but I think they are anime only characters!
what he needs is a bigger rock
This is good filler. Just be glad it's not Don Kanonji.
Omg that guy cracks me up he's so stupid
Alright they put Grimmjow in the credits (best Espada ever) Kon is cool...nuff said and they should put him in a actual body so he could fight too, doesnt he have like super strength/power or something?
He is a mod soul spirit energy at least the strength of a 7 to 4th seat in power. he beat higher lvl hollows b4 yep he needs a body of his own, also the other 3 that came with him neew body with the humans the city would need no soul reaper
he severely needs a body, I mean to put into perspective he'd be equal to ishida(before he gets help from his dad) or chad without his second arm, but that is just strength wise... he'd be incredibly fast if he got the right body.
If you think legs arent enough for fighting you obviously havent played as chun li in street fighter
Kon could use kickboxing then if he had a body
I like how they act like there aren't about a few hundred other soul reapers who together could probably take on the injured time controlling guy.
Kon can cry since he absorbed all that water from the rain.
I wonder why they don't ask the vizards for help o . o since he can't manipulate hollow reshi
nozomi is cute with her soul reaper outifit
Been watching too much Naruto. Keep thinking Ishida is Sasuke...
rukia so short standing next to renji at the end
Im confused about the physics of Bleach. How do they bleed? If theyre invisible/incorporeal how do they affect the real world? They have these big battles how come no cops come to see what's causing the damage? I love the show just asking.
their death gods humans can't see them unless they have a lot of spirit pressure so they exist in the real world but invisible

ichigo is awesome.
Dude this is getting really intense.....
i like ichigo in white.......kon needs a gigai so he can help out
Kon is a stuffed animal... Even though he has a mod soul inside him... how the hell does he cry?
Gotta love Grimmjow's rape face at the end. >:D
Whats up with the ending video? They bringing them back or just fuckin with us?
I miss Grimmjow Crackerjack...
