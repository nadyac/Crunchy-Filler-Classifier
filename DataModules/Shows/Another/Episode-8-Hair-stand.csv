there's always a beach episode....
dont forget the hotsprings episodes
This was nowhere near being fanservice. Go watch HOTD, that's fanservice. Only the anime community would bitch about about a girl wearing a swimsuit. I guess going to a beach in real life would be considered too sexualized for you stiffs.
Change the name of the city to Raccoon City, drop a nuclear bomb on the entire city and say it was a zombie abyss and that it had to go. happy eating....brains
Of course there's a beach episode, Japan is one big island. All they have is cities, mountains, and beaches. And mountains are boring apparently.
Well, by the looks of it we're going to have a mountain episode as well.
Well I think the answer is very simple... We should take Yomiyama... and PUSH it somewhere else!
LOLOL!!! xD

YES!!!!!!! hahaha!!
LOOL!
@SetsunaHeart: Yeah, the people at Heavenly Host were a lot more rational than these guys. "Half a class dies every year. What do we do?" "Let's pretend this whole thing doesn't exist."
Things to avoid: pointy umbrellas, stairs, elevators, glass panes, heart attacks, knives, aaand the ocean itself, and boats. Maybe giant tanker trucks too.
no.. u guys forgot the most important part..... AVOID GOING TO SUCH CREEPY SCHOOLS..FOR GODS SAKE!!!
All this time and no one mentioned the wind? blew over that glass almost killed whats her face now it blew away a ball and got him ran over. The Wind is the real enemy here.
I think one of the people with them is the another, only reason I can think of that it would happen away from town RIGHT after they talk about how to stop it.
@interwebs Don't forget propeller to the face
Death is like the wind...always by my side.
PLEASE BE A WATERMELON, PLEASE BE A WATERMELON, PLEASE BE A WATERMELON! at that first scene
XD
Why.. Why didn'te he just LEAVE THE FREAKING BALL BEHIND? You could buy some for a dollar.. And I knew he would die.............
But the ball is a ball!
He couldn't help it. Guys are really attached to their balls.
@dark_paradox_21 *slow claps* Well played good sir....well played...
But seriously! If I was them I wouldn't be taking any risks like swimming so far out. I thought at least one of them would call out and tell him to come back but no one did. They just froze with fear.
Ball is life

lol they gave him sand boobies xD any1 else hold thier breathe in suspense when the truck passed them o.o
Definitely.

I did to its like who's it gonna kill
It was a very "Final Destination" moment there with the truck. but these types of shows always have false scares.
I thought the people in the limo were gonna die
First Scene, MASSIVE SPLASH OF BLOOD. me "well now, obviously the kool aid man is next"
that was probably the only time the Kool-Aid guy ever had the thought of "oh no"
OH YEAH!!!
XD
You'd really think they would have just closed the school by this point...
one would think, but you know, schools make money, Sooo...ya
It's a public school...
No one else knows about the calamity, it's just a rumour. You don't close schools because of a rumour.

trying to figure out who would go that far out for a ball that costs a dollar....
Well the balls wasn't far at first and he felt safe since they were out of town and then it appears he got some sort of cramp or something that disabled him.
Also had to run after it while Matsunaga was trying to explain stuff - you know, the whole reason they came there in the first place!
That's what you get for swimming just after you ate food.

While watching this show I can't help but feel that there are hints everywhere that I'm just too dumb to understand or completely notice.
you will understand everything on the second watch
Second watch?! Haha. Hahahahahahahahahahaha.
Second watch? haha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Watch me sob through the rest of the series and then decide if I can last a rewatch.
I understand every little hint absorb it and if its useless than w.e if its not then it makes sense later you cant watch these shows and not know how to pick up hints EXAMPLE: higurashi. confusing till season 2 unless you listen well.
I think Mei Misaki is dead. Her skin is so damn pale and that would explain why the family struggles at relating. That doll must have been made for her, not her little sister. It's gotta be her! But I hope I'm wrong, cause I like her. Ahh!
That last part was a bit fucking cheese. Really, you know you are about to die at any point and you go chase a 2 dollar ball into the ocean.
They said you are safe if you leave the town so it was a reasonable thing to do. I think after it went too far out he should have stopped though. Then again that might just be my fear of the ocean talking.
Well to me it looked like he got pulled out by the undertoe (when he first went under)
spoiler alert anurok jesus!
Still, after experiencing so much death, how could anyone still have the audacity to go so deep into the ocean? If I were him, or anybody else in the class for that matter, I wouldn't go so far as to even tie my shoelaces improperly.
rules for living in Another...dont do stupid things...if it looks sketchy just walk away
Nice Boat.
School Days reference huh?
Squid Girl Doesn't approve of this.
If people in this anime would just hear me out,NOBODY WOULD DIE!
meh he wasn't important right? Also these kids are going to be in therapy for YEARS!
Nah, they wont Even remember a thing, which is the problem
This is so much 'The Final Destination' of anime.
The Final Destination has nothing on Another.
Yea, on a geek note, in Final Destination they knew the order and "possibly" how they died. On a real note Another is just better.
