I love the loyalty in this anime!
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
OK so there is a graveyard for Dragons and People THIS PALACE IS F**K UP!!!
I would love to see a Mavis prequel.
Guest Pass AZTFQKWS36W. Enjoy!
Btw the Mavis prequel has 3 chapters now: Fairy Tail Zero
The Animation looks GREAT to Me.
I have the largest crush on Mavis for some reason, and I don't know why... :<
Fairy Tail Zero
Lol after they start falling Lucy continues to change.
tis how a pro does it, gravity's not an issue
Too bad she put her top on first *cries*
Well, that's anime gravity for you. What did you expect, rocket scientists making animes?
Looks like Sting learned the same move to kill Cheetu in HxH hahhaha
Rofl
I think that was more vertical

Thinking the exact same thing lol, ultra head smash.
Damn, Marvis is one cute, bad-ass.
Yeah umm ok so a ghost is guiding them now that's what makes Mavis a bad ass even though she is a ghost she can still co-ordinate and make strategies to help her fairy tail win
Mavis gave me chills this episode!
I still don't think we've gotten an explanation about why she is a ghost...
DethAssass1n: You mean besides the "I'm dead" thing. I think they needed someone to help locate the TI island and she wasn't busy, and then used her as an interesting passive character for the games. "But why is she back?" Because they CAN.
Not cheating, more like found a loophole.
THE EPICNESS BEGINS!!!!!!!!
And this is why Fridays are fucking awesome.
Fairy Fridays or Badass Fridays!!
f***ing fantastic fridays
Gray vs. Rufus *throws off shirt* Im so in!

She is not just adorable but extremely Smart. +1 to First Guild Master
24:13 .....was that really necessary? XD that pic of Lucy had absolutely nothing to do with the preview lol!
Lol, Nothing involving Fairy Tail is unnecessary. Go ahead Mashima!! Make as many lewd pictures of Lucy as you want!!!!
...theres going to be a riot in japan, and some okatu is going to get arrested, then s, hes going to be defeated on his knees,with a camera is facing him and a crowd is watching,then he looks into the sky and does the fairy tale thing
I was wondering that myself...Thought I'd missed something but nope just lucy in a swimsuit.
lol its obvs gonna be in the next episode, its somewhat a recurring joke where lucy tries to get things to go her way by acting sexy and fails.
Natsu go get your woman!
Nalu leads for the best pairing for everyone
I want NaLu.Lisanna doesn't have enough heart or determination to be with Natsu
^Well that or she shows up about as much as Bisca... Totally thought that she would have been more important after they were reunited.
Lisanna!
@randy1925 - no, the Eclipse arc is filler, because it's not in the manga and was made to allow the manga time to get ahead. That's what filler is. Quality has no bearing on it.
Mavis is awesome I heard she's getting a spin off prequel I hope it's true!
Mavis the Fairy Tactician is kawaii, wise and the MEGA BO$$!!!
I think Mavis needs an arc about her. But my speculation is that she has something to do with Zeref, they are from the same time I think. So I think we will find out more about her then.
Yea, she is getting one, but I don't think it's going to get animated, it's unfortunately staying as a manga i think. But lets hope for an animation to come out for it
The Mavis prequel manga has been confirmed, and it will be done by Mashima as well... because he just has that much energy.
My weekly dose of Fairy Tail has arrived, I'm all fired up!
Can't they have Happy, Charle, and Pantherlily fly them back? Over the castle walls too?
Mentioned in first ever episode Happy can only carry one person. So 5 people, cats only able to carry at max 4 so someone will be left alone. Fairy Tail wouldn't do that. So they stick together.
That and one of them( no not Wendy) is a little... heavier than the others.
Meeda-Nii can also fly while in Satan Soul form, as can Natsu with his wings of flame (but that power has been forgotten since way back when). Anyway, for the plot they needed the Fairy idiots to be stuck in the dungeon so they will remain.
@ranjib I agree with you on this one Meeda-Nii can fly in Satan Soul carry Lucy, the cats pick up Natsu, etc. but is not going to happen
does the princes not realize that she just locked a fire breathing dragon under her castle
The OP and ED is just getting me hyped to see if Lucy and Natsu fall in love, i haven't read the manga yet but i am defiantly planning on it!

DBZ shows that shounen doesn't have to ignore maturation (Goku & Chichi). Rave Master's ending shows the same, in a surprisingly touching finish. Romance may not be the focus, but the manga title pages often show Natsu & Lucy together.
yea they have hope to be together ...........just like brock and misty D=
Read Mashima's Rave Master it's shounen and the main girl and guy do get together in the end, plus I think they are very similar to Natsu and Lucy.
Brock and Misty Da Faq!?!
im so happy this is back
Yay fairy tail hehe
I'm starting to like the new art style more and more now. So much closer to the manga!
yeah it really is, at the start ppl were bitching but I like it better! Guess it takes getting used to!
Didn't even notice before I started rewatching the first episodes again x)
I like it but Happy looks funky, he's not as cute as before.
It is higher quality so it is a little weird to what we are used to
Love the CR translations!!!! always worth waiting for
lol, worth waiting 30 minutes
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 Finally!
this went by too fast
it is just the start. it gets slower as they build it up
