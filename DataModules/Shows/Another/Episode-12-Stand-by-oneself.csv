it would really suck to get held back a year lol
The day I watched the episode where the guy had the asthma attack, I also got one ;/ Luckily I didn't die though But anyway, did that guy even die or did he get to the hospital in time?
It didn't say in the series but in the original book he gets to the hospital and lives.
Wasn't that him in the hospital at the end?
benjelo, from what i saw, it looked like he was in the back of the teachers truck, maybe they killed him?
yeah he shows up as the guy who walks in the room in the hospital scene. glad he lives
New job for Mei.. every year just walk into the classroom and find the dead one and take them out back... old yeller style.
They could simply have 2 really big class 1 and 2s, avoiding renaming class 3/pretending class 3 was class 4.
I had the same thought. I would think the locals would be more than willing to pay her an annual salary as full time Class 3 Countermeasures Faculty.. and woe unto the poor souls who just happened to be really sick .. now and then..
But if they did that we wouldnt get to see this^
stuttrboy i agree with you but since the last saver recorded how to do it but mei can do it too right guys? Well
Won't work since the guy who stopped the calamity the first time couldn't even remember doing it, next year Mei would have forgotten this experience 1337larry Mei only knew that killing the dead ends the calamity after they got to the hotel
I liked the part when Kouichi got hit by that piece of wood and brushed it off like it was nothing :3 /playback 5:57
sociopaths lack a conscience and feel little emotion... psychopaths act on emotion without thinking.... definitely psychopath... beyond sociopathic makes it sound like it's less scary... i would honestly fear a socio more than a psycho.

To an extreme sociopath, you might as well be an inanimate object. Whether you're a pebble in their shoe, a harmless ladybug, or a vending machine that dispenses two candy bars is up to you. They're by far the scarier of the two.
I disagree. Sociopaths are predictable, and I know a few personally. The lack of any feeling of connection to other people does not make someone inherently dangerous. Some of the most brilliant thinkers of all time have been sociopaths.
Psychopaths on the other hand, have an altered perception of reality and can act in unpredictable and erratic ways. Someone who sees and hears things that do not exist and might mistake me for a monster of some sort, is much more terrifying
Parents: "Should have never signed that damned permission slip..."
If my dad saw it he would go " Damn, no more child support? " and sign it anyway
That is hilarious in the most horrible way possible...
Keksimonsteri: In the book, it does a really good job on not letting you know that Mikami is Reiko so I'm very happy that the anime did a great job on it too.
I liked that show, but I never noticed that his aunt and Mikami were the same person :O
uhhhhhhhhhhh what guys. in the last episode Ms. Mikami died the teacher one after "send the dead back to death" and then students came out to kill mei but she was killed but theres 2 realy what the heck Is it possible that there are 2 dead?
She didn't die at that moment, she was just wounded. It was done so you would suspect her less if you thought she was already dead and the calamity didn't stop though.
you could also see her walking around after the building burst into flames.
me either, I felt really stupid ;x
I don't think they looked alike at all I mean the hair color was diffren't did she die her hair every morning before class then wash it off before we saw her at his grandparents house?

holy shit my chromosomes restored in ten seconds when i finished reading these comments
have none of you guys seen the movie Backdraft with i think kurt russel from the 90's..... sheeeeez
ya also dont forget about back drafts and flashovers i mean in reality they all would have died.
It was build by michael bay.

MIsaki should become the class three teacher, problem solved for a long time.
"I hate being questioned" Don't think she's cut out for being a teacher.

@AmuRosecross the calamity continues as long as there is a dead person to take up the extra spot. Considering how frequent death is in this place, the calamity aint goin nowhere.
But then she'd have to go through a process of consent to kill a student. Do you realize how hard it'd be to convince parents that their child is already dead?
She wouldn't have to have consent. Just kill the student. The parents wouldn't remember the kid and with real memories would return.
"This is not normal." That man is badass.
he was the teacher 15 years ago, he had to have known about the tape and who it was the whole time. now WHY didnt he stop it?
He wouldn't have known, because the person that was killed was never remembered, because he was the dead person. Also, the person who made the tape hid it, so there was no way that the librarian would have known
He was the teacher 26 years ago. I believe the teacher's name 15 years ago was Kouga or something like that. It was mentioned a couple episodes back when the field trip was being explained. I believe it was on the first part of the tape.
I was thinking more along the lines of "Captain Obvious."
Teacher commits suicide in front of class nope still normal.
"This is not normal." UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR!!!!
No, understatement of the century.

actually sniper if you had noticed right when he killed reiko it went to like a 4 frames shot to his rib cage and lungs then it jumped to a zoomed out shot and shows him collapsing holding his chest
@sniper15 does anything misaki do make any sense? also to anybody who is seeing this.........Ask urself '' Is my class cursed,Should i go on any future feild trips? '' if u asked ur self that then think on this....'' Why am I laughing? ''


kouichi was probably just running on adrenaline... and it's too bad that red haired girl died, she only wanted to be remembered but it couldn't happen cuz reiko died that year and memories altered... who knows mb he will remember her later.
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT WATCHED THE LAST LITTLE CLIP AFTER THE CREDITS?

That must mean that they remember what happened. Either they also remember Reiko or they realized someone must have died who was the extra and decided to share the fact that that's how you stop the curse
I saw it, I always wait till the end because anime likes to add scenes after the credits

I think only people personally involved remember, Mei and Kouichi. They probably remembered everything that happened. Its only said that the dead person is forgotten not events, though they probably will forget at some point.

You're right it did look like Sakakibara. Perhaps the killer was his father and he fled the country after murdering Reiko. Thus explaining why he truly was in India the whole time.

Yukito Ayatsuji needs to hurry up writing Another 2
No, Its Another Another.
You escape thy chandelier; By pillar thee suffer!!!
Oh man, the pillar falling on the guy at the beginning made me lol XD
I'm FREE!!! squush
Haha. That one made me laugh too. "I'm going to make it out alive!!" Lol nope.
IKR!!
[This comment has been removed]
Turns around to look at fallen chandelier that killed other classmates. Doesn't check on any of them. Tries to save himself. Crushed brutally. Help people.
to me it looked like kouichi killed reiko in the past o-O
[This comment has been removed]
OR it was the dad since we never saw him
idk about the killer, but the dad said kouichi was there a year and a half ago, his memories weren't altered since he was in india. If he weren't so irresponsible and the signal in that area weren't so bad..
Actually when the dad asks about 1 year and a half ago kouichi corrects him that he hadnt been there at that time and the dad is all like ''oh yeh yer right MAN india is hot *hangs up*''
It is quite an interesting theory that his dad is the killer. I find it entirely possibly but we will most likely never know, I guess its just one of those things the writer leaves to the reader or it was a coincidence :p
No one in this anime has a sense of urgency. Who just walks through a burning building filled with psychopathic killers??
Koichi stood in the middle of a room of fire on his cell phone for 10 minutes. XD
Koichi even brushed off a piece of wood caught in fire off his shoulder like it was nothing. Lol
so do mei and koichi hook up or what.


Apparently the writer is making a spin-off AND a sequel. SO FINGERS CROSSED PEOPLE!!!
u guys r so thirsty xD
well, 1998-2013, 15 years, so they would be almost 30, kind of like the aunt or that guy who accidentally killed the another 13 years earlier. creepy.....
@10:59 Wouldn't it be funny if right then his dad called him to complain about how hot it was in India?
LMAO
maybe the call about heat was foreshadow-ment for the call in the end with the fire? anyone make that connection that there may be a fire and he may use his phone. BLANK FILLED.
I am so mind blown right now

Remember kids, Classmates shouldn't be doing stupid things like killing each other. Cuse knowledge is power
