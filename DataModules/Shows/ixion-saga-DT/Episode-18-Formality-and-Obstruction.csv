Economic arguments, oh noes.... That was a unique take on the grope-fall, I have to say.

Little did those two know that this small incident would have a large influence on the events to come. = )
you know that whenever Incognito shows up you're in for some laughs and this ep was no exception, that ending haha

"Stop, you're hurting the innocent black market dealer" Haha! What kind or Irony is that!? And wow, that moment between Marian and Erec was just...wow. I always had that thought in the back of my head.
I love this episode , its just too silly . I stll cant get over the fact Mariandel is voiced by Jun , he is so good.
And thus, let the greatest love story of all time begin.
Black market for dominoes? LOL. Definitely shipping Erec-sama and Marian now. I never realized how they fit together till now.
Still laughing on how much of a trap Mariandale is after 18 episodes.
This is show is so funny. I can't stop laughing.
LMAO. A match made in heaven!
9KTWGDH7GYN gift pass! grab it while its hot!
I don't think grab is the word you want to use here.
it is definitely the word you want to use here
i love marian
My brain... again.
Ugh....This show is so stupid . And yet I keep watching it. Why!? I see the new episode sitting there, beckoning me to watch. I already know what I'm going to think of it, and I watch it anyway. It has lived up to my expectation every time
So Nabokov is marrying a loli....I love that a show with so many ball jokes also has this kind of literary reference.
