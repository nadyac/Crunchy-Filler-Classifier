I guess Gajeel just couldn't stand being overSHADOWED by Natsu, Laxus, and everybody else. LOL
team4axis, YOU ARE AWESOME!
maybe Rouge should try stepping out of everyobe else's SHADOW!
speaking of shadows did every one else stand still untill sunset man 0.o they did not move at all
Looks like Gajeel likes fighting from the shadows.
NICE
I just realized, If Gildartz was in the tournament... he would mess shit up.
if gildart was in the tourment and it was this last event. Everyone would be running the other way. But there be no more city left. So gildart just walk up to them and they blow up!
would gildarts even be allowed in? he used to be guild master, though it lasted like 5 minutes
I'd like to see Gildarts and Jura duke it out.
Gildarts and Jura. Jura may be one of the Ten Great Wizard Saints but Gildarts is a freaking boss! Jura would lose in less then a minute.
That Gildarts used to be guild master logic wouldn't apply. Just look at Sting, he became the guild master, but is still fighting, i mean participating, wait... He is there somewhere as a contestant.

Welcome to the land of the Cliffs of Dover, where everyone gets to hang around for a week only to get up for less than a half hour at a time...
Extreme Lightning? More like Extremely Misleading Title......
yeah I thought I would see both of the lighting users fighting I was waiting on that but this fight seems like it might be even better.
Laxus is such a beast
It takes more than one shot to destroy Laxus gee heee
"Sometimes you need to look down too because the other guy might be at your feet" ~ Laxus
that was a cool moment right there
^ agreed!
That punch even hit me x_x
For all of you guys wondering, Laxus' coat flew away with the wind because it has the ability to fly
A wild Jura appeared! Laxus's coat ran away!
freaking gajeel. freaking laxus. freaking FAIRY TAIL. my jaw dropped so many times this episode I lost count >.>
Next stop, the hospital to relocate the dislocated jaw of yours?
You and the commentators at 05:17
My jaw hurts from hitting the floor so much... owowowowow
OKAY I love the animation, I really do. This episode was badass ...........but the only problem is that.....WHY THE HELL DID THEY TAKE AWAY EVERGREEN'S LIPSTICK!!!!???? she doesn't look right sheesh
Loke has cat ears in manga too
it is staying more ture to the manga?
the new animation definitely took some getting used too
Loke's cat ears are the opposite of a problem :3
nmorris I agree
Fastest 22 minutes of my life.
I wish I didnt find out about fairy tail until 300 episodes, these ciffhangers must be binge watched.

Laxus isn't taking your shit Jura!
lol the first time I saw Fairy Tail was on netflix...first 48 episodes and so that's when I bought Collection 1 & 2. Come Crunchy Roll, totally didn't know that there was over 180 episodes and so what did I do for the next few days? Watch!
thats what she said
Lol at lyon. Cheria take care of Juvia but don't hurt her. XD how do u do that.
I feel bad for Rogue first Natsu kicked his ass a day ago now Gajeel today tomorrow it will be Wendy LOL!
And then Happy will too
I like Rogue
Stupid fat finger ... wasn't done with my comment... I like Rogue, was the only member of Sabre Tooth I liked. Glad his role in the story isn't over even though this episode kind of made it look like it was.
Oh that was AWESOME!!! Laxus has change so much I'm so glad he got that good whooping like 100 eps ago to see him become this Laxus!!! Epic fight next week! BTW idk why but every time I see Juvia I'm expecting an Oooooooh Gray-sama!!! LMAO!
who isn't expecting that. xD

im sure they replaced people. I mean atleast hes super strong now... you remember how piss ass weak he was originally all hype for him and he got his ass beat by a clown.
@Crimsonreignx true, he fights a lot smarter now and he is a lot stronger now.
There's also the 7 year gap, Jura might be on par with Makarov now
Fairy tail Friday's...
may they continue forevermore....
they will continue until i die. well atleast i hope e.e
^what if it was a cliffhanger and you just die before you saw the next episode.
Gajeel is probably the best, I mean cmon his dragon form....also he reminds me of vegeta, dont you think?
Except he doesn't get his ass kicked the first 3 minutes of the figh, he's actually useful and can stand alone.
lol and a blue haired gal pal by his side? Very much like Vegeta ;P
I think a God Slayer just got downplayed. I mean, sure Jura's strong and all, but that could have had a bit more length.
no orga was 3845 and jura was around 8k and canna was over 9000
I was hoping Orga would of put much more of a fight he went down easily and embarrassed the other god slayers. I mean Cheria fights a lot smarter and has really shown the power of a god slayer. Orga gets taken down by a counter attack......
1. It's Jura. 2. Orga was going to lose to Laxus anyway, no if and or but about that one. 3. It was an amazingly, hilarious scene. 4. Ktfo.
It was also agreed upon, at least in Orga's mind I think, that Jura was going to stand there and take the hit. If you get smacked in the face without any time to prepare yourself, you are going to blackout.
Yeah, Orga took too long to charge up his spell, enough time for Jura to just knock him out. I mean, Orga fooled himself thinking a wizard saint is gonna risk getting ko'd standing there
Ladies and gentlemen, Gajeel just entered a new level of badass
The battle that I have been waiting to watch is not in this episode. I hope we get the full fight next episode.
Laxus is amazing. He always has something awesome to say. The writers really give him good lines.
Go Laxus, go!!! I had goosebumps during that fight - I've been waiting SO long to see this!!
Loki and his flirting habits....I lol'd.
He got rejected on the spot D:
no he didn't she was just playing hard to get
In what way, LordRiceball?
