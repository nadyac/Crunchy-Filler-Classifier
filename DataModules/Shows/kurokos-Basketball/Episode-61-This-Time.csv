The hospital bills from getting hit by cars must be crazy.
Kagami Shakespeare on his new drama, The Basketlet. "To ball or not to ball. That is the question"
His response to the question would be, "Of course! To ball! Anytime, anywhere!"
This is skill LOL

You know when Kuroko says "Um..." Seirin's got this in the bag.
I'd definitely rather be 2 weeks behind and watch it on good quality on crunchyroll. Well worth it.
Totally. Even though I've read the manga, I still find it hard to wait though haha
I'm trying my best not to read the manga. So far, it's all worth it. Lol
for those that want to watch in HD now 6BBBETA7SLV
Kagami's new JDrama - coming to Crunchyroll in the near future.
"Kagami's lame line got me thinking of something" LOL only Kuroko
Why does the episode have to end with 30 seconds left on the clock!!
Kagami must of played Final Fantasy X.
@18:33 Aomine ghost coming to haunt Kagami for his revenge on his lost against him
*LOL** Not just Aomine... :XP It's both Kise and Aomine~~~ :XD
Kagami trying desperately to break the 4th wall
Let's hope Kuroko can save the day again >.<
Kise is really difficult to stop considering that he combines the moves of the GoM and Kuroko's passes. He is 5 dudes in 1 deluxe package!
With a bit more endurance practice and a healthy foot, it is hard to see how he can be beaten in the future!
I think he is too smart though, yeah he can use all of the abilities. The real pain is that he always chooses the best one for every situation he somehow became as smart as Akashi.
@Moneeb23.. ^_^ Oh Dear... I think 7dudes.. Kise's jersey #7 matches well~ ^_^ Seven dudes in one including himself... ^_^ Because Kise can copy Kagami too... *Lol* GoM is five... + Kuroko is six... + Kagami is seven~ :XP
It's our story.
When both sides were chanting I felt like someone should have yelled, LOLLAPALOOZA!
As a person who HATES basketball, but loves sports animes, I wanna pick up a basketball and shoot some baskets right now.
There is still one skill in Kuroko I have not seen Kise copy yet.. Maybe will get to see it in next epi.. ^_^ Did you see how closely Kuroko is watching Kise???? WOW... Kuroko eyes kinda awesome there..... ^_^
