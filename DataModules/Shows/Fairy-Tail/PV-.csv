I am so excited
@Matt7157: You're lucky! I wish I could watch it all fresh and from the beginning. ^.^
I cant sit still! Its back! Its really BACK!!
hm it seems to have an Irish Jig to it
That's just your heart dancing.
Is the original Fairy tail series here on crunchyroll? can't seem to find it
I am so happy Crunchyroll got this!
I hope they also get season 1. I would rewatch all over again in the highest quality. Love this show.
there so should id watch it none stop
Thank you TV Tokyo Fairy Tail & Crunchyroll
Yay! So happy!!!
THE HYPE IS REAL. Can you feel it?
Those chills just by watching this pv. This is going to be epic!!
Aye Sir!
you got that right!
For people who are confused on if this is a reboot or not, it's not. It's a continuation of the anime. So think of this as episode 176.

best news i have heard all day :)))))) no scratch that all year
Alright now lets get the first season as well.
Most of the first season is on Netflix, unlikely that anything other than what they have will ever show up there though. I think half of the first season, if its even that much.

It will be nice to wake up tomorrow and be able to watch Fairy Tail to start off my morning.
yes oh lord baby yes
These are tears. Actual tears.
YES FINALLY, I was so sad they announce they stop airing episodes. but now I'm ALL fired up! can't wait for this season! CES45AGAXQ3
