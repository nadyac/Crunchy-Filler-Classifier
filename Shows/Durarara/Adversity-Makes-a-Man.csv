and i thought Shizuo was going to drive the car and chase them...... I am out of my mind lol
As hilarious as it was, you have to admit it was a smart move; he can chase the enemy whilst avoiding bullets!

CHAPTER 1 FINISHED MUHWAHAHA
Shizuo doesn't have a license so driving it would be illegal.
Well, grondor, what is the difference between kidnapping women and kidnapping men? I don't see how ovaries makes one exempt from kidnapping.
Erika sure knows how to fondle a girl.
so jealous of Erika right now
@bloodraevynn Actually, she was just trying to catch her breath from laughing so hard
So . . . Anri is ticklish? *makes copious notes*
Takes one to know one
Of course she does XD! I mean, pretty much the only ones who know how to do that properly are only other girls, especially girls in anime, lol!
Someone out trolled Izaya. O_O
So much "HOLY SHIT" in this episode WHEW!!! *Mind Explosion*
Yep. Mind explosion. Feel the EXACT same way.
His explosiveness is far greater than I had foreseen...
I hate you izaya..but i love you...but i hate you
I feel like Izaya might be some kind of antihero or something. Then again, I feel like every group could be some kind of antihero in this show.

I will still ship them.
The fan fiction that will be made because they finally bumped into each other. . . *shivers* I'm hiding.
Doujin writers everywhere are scripting how Shizuo rescues the Russian Ice Princess and a ship sets sail. Well, I hope that's what they're doing because I really want to see it
I just love how a massive, all-out brawl suddenly became a rather sedate "Hey, how you doing?" moment as soon as Shizuo arrived with a motorcycle over his shoulder. It shows how well-known he is.
Izaya shall conquer all!!!
This walks the line between light and dark. And it does so fabulously. Of course, I'd expect nothing less... Also Mikado has a new pen pal. Lololol Okay I'll stop typing now...
Holy shit I could not believe that! Woo! Mikado has just rocketed himself up as the most interesting character in the show! I love how the characters can be so developed even after being somewhat static in the first season!!!

Maybe The Dark Knight has changed me, because the moment I saw the visual focus on the pen, I saw this coming. Didn't make it any less awesome or satisfying though.

DO NOT MESS WITH ANRI! WOO! My jaw hit the floor and I JUMPED out of my chair! OMG! I knew he had an unusual amount of composure and drive just by looking at him (he looked kinda like Masaomi honestly) but DAMN! Dat blood contract dou! 0_o
The pen thing surprised me. It's when he went back to his usual self so fast that scared me. The kid is loosing it; this should be fun to watch.
I was like "YEASSS! Hes Stopped being a wussie and grew some"! But then he went back to his normal self and I was like "OMFG did they fall of or did the y get sucked beack up wtf why? WHY!?!?! TURN BACK NOW".
To be continued....in July!
I was really engaged this episode and at one point thought this episode seemed quite longer than usual. Then the credits came in and ' chapter 2 in July' damn I thought it was 13 episodes. Cant wait that long, OK well it's not that long.
I really enjoyed this even though it didn't seem like it lasted too long. Good thing I have decent series this spring or I wouldn't survive till July! ><
@DreadedFate007 If you thought it was only going to be 13 episodes long, you'll be pleased to know there's another 24 episodes coming, 12 starting again in July, and then another 12 coming next January.
^ you misunderstood me, I've known that there was going to be three cours before this season started. I just thought the first cour of chapter 1 was going to be 13 episodes not 12.
hurry up July..... HURRY.
Shizuo is such a badass in this episode I can't even handle it.
wait! there was an episode where Shizuo was not badass?
^There are episodes where he doesn't appear, and then episodes where he is a badass.
Dude, if we're talking about badasses, Mikado is the newest entry! Holy Hell!!!!
Calmly displaying his rage, then apologizing. Those guys don't know what they've gotten themselves into. Subarashi!
I think he realized he fucked up when he saw the two faced Ryugame.
I still can't believe that shit just happened....just..beyond words 0_o
Never thought a car could be used as a soccer ball.

like him or not, it is apparent that he sent that little girl to Shizou for protection. What is this fight that Izaya got himself mix up in?

He kinda just did...

@eroose - You mean better.
@khaosknightzero we mean totally batshit insane -- which I suppose *is* better in some people's minds.

WALKER OPENED HIS EYES

Holy shit that ending :O
Holy shit that whole epsiode 0_o
Holy shit this entire anime! but yeah.... holy shit that ending.

Honestly I think this is one of the few shows that would get anyone hooked. It reminds me of every successful TV series america has put out in the past decade. You know if Izaya messes up something big is going to happen.
sign this contract, (oh it must be on the other side of this blank page, let me just flip it over to sign) BAMM. Very sly, Very sly
Still freaking out about it 0_o
July is such a long wait to watch Celty be awkward and adorable.
