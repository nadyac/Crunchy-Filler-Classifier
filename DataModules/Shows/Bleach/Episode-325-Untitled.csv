and another girl joins Ichigo's harem
Byakuya is way too cool.
Yes... but you see Ichigo took care of 6 Reigai at once... and it seems as though everybody else is having a lot harder time defeating them. Just saying...
recape ends @ 02:30
ichigo is a sucker for girl's in danger
i know why everyone rebels in soul society. it must get pretty boring being around for hundreds or thousands of years. they do it to spice things up.
yeah lol they also happen to do all the rebelling within the same 12 months
Hey once the party starts, you gotta keep it going.
This comment chain is brilliant :'D
is it me or does chad look like hes 40 in this
Lol Kon called Ishida a four-eyedsewing machine... BWaHAHAHA
I thought the flames from the blade of Old Man Yama were the hottest and most powerful but those 2 regai have been engulfed in it's flame like 100 times and are still standing?
Well those regai are suppose to be stronger than the originals. And you just know their creator must have done something to increase their resistance to the old man's flames.
D:< hate his green and blond hair, he just looks dumb
all the sweeter it will be when hes beaten ?
ohhh byakuya and his pride <3
That guy in the ending looks like Nagato.
omg omg omg i so love BYAKUYA <3!!!
Ya he's pretty damn sexy
The glow in Reigai-Toshiro's eye's suits him since he has blue eyes :D.
try green icy eyes ... lol
Go Kuchiki! <3
Byakuya and his pride XD lol

Byakuya vs Byakuya would be awesome if they fought though i think if they met they probably would just have tea together
And why did you watch this if you "don't care" about the anime anymore?
Everyone from Soul Society calls Kurosaki, Ichigo, & he just introducted himself to Nozomi as Ichigo, if you're going to have a girl that you have only known for some time call you by your first name then Let Orihime call you Ichigo too!
He already made it clear he doesn't mind her calling him by his first name, she is just too shy or something... Honestly i rather her call him Ichigo instead of Kurosaki. It annoys the crap out of me everytime I hear it.
I think its because she just respects him a lot. Uryuu is the same, always calls him Kurosaki, I know its different with Uryuu, but its still the concept of respect.
Inoue calls everyone by their last name
Never thought i would say this. But the filler is a bit more interesting than the main story right now.
