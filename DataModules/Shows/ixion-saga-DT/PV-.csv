Looks like the type of show where I would end up rooting for the villains...
Looks good, but it has big shoes to fill standing in the shadow of Sword Art Online
think I will give it a try =)
looks similar to Bleach,
look like its gonna be like dot hack sweet
10 to 0... 1.5... X_X
I will really decide after an episode or 2 just like New0mea.
This looks like an opening, not a preview. What.
I doubt it'll be able to compete with SAO but I still want to check this first ep out, it might be good...
@nastymochi: I'd say SAO is more of .hack on a larger scale as the main character is trapped in a similar state of being unable to log out and leave the game due to issues with the nuero connected video game he was playing.
Lol just from seeing that boys facial expressions I wanna watch this
Kinda bad PV but i guess i'll give it a shot
hmm that pv doesn't make me wanna watch it.
Hmmmm, not sure. Hah. Guess i'll check it out anyways just to see
This is a horrible preview, hopefully it is not a sign of the quality of the show.
Looks lame, but I'll definitely give it a chance.
Interesting
I'll pass judgement after I've see an episode or two,
