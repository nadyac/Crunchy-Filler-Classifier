actually like series its dubbed rare enough wonder crunchyroll like way art style done animation think its refreshing change pace usual fan service copycat anime were subjected still cant watch series but do enjoy listening animated storybook style puts off but turn off monitor all good story got kind weird bit but wasnt bad episode voice acting improved little bit over last episode able watch episode without right eye twitching some flatly delivered lines dear cr actually appreciate new premium content even though its dubbed technically not an anime end youve added value subscription look forward content updates daily please keep up fun
