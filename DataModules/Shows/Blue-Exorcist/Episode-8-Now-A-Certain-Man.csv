i'm just waiting for the one with the hoodie to bust out with destruction bugs or something like shino aburame
lol ghab... shino is a character from naruto
But everything comes from DBZ, right? /facepalm. twice.
Dang you since you mentioned that, I have been thinking that would be a fun thing to do.
Yeah I can't stop thinking what's up with that hoodie guy

I wish the kid with the puppet would be more involved in the shows, he seems like an "interesting" person x]
No seriously, do the hooded dude and the kid with the puppet serve a purpose other than make the class look bigger?
Each time I see the hooded person, I expect them to do something epic. Never happens. D: I hope it does soon~

^^^^^ loooooool
LOL funny because it true XD
Ahahaha true. Anyway, the manga reveals who the puppet guy is and you learn about hoodie in a few episodes.
I find it really funny how the guy opened the door saw the demon and then just casually closed it back. lolol XDDD
XDDDD
Awesome
am i the only one that wanted him to show everyone that he's a demon?
i think thats how everybody feels
PULL THE DAMN SWORD i said literally out loud

I always laugh whenever Rin shrieks like a monkey XD
lol epic battles! xD but..i wonder who that hooded guy is lol everyone wondering o.o and that puppet guy
I wanna learn more about the grey-hoodie guy and the bunny-puppet person.
Naw, it has to do with making Rin be the bridge between urmm...that name of the gate to the other name of that gate. Then, ultimately, we all get pancakes.
Gehenna gate and Assiah. i think thats the name of the gate from Hell to out mortal plane.
Nice teamwork. A+++. Rin needs a girl to have crush on him. Older bro and son of satan. Should of gotten all the ladies, but that doesn't seem to be the case unfortunately
Haahahahahaha!!!! I can't afford membership either. I'm actually grateful that this site has good quality anime to enjoy. I can stand a few commercials to watch some really good anime here. And me better than other people? HAHAHAHAH!!!!
it kind of bothers me that no one has questioned his pointy ears yet.

lol Close the door and it will go away I like that principle =P
Stop complaining about Ads. Jesus. Either shut up and pay the membership or shut up and not pay the membership. Easy as that! Btw, Great episode!
Lmao it's like nobody notices the guy with the hoodie
15:49 DAMN im gonna have a nightmare tonight T-T
lol, I watched this episode at 2am
5am here, still going. Not regreting it.
this has got to b the best opening/ending i have seen on any anime....at least i think so, and so is the songs
You should try Beck.The animation isn't that great but the story and music more than make up for it.
Rin For The Win XD
