I know Natsu isn't a pervert, but he really seemed to be enjoying Lucy in her swimsuit.
go Gajeevy
I liked the Gajeel x Levy pairing till I read your name fore them. It's almost as bad as Natsy.
NO, Gajeel x Levy is called Gale.
Wouldn't it be Gevvy or Lajeel? Where did the "le" come from?
It's the first to letter of each name. GaLe
Is it just me or did the announcer get more excited than the girls when gray took off his shirt...?
darth's comment and Cray's comment are pretty much the same thing, but one got disliked by almost 10 people and one got liked by 10 people...
The announcer is a loli remember the fight with wendy and shelia
"HE TOOK IT OFF!!!"
Odd tastes, he likes men and lolis.
@slarck Your pervi sensi dp is made your comment 100x better

Gray is like "MY HAT!!!"

LOL I took a screenshot of Gray with that hat on.
Why cant all men look that hot in wierd hats?
Rufus looks better in that hat than Gray does.
lol, Happy of course you'd suggest sexual appeal to get out of dungeon nobody has escaped xD FAIRY TAIL <3
when happy said he had an idea and it went to commercial I was yelling at my screen "Happy NO, NO IDEAS!!"
You say that Natsu isn't a pervert but can you explain why he carries bathing suite pictures of Lucy and Mirajane? I think he turned to a pervert during the ep where Gray and him saw Lucy naked from there he's been creepin lol
Happy's trolling lvl is over 9000!!!!! always trolling the women of fairy tail

@rampage22 I thought he wasn't carrying them but found some by those skeletons...
gray is the new librarian.... and a badass one at that.

Many fangirls hoped so at least.....
Oh my god, this ^^^
Nice Unlimited Blade Works reference at the end there
It was a total rip off lol. Oh well it amused me.
How did I not see that? This arc is full of game references. The only one I caught on my own was Blitzball, and that's cause I have near a thousand hours into FFX.
what was the reference o.o?
Ah, Fairy Tail, the reason Friday's are again the best day of the week.
For US it is on friday
I'd think you'd like Saturdays more because of one piece...
i honneslty simply don't know what to expect from mekaku.. ep. 1 and 2 were so different that i am unsure where it is going. but it does have potential

Why is everyone disliking the One Piece comments? How would you feel if people disliked your comment just because you like an anime they don't? How rude. >:(
I effin love the opening song !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would say this was a good spring break, watched every episode in time for the new one, I have no idea how I never watched this show before.
175 + the 4 new ones, at roughly 23 minutes each,around 68.5ish hours. You're a beast, *standing ovation*. I'd say that was time well spent = )
I have to admit -- I just did that too. Forgot when I started, like Tue or Wed. Needless to say, I've done nothing BUT. (~30 a day, w/ a 45 stint one time.) Just now hit real time. ToH, Deliora, Laxus, Edolas, Sirius Island, & now Eclipse
Since I've now caught up via an Archive Trawl (tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveTrawl) I think I'll go to sleep for a week (or 100 years - Infinity Clock, anyone? I need *that* as an wake-up alarm.) and let them jump ahead again.
@Pummy923 you and I must be on the same cycle. I just watched every FT episode during my summer recess (1 week) now back to college!!!
Library logic: return books after you read them. Rufus just killed common sense there.
dude the animators are shipping natsu x lucy so hard this season
what about natsu and lisann. they are ignoring their past history.
true, true
lols
Damn! Gray knocked him out AND stole his hat! Like a boss!
the op is just sooo good
I've really been spoiled by the brilliance of the fights from Hunter x Hunter...
Agreed!
If I could thumbs that comment up more than once, I would.
Eh, different strokes. These fights feel more action packed but far less dramatic.
Gray Gray, he's our man. If he can't do it no one can! Yayayayay
I actually sang this like a cheerleader >.<
Ditto. ( .___.)
