1st rule to fighting a party: kill the healer first.
The soul reapers need some kind of RPG training program...
Didn't this battle with the head captain start like 20 episodes ago... wake me up when the battle is finally over...
I don't think they have RPGs or MMOs in soul society... sucks for them!
cc dps, rush healer. isnt that basic logic?
3.44 to skip recap
Thanks people like you help
Sorry, I'm new. What is the skip recap stuff about? I can see it's helping people, but what does it do?
its mean thats how long the retell everything from the previous episode.. so if you dont wanna re-watch skip to (insert time here)
in the next season of bleach the builders of the soul society go on strike for constantly having to rebuild the society again and again and again
But aren't the buildings made of Reishi so does anyone actually build them even? I mean its established thats what their made of....
Damn you just killed the mood
Who would've ever thought that Komamura and Soi Fon would've put on such an epic battle? I can't believe it, but that fight is in my top 5 all-time bleach fights, right up there with Ichigo vs. Kenpachi.
me too! at first i wasnt looking forward to their battle but who woulda guessed it turned out so cool!
im so behind...it makes me wanna cry.....:'(

Why didn't Old Man Yama just kill the woman? =_=
am i the olny 1 who loved the byakuya vs byakuya battle..
No why would you be he is tied with the third or scong strongest captains he rocks
this is actually pretty good for a filler
Best filler arc EVAR
kind of takes the effect away when you see the same bankais go off over and over and over and...
2 questions, 1) how many times can the Seireitei be destroyed in a year, and 2) how much damage can they suffer in 24 hours?
shadow clone jutsu! haha

You people are ridiculous. It is filler because this never happened. Ever. When Ichigo passed out after defeating Aizen he awoke devoid of any power. There was no year where he would retain this diminishing power.
if his powers are gone show is over..... ; (
This is not a filler. Urahara said there are different stages to losing ones power. Ichigo passed the 1st stage after his battle with Aizen. He hasn't gotten to the final stage yet. Urahara said Ichigo can reach the final stage anytime,
The animation looks awesome. Much better than usual.
Komamaru: I cleave the Earth! | Soi:You...Jerk! | Koma: We still doing this? | Soi: I think we have to. | Koma: Why? What do you fight for?! | Soi: Duty! | Koma: And? | Soi: The Sexy Back on a Black Pussy! | Koma:...Right on...(bro fist)
i love soi
It really makes you wonder how much money is spent in order to fix SS after battles like this go down. I mean it must be a pain in the @ss. XD
Soi Fon's Bankai was shown before this though o.o
Yes many times why you ask
Even if he tried Ukitake and Kyoraku will still protect her. The best bet is to take them out at once
Recap ends at 3:47
