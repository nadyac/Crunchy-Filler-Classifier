Wow the 1st really was a badass and makes me think about Jiraiya, the way he acts and laughs.
Some of us, like me, dont know its a spoiler yet. But I know how you feel. Most of the madara stuff was already spoiled for me, so when i saw him in one of the openings i was like REALLY? I guess they think anime watchers dont read manga.

One of the best episodes of the series. The Hokages make orochi and sasuke look like genin, and they're not even at full strength. Things are about to get crazy.


The look on Lord First's face when he learns that Tsunade is the Fifth hokage was just priceless.
Four Hokage Comedy Tour anyone?
We are in agreement with this motion.
That would be awesome. First, will they go and deal with Madara and end this war?
yea xD imagine lord 1st arriving on the battle feild with a keg of rum no no no he summon jutsu uppers a keg of rum n asks what i miss blatantly the looks he would get the slap chops 2nd would give n the waaaah he'd get
get me some tickets for that.
shut up and take my money
The first Hokage is so cool
Totally a badass!
wow the 1st Hokage Hashirama is sooo OP!!
Nobody else wondering about how yamato is doing?
We just found out in the manga soo what maybe next year you guys can see it in the Anime?

He's not dead right now, he'll probably be rescued when the war ends.
you mean Tenzo?
he's still stuck in the cave thinking "where the hell is everyone?"
I did not know that Naruto had Hashirama's sense of humor.

I love Hashi. <3

He's a senju and a uzumaki, his father = senju, mother = uzumaki

want to kno, but people put spoiler tags on it and think its ok. Also I never read the comments before the episode, but today I did, cuz the video wouldn't load. So don't think there is only one reason someone would read before watching.
still in the end, watch the episode first then read the comments
@deathbynapalm - No... That's EXACTLY what the spoiler tag is for. Spoilers. Actual spoilers, from beyond this episode. Don't click on spoiler tags if you don't want to have the show...spoiled. You're at fault if you ignore that.

Why would this be any different than EVERY OTHER VIDEO HOSTING WEBSITE ON THE ENTIRE INTERNET? You comment on the video in the comments... herp a f***ing derp if you read comments before watching the video they're posted under.
4 HOKAGE MADNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!

Been waiting for this Episode ALL WEEK. <3

yea that sound funny ... but what madara would do when he found out about first should be interesting :]

I think it's beastly if when people ask who you are, that you can just say "Read my cloak bitch". I'm that n**** you dreamed of being!
ROFL "Read my clock bitch." *dies*

Flavor Flav LOL
Technically the person who asked who Minato was was a person that he (Minato) dreamed of being at one point though.
Hashirama is a BEAST!!!! I wonder how far the lineage is from the Sage of the Six Paths & Hashirama & Madara?
All your answers will be answered in due time. There's a lot of nice and juicy info coming in the near future and distant future.
I can't friggin' wait, Loomy! =D
By the time the anime watchers get to were we(manga readers) are probably gonna be like on the 3rd series of naruto
I love how they gave the Hokages flawed personalities. Every person in history has flaws and definitely wasn't perfect. It's over time that we forget those flaws and just remember their greatness.

Shows that even the best of Us have Our personality flaws.
Looking at MOST politicians, I'd say none are really heroes... Most "true" heroes you don't even know their names. Except in tv shows. Now comparing heroes and villians, yeah they are people too! The Uchiha fight out of LOVE!!!
@Darkprinc979 i prefers obama then George bush any time
@Fatboi998 Hitler was an amazing politician, leader, and had great economic policy. He just had some messed up human rights views.
Hashirama: TOBIRAMA! DATS RACIST!
just laughed so long my neighbor came to see if i was ok. at the end it was like a wheezing cough lmao

1st Hokage's all like, "Just chill bro. Chill."
This made me die... I was screaming "SLAP HM" though out this whole episode...
Hashi's a freakin' badass!
"Tobirama, lower your finger." He was going to take care of Sasuke with his finger. And Hashirama didn't even move at all. They're not even at their full strength O.o
they ALL "take care" of eachother with their fingers
If there wasn't a war happening,I can imagine Naruto teaching the Sexy Jutsu Technique to Hashirama when they meet!
Essentially the forbidden ones
Bahahah, that would be too hilarious... XD

how far ahead is the manga?
^It's getting pretty close to the end

Lmao First Hokage got me weak
The hokages are so funny >.< ... and scary O.O, dat chakra
xD
Totally awesome though! XD
Madara died old, but was revived as he was during his prime. So why didn't the same happen to Hiruzen? Was Madara's reanimation different?
Yeah, Kabuto states outright he used a different reanimation for Madara to revive him close to his prime.

The body is what has wrinkles and gray hair, not the chakra or soul.Edo Tensei doesn't use the person's body or corpse, it brings back their soul/chakra and puts it inside a LIVING sacrifice/vessel. Kabuto showed us this example.
So why was Nagato still crippled even after being reanimated??
