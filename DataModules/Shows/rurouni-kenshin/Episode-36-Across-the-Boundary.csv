I couldn't stop staring at his head .. it's like he was born to stop traffic ..
He must be one of the Coneheads
His next gig must have been as Kamen Rider Fourze. It would explain why they designed his helmet with such a head.
I don't remember that technique Kenshin just showed. It is a decapitation move obviously, but damn even with a sakabatou the results aren't pretty!
but if he used the blunt side, then the sharp side was facing him so how did he push on the far end of the sword with his left hand?
I always thought that both sides of the sword were blunt... that's why it's seen as a harmless sword (against living things anyway)
no it isn't blunt on the back side but he doesnt sharpen it either.
So that's why NBA players blow out there knees all the time.
I'm looking forward to Sojiro x Kenshin
Sengaku, you're so blunt, Sengaku get to the point already, all puns intended. lol
For those of you who don't know what happens when your entire face gets burned, Shishio shouldn't have a nose left at all.
Shhh!
Says the PyroSamurai....
gaaaah Kenshin is amazing
