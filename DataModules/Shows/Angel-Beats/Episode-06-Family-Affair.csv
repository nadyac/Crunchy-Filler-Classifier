It's amazing how much this show can make you laugh and then make you cry.
I cry so much from laughing, thanks to this show.
"I'll be back!"
i can't believe he actually said that in english
He says everything in english
Angel seems so innocent.. Why are they trying to hurt her? Well its not really becaue of her.
I hate it when everyone makes the Angel look like a bad guy.
sorry i accidentally clicked the thumbs down.. sorry my hand jerked.....
I love this opening theme!
agree
Its even better when you've already seen the series. You understand the meaning better
Someone probably already done this but... @3:34 I'll take this chip... AND EAT IT!
I was thinking of the same Death Note reference!
Wait so let me get this straight... Megumi Ogata played an androgynous boy with Daddy issues and a God Complex... the only think missing was the mech powered by his mother's soul,
So we've got a girl referred to as an angel, a guy who thinks he's Christ, and another guy with a god complex. I like where this is going.
Hinata is dumb Otonashi is smart TK is Werid Angel is cute :/ What the hell am i saying ;^;
lol
they need to continue this anime. its so funny

Thats a really mest up system is she going to be alone forever
It is a really well done series so far, I can't believe I never heard of it until now.
Same here.
this anime is so underrated.
At first it was funny how they all jumped out the window. But then GAWD THE FEELS
Poor Naoi and Angel! I almost cried.... :'(
Interesting. Death is not simply in the moment in which you're stripped of the breath of life, but when you lose all that you once had to live for. To live dead, this is questionably the worst fate in which a person can find themselves.
lol TK "ill be back" in that voice, too much.
oh my. that was beautiful. sad, but beautiful. Why am i just now watching this??
