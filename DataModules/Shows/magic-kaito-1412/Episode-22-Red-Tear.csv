Glad to see the great Kaito again this week. Every episode. He never disappoints to entertain the audience.
Of course, He brings us marvelous illusions that make our viewing devices sparkle at night!
This show really doesn't get the views it deserves.
I was about to chew you out xD It's 2:18 AM here and I read that wrong.... Tis what I get when I binge on an amazing anime such as this one! And with this, I'll see you next Illusion >:D
I read that wrong too for some reason lol.
Fortunately, it makes up for that in viewers on actual Japanese TV, where it airs in a genuine timeslot for its own sake and not just as an ad for the disc sales the way late-night otaku shows do!
I can't see views but the votes are up to 130 which is a lot higher than before so it's catching on I think.
WHEN I BECOME RICH ILL PAY YOU A MILLION DOLLARS TO DO ANOTHER SEASON!
i hope that's soon...
Dude, i'll help you with that! Lets start a petition for more Magic Kaito
There's not enough source material. Getting 2 cours is already a blessing that required Kid PoVs of Conan plots. Maybe in another 10 years Gosho will write enough Magic Kaito on the side to get another cour.
There's still a couple of stories from the first volume of Kaito, plus they could probably make a couple of anime only stories and use more Conan plots.
My happiness for this episode airing is great.
That profile pic ... kawaii man

Thanks!
Yahoo, I love this show!
Kept refreshing for the upload. Love this series!
I never get tired of these!
First to comment? First time seeing the release later than usual, glad crunchyroll was transparent and updated the status concerning prod issues
u know i really think that the dad is the black kaito kid
Got so many feels this episode ;P

why is the ruby blue, rubies are sopose to be red. if its blue it must be a sapphre. Rubys CANNOT be blue
i love 2:11 were kaito just stands in front of 100 cops or so


The day when Kaito Kid doesn't end the episode with See you next illusion, is the day I am terrified that the anime might be ending.
Why is the jewel blue when they say its a Ruby and specifically called the RED tear?
