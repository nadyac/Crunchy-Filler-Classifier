wordlessly changing scenes expressive but pay attention first made no sense but rewatch cleared up story getting deeper but va hit miss took away enjoyment im certain series aimed an acquired taste feel like show gives so much feel time slow down; maybe because reminds more graphic novel then anime didnt notice these wordless scenes
