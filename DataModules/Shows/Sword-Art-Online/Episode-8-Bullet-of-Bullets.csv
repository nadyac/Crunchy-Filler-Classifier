what if someone else was in the water or someone saw you
I wonder, how would Asuna feel about seeing Kirito go on a naked swim on the BoB broadcast?
get back! its the bullet of bullets! Battle of bullets eat your heart out, its the bullet to end all bullets! ...oh wait... no... They just need to fire their crappy translator... and all the time they spent doing all those billboards...

"Please cheer for me" Kirito's getting real used to looking like a girl
I lmao, I wasn't expecting Kirito to do that
No! For real! I laughed out loud! My neighbors probably heard me laughing. It was too unexpected!
When I saw that part...k..kk...kisaeee!!! (unkown-made-up-Japanese-like language for 'the hell?!'
It was too precditable for this.
guys who have a problem with Kirito acting that way are really insecure with their masculinity, damn, grow up
death gun-chan please keep praying for your victim for an entire week so we have time to stop you <3
What if Death gun turns around and tries to shoot Kirito and Asada Shinon and it doesn't work because Pale Rider shoots Death Gun >:D but, i am too impatient to wait 1 week for each episode
lol i like reading everyone's guesses. Kinda fun to hear what others think. Though they're so off lol

If they don't censor it, gender revealed. If they do censor, a lot of people were very curious as to why "her" chest was uncensored.
If the satellite can't see him, I'm guessing the cameras can't either.
Haha, just imagine what Asuna is thinking about right now.
First, he said -san, then -neesan, I wonder what the next one would have been.
well, it's other people's fault for thinking he's a girl lol
Did Sinon's shorts get smaller or did her ass get bigger?
@mrchopin: Since the system makes mistakes, then it can't be a very sophisticated scanner, so it would only pick up "surface thoughts". So, whatever gender a player believed they truly are would most likely be their avatar's gender.
Its an unconscious reaction to Kirito. Girls get within 100 meters and turn a few times more hotter...

no wonder all the guys think hes a girl -_-
Kirito gets even more action looking like a girl than he did when he was a guy, an thats saying somthin
He isn't a girl he just looks like one. His avatar is male despite the more *Cough* deceiving appearance.
First holding Sinon by the waist and now pinning her down. Looks like Kirito-kun is on a role. I wonder whats next.
@taichi556 because its only 24 episodes

Isn't this 25 episodes? I'm pretty sure this was confirmed to be 2-cour already.

@HazLightNin He should perform the Bronco Buster on her.
"I'd like to get shot!" or "I'd like to be sliced up" So many good choices!
Kirito, dropping panties of both sexes since 2022
20:35.... I seriously don't think that's a male avatar
Correct because the headset reads the brain waves during character creation to determine your gender so you don't have that option. It really is the way to tell if someone is truly a female on the internet

@SinCityIceman,@killmehtwice 1.calm down 2.WE all Know his a male 3.We all playing around saying his a female
it was his knee that made it look like he had boobs
The reason he end up with the avatar was explained by the guys Kirito 1st met when he enter GGO. This is a reward for long time running account. Funny how a no body guy would know the specific series # of the avatar while other players dont
So if the public can view these games (including people from other games through MMO Stream), then everyone just got a good look at Kirito's little skinny dipping adventure. And Sinon warned him about showing his sword before fighting...
There isn't always a camera on them at all times, they specifically choose the camera with the most potential for action going on to show.
LOL!!! I wonder if it still works after he gets it wet like that.
@dfyfe Kirito's mermaid adventure is plenty of action if you ask me.
Meh if the spy camera didn't pick him up then I doubt that people were actually able to him while he was underwater.

I say it's Waldo, there's a reason he's always hiding out in crowds... nobody suspects the nerd in striped clothes.
@^ lol
This is a guess, but it has to be Sterbert. "Pale Rider" makes no sense since ALO didn't have steads and "Gun X" would be too obvious. Unless its a hacked character that won't even show up on the name lists of course... or is "dead"
...I speak German and because this is Japanese I completely lapsed and didn't even connect the two. I feel ashamed.
@Greenoak, you know, other than Pale Rider is a common name for Death as in the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. All 3 have names indicating death, lol.

^...Hmm.
Hey, whatever works right? Kirito is just taking advantage of the perks.
What wildboardp says it true, It was a divergence from the LN, As well as well as Kirito calling Sinon Sinon-neesan. But Hilarious nonetheless. & LN wise the guy that wanted to buy Kirito's avatar & Sinon (@ The dressing room) & Spiegel
The anime for the non LN readers. My self i'm loving all the anime watcher speculation.
In japanese, what translates to king doesn't define gender.
HAREM TYCOON
Harem Shogun!
I would so play Harem Tycoon if Microsoft Studios would get going on it already.
the lols
"Please cheer for me!" ;D I think Kirito's getting a little too comfortable with this being a girl thing.
I know right
HE has become one of those i want free stuff cause im pretending to be a girl.
I used to know a kid who admitted he picked female avatars so he would get more free stuff in WOW. I am not making this up.

Also, the sign of the cross is used for last rites in Catholicism. Which is what Death Gun was basically doing.
Still...kind of weird that a Christian symbol is showing up here. Christianity is nearly non-existent in Japan (only 1% of the pop identify as Christian) so they might be doing it for style, but do the Japanese fans even know what it means?
Trigun moment there?
The Japanese demonize Catholicism in many anime, the symbology is rife. Its not always bad, sometimes the Catholics are doing good deeds but mostly its murder, mayhem or of coarse the end of the world like in evangelion.
Well, isn't GGO an american game? :| Okay, I'll shut up now.
The anime ends here? Is that legal?
So many questions left unanswered.
But it's not over... is it?
@Henzapper yup and saw Kirito's girly body lol
Unfortunately the cliffhanger is legal, But with the BOB started. Things rev up from here. So tune in again next week & don't be late. (watch @ work (lunch of course) if you have to ( i do))
Haha kirito chan!

@PonPeriPon Go fishing in the hentai gallery. I'm pretty sure you'll find one there.
Trap + Troll = Kirito-kun
Actually Trap + Troll = Kirito-chan
Actually Trap + Troll = Kiriko-chan
Kiroto always has the audience at heart - he just combined advanced stealth tactics with fanservice
