Awww....you guys, what happened to "We're all your friends and we're gonna reforge your sword so the Vatican jerks don't kick your ass and then help you kill Amaimon"? Stop being mean to Rinnnnn...
I know right
If you think the anime is lacking I'd suggest reading the manga, it's a lot better and you get more backstory.
Shugo Chara was addicting too!
I was just wondering about that. I understand why they would be afraid, but surely he should have gained their trust by now.
Bad writing happened
why is this so good when im trying to sleep?!
I know i only watch at night for somereaosn
dropping all the blame of what a father did before he was born is so one sided.

screw his behemoth
You don't F*ck with Amaimon's Behemoth, SHIT GETS REAL THEN!!!
agreed O.O
lol
It was kinda cute i have to say
We all know that when opra music is involved someone is either kicking some major ass right now or some major ass kicker has awaken!
opra?...Oprah! Everyone gets some free Blue Flame!...You get a blue flame, and YOU get a blue flame, and YOU get a blue flame....and You get your arm sliced off with a demon sword! Today's guest is the King of Earth!
Man I kinda liked Amainmon
No, not just opera music. Also the awesome, creepy keyboard music that sounds like an organ.
I can't get enough of that ending song.
Does anyone else turn the volume up when he gos demon
What are you talking about my volumes is always on MAX
mine is max as well
I broke the volume control on my headset so I can NEVER turn it down!
i said i was going to sleep after 6 episodes ago oops
baka did you really think that would happen.
Aho* FTFY
SHIT JUST GOT REAL.
not a fan of this ending song...as much as the first one >_<
the current paladin is weak. -_-
well compared to a demon king yes he's weak
@ 21:54... lawlz....rin turned into edward cullen....ya know with all the damn sparkles
yeah he did XD
THESE MOTHER FUCKING ADS
saketo has a point: Jesus is in a barn, Rin is a cave, Jesus walks on water, Rin walk on air, Jesus reborn after 3 days, Rin is reborn after 1 episode, Jesus is crucify on the cross, Rin is frozen in a crystal midair.
man these ads are pissing me off. but its a small price to pay to watch such an awesome show

membership buddy
dude dont use ad block your taking money from the people who made this or were in this
i have this feeling yukio sooner or later is going to find out he inherited satan's power as well, iand hes going to go beserk. just a feeling
Poor rin..): Why must they be so mean T.T
He reminds me of naruto when the 9 tails takes over.

@ryan It's pretty immature to call a show shitty just because it's mainstream. If shows like Naruto had never become mainstream, how many people on this site would never have discovered anime?
agreed @Aethnen
@01001101001, he reminds me more of Ed from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood on those last couple episodes... Rofl people using friggin tanks and couldn't take this one guy down and then he walks in and kills him with his fists.
@Aethnen cant agree more. im here cause of naruto too
i love the aniplex sound thumbs up if u agree
He reminds me of Natsu so much, even more so when he says he's 'fired up' lol
Fun fact. Amaimon has Natsu's voice actor.
Gentle stroll through the comment section.... Lah lah lah lah- what. o_o
Its not like I came to help you...Baka
Watashi wa anata yori mo Nihon no yori yoi hanasu koto ga dekiru
Amaimon reminds me of Chowder's best friend. We all remember that show now don't we? xD
