Did he really just have an epiphany after staring at Sinon's butt?
I was like: "good gracious, ass is bodacious"
INB4 Figma of Sinon's severed ass.
my only thought is "dat ass" and If Asuna catches any of this, Kirito may be be running from more than just bullets.
For an anime character, Sinon does have a nice booty just saying.
@gsbabygirl No, he may only be running from bullets, as Asuna might come after him with a pistol
Maybe it was that floating camera showing us all those ass shots o_0
And then the camera goes down so you can see it at an angle. Bravo.
well did you think SAO stood for Sword Art Online? no it stands for Sweet Ass Online
lmfao
The camera operator was hoping for some yuri action, but when the two looked up at it, the camera operator moved the camera somewhere else. LOL
Lol was that butt zoom in really necessary? It was just like.... THERE it IS! Or right I'm watching anime. Givin them selves a bad name by purposely doing that lol i dunno just seems cliche everytime i see that in anime.
In this episode of Sinon's Ass Online - the plot thickens
The plot in this show seems to get plumper with every episode. I
Well it is called SAO after all. As you can tell there are no swords, but there is art in Sinon's Ass Online. The graphics are well done.
hay we are forgetting about the most impotent part of the episode the lizard that grew a second tale just before the lizard ass shot. come on people that is the most impotent part of the hole episode. but rely this did nothing for the story
Or is it something else thats thickening?
what are you getting at cruncheh-san?

Actually, I think one of the bad guys (Must be the one administering the shot, because Sterben is not the same avatar as his) is probably Sinon's only friend. Seriously, you do not mess with the harem. You just don't.


the first real booty man ive seen in an anime lol, they usually check out the breasts
Also, I'm sure if you ever spectated any game, you would have noticed that this follows the pattern of delayed broadcast present in most - if not all - online tournament games.
whos watching the watchers.?
RORSACH!!!!!!!!!!!
@dakillamilla Maybe because her boy toy is the other Death Gun..? Just a theory. You don't mess with the harem.
Well, only thing, is with Sinon.. what breasts.. LOL
"Sinon, you've got something on your ass." "What?" "My eyes."
Many things in that case
well my eyes where on dat ass for a long time. I actually had to pause the video
GOLD
i came looking for booty.
A Boondocks reference love it!

Does anybody around here even has the capacity to read the LN?...
But... But.. We wanna watch the anime, tho.
The LN is easily found in english with a online search. The GGO arc is "Sword Art Online light novel volumes 5 and 6". I've read them and enjoy seeing it as an anime and reading all the theorys. LN shouldnt be used for spoilers though.
True that^^^ If we wanted to we could unleash a whole mess of spoilers up to the current LN chapters. But most of us know how it is when we don't read the original work & get massive spoilers in the comments.
I've read the LN.. but wont tell... the nurse very well could be... or not, I think she just wants to be part of the Kirito harem....
Kirito sneaking a peek
@cuttingwaters it sure does Anime Logic #14 less clothes equals more power

Just in case somebodies wondering what "sterben" means: It's the german word for dying / to die
But wouldn't the Japanese government peoplez see that and think, "Hmm, he seems suspicious, maybe we should put him on our suspects list"?
@firedestroyer If they did that they would have to suspect anyone who has made an avatar with a name signifying death in a game that is about killing people with guns.
What if Asuna found out about Sinon and Kirito on each other like that LOL
If that happened I don't think they would have to worry about Death Gun anymore
It'll probably be a small joke or two. But Asuna would believe Kirito. No worries. They are definitely going to stick it out. If they don't, I wouldn't keep watching!
Ahh, live camera feed. Gotta love it.
Lmao at 'is there someone you don't want seeing this?' You hit the nail hard on the head Sinon, Kirito-kun better change his game if he wants to avoid a 'close call'
It may be too late..
"SAO would like to apologise for the amount of dialogue in this episode. In the meantime please enjoy these completely unnecessary close-ups of Sinon's buttocks."
hahah && Holy_Sock strikes again! ^^
it got me interested why not
Pause at 6:45, 8:04, 09:05, 19:02 and 20:41 for all Sinon ass moments.I was in doubt but its clear now Reki Kawahara is an ass man.
Technically it could (also) be A-1 staff in charge of making SAO.
dude you missed 5:08 the best part!
I'm disappointing by this surge of blatant sexism in this show xD
i must say sir this comment was very useful. You have my regards

I don't think Asuna trusts Kirito's nurse
cant blame her i dont trust that nurse either
Better hope Asuna doesn't see that recording, Kirito.
Nothing was done, only Kirito trying to comfort Sinon. I'm sure Asuna would at least allow Kirito's explanation and would believe him.

WHY WHY MY EYES
...i just head to click and read it...fully knowing it was a spoiler x.x
Why can't I unsee this! CR need spoiler levels eg. After episode spoiler and Light novel spoiler. AAAAAAAAARGH I hate you seanxwarp!

Still think Death-Gun is the Pizza delivery guy.

"It'd been over two years, but your pizza is finally here. Careful though, it has so many carbs that it might be heart stopping"
So. . . How about I simply help spoil something without saying the spoiler. Look up the german translation for Sterben.
I love how he was all, "There is a high likelihood that there is a killer in your room right now, looking over you. He could kill you RIGHT. NOW." Oh don't worry about it calm down
That kid with the grey hair is getting a pretty raw deal, watching his crush snuggled up to another on a live broadcast.
imo that kid is deathgun at lest the one in the game
Kirito: *Screenshot*
