Sad sad story...I bet that man is full of regret...



It wasn't revenge he was after. It was Ultimate Strength. He didn't care about those dudes at all.

Everyone claimed to quit watching after last episode but these fillers are the best part of the anime for me.
I think fillers will be good bookends for what was a really intense, 30+ episode arc.
idc about the fillers this music makes it worth watching <3
Man I was kinda hoping there'd be a new opening theme.
