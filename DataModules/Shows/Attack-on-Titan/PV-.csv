When i saw this i got so excited because i thought it was season 2, then i looked and it was only season 1:( , still glad it's back though
Season 2 is in pre-production and most likely will not be out before 2016
no its changed, might come out at the end of december
It's out now! WOOOOO!
it said it come out in 2015 in there website www.shingeki
c'mon crunchyroll, please put out the OVA's, the fan subs arent that great and you always give the best subs.
I can't even explain why, but hearing the 3DMG work is really soothing to the ear
They can put this here but not the OVAs? Well whatever, this is freaking amazing anyway
"Hey let's release a PV for Attack on Titan and get everyone hyped up for the second season! Little will they know that it's the PV for the first season." You guys got my hopes up
Aw I was hoping to re-watch AoT during my spree of re-watching animes but only the first half is available ;-;
YO WHERE IS THIS SONG IN THE SERIES? IT AIN'T ON THE SOUNDTRACK, GOD DAMN.
This is by far, to me, the best anime I've seen in a LONG TIME. It runs right up there with cowboy bebop.
