The crow population is now out of control!
Haha xD.
lol
I would totally fondle Tayuya's clone if i was kabuto XD is that bad ?
This comment is just too much for me to take! XD
@SilentNinjaChris No it's not. I would too. XD
LOL, Itachi's like: Kabuto, it's okay to respect and admire someone, but this is just plain creepy...
I guess we're all under izanami
so when we have that moment of deja-vu we are actually under izanami
or it means theres a glitch in the matrix
Or maybe Suzumiya Haruhi is pissed off with something.
Tailed Beast Counting Song = New way to show less content.
Good episode. I love Itachi.
so why does the 7 tails look different? anyone? like a big green rolly-poley.
Cuz it's a caterpillar/larva which grows into that flying insect form later.
i like this song!
I like it ^_^
wow i swear ive seen this episode more than once?
Flashbacks to Flashbacks of having Flashbacks about Flashbacks........
The amount of flashbacks is just too damn high!
Aren't the flashbacks just a bunch of Izanami loops?
flashbacks with new content that expand and explain unanswered questions and backstories are great, it's the endless flashbacks to old episodes and things that already happened that are annoying as hell
You're under the Izanami. 0_0
SECRET WRITER ART: FLASHBACK-A-NO JUTSU
yep the manga gets really good after this next flash back plus we get to see some new mangekyo eyes should be net
Hey, they could have pulled a The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya with an "Endless Eight" stunt & play the episode over & over 8 times with only minor differences for each episode. Then the staff would have had 2 more month manga buffer.
monster-man that would be a good idea,like twinxiest's idea let them do a bunch of whatever eps,then they wont have to show fillers/flashbacks, cuz repeating Sasuke trying to do Itachi's shuriken jutsu 1000 times is old. we've all seen it.
First Rule About the Manga Do Not Speak Of The Manga...Second Rule Do Not Talk About the Manga and Third Rule Do Spoil The Show LOL
itachi makes a great point though. it's one thing to admire and imitate someone, but to splice the genes from their dead corpse with yours? ewwww!
Itachi gives some great advice. Don't turn yourself into someone else.
That's why i find Naruto so inspirational. Great stories to be told and lessons to be learnt.
When "Naturo Shippuden Kai" gets out it will be awesome indeed.
Like Dragonball Kai is good ? i really prefer the whole normal Dragonball Z.
Or Do Not turn yourself someone else's snake lol
Oh man these episodes w/ Itachi and Sasuke kick ass, I really like Itachi's character, how he fights is freakin awesome he is like 100 moves ahead of any opponent!!!!
that jutsu ... would make u lose ur mind and lay on the ground whining and craying with ur thumb in ur mouth ...
What's a Groundhound?
It's like a groundhog, but made of fail.
Probably make an excellent target. = )
maybe a groundhog greyhound mixture?
Haha... GroundHound..
I don't mind the new backstory stuff, but regular flashbacks are so annoying. Especially ones we've seen like 20 times already.
That was necessary to get the point across of what the Izanami is.
No it wasn't.I think they're talkin about Sasuke trying to imitate Itachi's shuriken jutsu.That has been shown WAY WAY too many times.In fact all Sasuke flashbacks have been shown 10000 times. his family killed,Itachi ignoring him all of it
[This comment has been removed]
there's only so many times you can watch itachi killing his entire family. i mean, come on, we get it already!
Soon they will use "The yinchuriki song" in a loop like izanami in all episodes.
They are already doing it.
its jinchuriki
there needs to stop being flash backs from episodes that only aired a week ago...wtf
It annoys me to see people call episodes like this "filler" episodes. Its clearly not and its all apart of the current story, the plot and the build up. Naruto wouldn't be as popular as it is today if people didn't like what they did.
Someone called this episode a filler episode? I didn't see anyone say that. It was the goddamn counting song that was there to fill up time.
you guys are stupid, izanami is a sweet jutsu deserving a little back story. i agree on the song being a gyp.
umm,, a filler is called a filler because it was never a shown in the manga. The next episode is therefore a filler episode regardless of it's (meaning the jutsu's) worthiness for a back story.
haha it'd prob be more popular, cuz more people wouldn't of said "fuck this" and stopped watching. twinxiest you are right twice now. good for you
I really don''t understand the point of having flashbacks from 2 episodes ago.
Wow, Izanami is fearsome when you actually get to see it instead of reading about it. Sucks for Kabuto, shouldn't have messed with Itachi I guess.
I think this is the third time I've heard the Jinjuriki song playing. Am I under Izanami too?
23 min show. 5 mins is opening, last 3 is ending. 13 mins of talking and flash backs with nothing going on and 2 mins of new info. seems like this is how they make episodes now
Izanami = ULTIMATE FLASH BACK LOOP JUTSU Once activated you will be under the impression the show is progressing only to find out the next flash back loop is beginning. Like 99.9999% sure that is what the episode was trying to tell us

I wonder when these writers will realize there is enough content in the naruto universe to make good fillers. Show us history of the sage of six paths, show us 1st and second ninja war, show us any history and it will be good filler!
I guess the tailed beast song was Izanami affecting us too
