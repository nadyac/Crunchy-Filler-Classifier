the shopkeeper is the Batman of this show x) always has some fancy gadget to every thing

I miss ashido...remember him? the badass soul reaper who used the hollow mask like a shield??

I wonder if we will ever see Urahara fight with full strength. a.k.a his Bankai. And I also wonder why they didn't think of making a body for Kon. I know he's there to replace Ichigo's body, but at least for some occasion he has his own.
agreed, and why didn't nova and the others help I mean they did show them at the very beginning of the arc hanging out in the shop plus nova is perfect for reflecting attacks
who
Be honest, all of us knew of his badass status the minute we saw his hat.
The way everyone other than captains are taking on these Reigai makes me think the current captains suck. Old man Yamamoto needs to swallow his pride and let the exiled Vizard and other ex-captains take their rightful places back. :p

WTF? Is this english?
This is english, it is, however quite obviously corrupted by a hollow.
its ironic how many times he said think, when he obviously doesn't
GOOD MORNING!
is it just me or is Unohana secretly a bad ass?

ITS BACK! THAT THING THAT KILLED ULQUIORRA! D:<
YAAAAAAAY

Bee Chick and Diet Fatso! ROFLMAO!!!
It's just great to see the same types of people complain every week, but it's the same every week. Stop watching if you loathe it so much. The rest of us LOVE it. Get over yourselves.
Did anyone else notice how nonchalantly Kisuke blew everyone up...?
Oh cool I haven't seen ichigos full hollow form since ulquiorras fight like near episode 265
that was a quick battle against urahara!! lol & KON- GOOD MORNING! HAHA
Urahara is BOSS! ^^


I've always wanted to see more of Urahara's abilities so this was a GREAT episode for me! He's such a BA.
