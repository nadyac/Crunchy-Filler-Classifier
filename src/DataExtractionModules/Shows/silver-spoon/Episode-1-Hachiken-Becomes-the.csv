Let's observe a moment of silence for Pork Bowl who won't be the season 2 sadly. We will never forget you my friend.
But pork bowl was in this season, as bacon.
And a moment of silence for the ending song to Season 1.This one holds no candle!!
Kahaal gets me
me too.
Pork bowl T.T you was great.

Fight on Hachiken! She wants to tell you what happened it's just taking a while for her to open up. A few more pushes in the right direction (and maybe knocking him on his butt) will get you what you want.
@Tazoor you are right, it actually makes me nostalgic to go back to my country and help out in the farm. Unfortunately is not modern as the ones in Japan.
@Tazoori..yup, and after watching Non Non Biyori..I just had to go and visit my fathers "farm"..

OWARI!
I don't always buy porn magazines but when I do I make sure they are cow porn magazines.
They creep me out.... But i guess it's their thing..... :l
Rule 34 my friend
It's great to have Silver Spoon back in fine form, as always I was treated to a full range of emotions, and as always I was left hungry more than once. Really enjoy the new ED as well.
Opening is pretty good too!
holy nuts the OP!!!
Haha, I was really starting to wonder. What girl in her right mind boldly asks a guy to find her missing large black bra??? Hachiken's reaction was priceless. As per usual, this show does not disappoint.
But his actions are correct. When a girl ask you to help her find her black bra you do it!
Hachiken is so great as an audience surrogate. I know nothing about farming either, so if someone plays a practical joke on him, I'm right there, thinking what he thinks. I want to apologize for my behavior, Mikage-chan!
could have been a friend zone tactic or she just thinks his gay or something that if it was her bra bra
THAT was the sushi pitch
That ED song is fantastic.
I really like the animation style and the way it spins to change frames.
Go go Goose House!!!
He's asking why they hold a BBQ after every exam? I would be happy as hell if that happened every time.
I never got anything after exams, I kinda feel ripped-off.
As soon as I heard the BGM, I was like ''you're not gonna end the episode without telling us why she was crying right?'' But then the ED hit me like ''The End''....
Watching this episode and last season I realized they actually highly hinted at what was going on both last season and during this one. I don't know I didn't see it coming.
unfortunatly, I've been reading the manga...spoilers for the anime...if the anime follows the manga..you are so right..
There were lots of hints about joining the farms and arranged marriages and so on but then Hachi will be a salaryman! That huge (wage) packet can turn a mother-in-law's head, right?
Good to see the Holstein Club hasn't changed
[This comment has been removed]
I just love how creepy they are! :3
And one episode in, we're automatically reminded of just how amazing a writer Hiromu Arakawa is!
LOL at Holstein club and Hachiken saying 'It's the Cow Porn Magazine lmao. Cracked me up!
I am so glad this is back on! Never thought I'd be so happy about a Farming Anime.
Hilarious reference to Mitsuru Adachi's classic Touch, *the* classic manga and anime where the ace pitcher takes his childhood friend to Koshien, as promised. The cover of the manga she's reading even looks like one of the Touch volumes
haven't read touch, but it sounds just like Cross Game as well
Touch and Cross Game are by the same author/artist
I'm gonna have to remember that particular men's room interrogation technique.
Well that left me grinning from cheek to cheek!
Mikage be trolling and wow the ED for this new season is really good, talk about a catchy song.
for anyone who needs it 5V7NDHYF8FG, EJBMSSV4CN9
the ending theme is way too cute for me to handle. the colors and the song together is just perfect~
I am so oddly drawn to this anime.
I don't find it odd at all. Compare to most other titles I've watched; this anime has an excellent storyline and most important, excellent pacing.
