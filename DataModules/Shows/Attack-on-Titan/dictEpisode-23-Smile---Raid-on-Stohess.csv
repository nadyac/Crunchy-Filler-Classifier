ahh another cliffhanger but joke attack titan ready cant fool 23 weeks row hahahahaha next week all hell going down cant wait awesome very good episode yay armin orrrrr can not read comments till after watch episodecause works well laugh actually turned though probably blushing andor mikasas badass stance xd these cliffhangers definitely made putting off watching show so long worth couldnt done week week thing like guys did man nope twenty minutes suspension can tricked by attack titan armin right now most useful character series up current development armin female wonder odd itd eren both his best friends women mean only girls friends many would interpret extreme friendzoning its kinda funny anyone can call him useless mean without him eren would never tried save him got eaten never unlocked titan abiltys plus city would ashes without his planning ikr eren still go eaten which would who would cme up titan plan why armin favorite saddens such an under appreciated character but isnt under appreciated all wouldnt shown much no instead very important story just like came up plan take back wall even eren asked him what should do military police mean bitch brigade realize its spelled avantgarde not avantguarde right also just called bitch brigade pussy patrol cunt crusaders experimental innovative obviously need think before post #sarcasim amount one liners thread reminiscent 6th grade much am laughing shows mature sense humor omfg this comment removed this comment removed might either liked him highly respected him because his solid logic spared him twice think gear being checked during conversation realized her respectfeelings him said guts think respects him bit idk find her hot ok nothing actionrelated actually happens ep still feels like less than min obviously doing something very right aw maaaannnnnnn shits about hit fan within cushy wall sina damn aramin pick all up very first encounter annie dudes skittish but damn hes sharp didnt really even try hide her though mean first time female titan showed up like hmmthatlookslikethatleonheartchick plus one only ones who didnt go survey corps looks like female titan exactly figured but still dont know why what motive gaaaaahhhh figure 17 47 minutes per episode hour aired commercial breaks by comparison break blade series movies each closer 50 minutes each katanagatari also 50 minute episodes tenchi muyo war geminar those long episodes well left lot dialog out episode manga like flashback annie training her father dialog manga totally different cant really expect add every snippet dialogue thats manga theres too much theyd end up making less progress storyline per epsiode god annie super hot episode 2123 mikasa too this comment removed went google did an image search hunter hunter then attack titan clearly aot more badass google doesnt lie image searching an anime means nothing base an animes appeal off its artwork youre missing out lot each series good its own right not wish every episode 60 minutes wish every episode just 30min 24min whole thing4min actual episodes sigh just watch every weeks then youll your 60 minutes mean sword singular because only one blade attached 2053 other handle wielded solely mg use trouble waiting till late night watch aot along other anime dont think can make long knowing new episode up aahhhh longed hear opening past 604800 seconds 2146 big guy knows parkour xd yeah liked seeing him do made drop out moment second laugh honestly find hardly anything wrong series recent review talked about show mediocre comparison what could much better could honestly guess slow pace means plot character development maybe changed episode titles more often then some people will think moves faster feels slow because its so great want moar 30min not enough all honesty id prefer anime stay true original work possible numerous reasons foremost being could change something early but could huge impact later anime actually lot original content here anime manga annie much longer speech marlow marlow didnt get beat up annie didnt hysterical laughing but smug smile while sweating yes but lauging hot annies laugh something isayama came up combination bunch different emotions its not original content httpnolanekotumblrcompost61348614374hajim am only one who shocked by annies blushing her laugh cute not sure blushing but pretty shocked about laugh came out nowhere mmmmmh mikasa ponytail this comment removed think broke annie here cliffhangers tread lightly am one who knocks ring do since would caught otherwise good cliffhangers priceless lol right saw jean could tell what thinking by his expression whythefuckamidoingthisshit could his thoughts hahahahaah glad see survey corps hasnt gone wolves yet cant wait see farce holds up last episode made sound like end sc annie mmm armin dontworryyoubothlooklikecriminalsyoubothhavenastyeyes erin idonthavealonghorsefacelikehim lol way break tension speaking looks ive thinking ever since first saw his teenage design erens eyes look almost exactly like links loztp wild feral good match his titan form think eren owes jean lunch something annie ok ok annie episode definitely crescendo lol two good think smoothkyojin works better here lyrically ill people call your people well get settled lool knew knew so hard this comment removed no one knows but those who read manga really should spoiler manga monthly expect long wait season maybe year more many anime will basically over by 2526th episode thought same thing shes only blond haired girl different nose odd joined military police despite her being clever clever armin its storytelling style wherein theyd skip certain part meeting where armin laid down his hunch survey corps decided act so ep assumes everyone knows armins plan thats why annie called armins bet episode 17 one which female titan appears first time kick ass episodes following encounter armin also speaks other clues last technically first clue caught third episode theyll most likely explain next week give little bit all will revealed well common id ego alter ego trio other examples include kirk spock mccoy harry hermione ron think even hanji levi erwin may make up another one well general recurring aot armin all respect armin erin mikasa make think triforce armin holds triforce wisdom erin holds tryforce courage mikasa triforce poweryeah am nerd this comment removed hmm except id say eren triforce power since know titan stuff hes not really brave hes more genocidal about titans bpfht3va4fk gosh annie psycho lol annie xd
