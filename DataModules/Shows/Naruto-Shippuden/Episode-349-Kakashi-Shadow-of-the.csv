I really think he just has some really big canines. We already know he can smell blood.
He cant be shaggy... that would imply he shaved sometimes.. lol.
If Kakashi took off his mask, no one would know who he was.
Under his mask is just another mask
He's truly dashing~
My hatred of Danzo is even greater than before...
Danzo messing things up? It's more like Danzo represents the "conservative" side of the Konoha that relies on force to keep their land secure. He's more of an "ends justifies the means" guy.
I agree with most of the comments about Danzo, but I feel he's owed an ounce of perspective. He was the Sandaime's appointed advisor along with the other 2 for decades. Minato disbanded Root not the 3rd., who turned a convenient blind eye.

Man i could not agree with you more SabakuNoAkatsuki. i hate Danzo so much more than before!
Danzo's way of solving problems and keeping Konoha safe caused so many problems... He caused Itachi to kill the Uchihas and ended up making Sasuke go rogue. Danzo ended up making Kabuto kill his "mother" Now he messed up Nagato, who else?
"That would definitely leave a hole in your heart" Possibly the worst choice of words one could have picked for this situation.
Why didn't Minato seem as sad as Kakashi,I know he didn't see them die, but he still was their teacher. He didn't seem really affected by their deaths

It's obviously been at least a while since Rin's death, and a good while since Obito's. Presumably Minato is a healthy person who knows how to grieve and then move on.
The dialogue actually said, "...leave a mark/scar/wound on your heart", hole here was just the translators being a bit cheeky.
wait... what? hole in heart? ...Oh... OH...! OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everytime i see this ending i think "poor obito" :'(
Maybe it possibly that's why we still don't know about Madara plans. Thank you, SpiritWolf15 we will learn that Madara's background.
Mr. SpiritWolf15. What Madara wants is to FORCE peace upon the masses. Forced Peace is not peace. some people (like myself) revel in chaos and to take that away is wrong. either way you look at it, its wrong.
This show makes me love and feel bad about the Villains they all have rich back stories full of twists and turns that make them seem human again.... except Danzo he's just an ass
@Time2Warp you should see Gintama then. Every villain will make you cry.
@Neograv If you wanted chaos then Madara could just alter the Genjutsu on you specifically so that you perceive chaos in the world. The whole point of the Infinite Tsukuyomi is that it can create anyone's perfect world
Kakashi + Anbu gear + sharingan = badass
naruto looks just like his dad and acts like his mom
Did you really say Kushina's eyes? REALLY?!
I'm watching this episode because their showing minato and kushina, they need more screen time seriously
@jotruong10 maybe its because they are dead they dont have much screen time...
Naruto looks just like Kushina, he only has his colouring in common with Minato.
@SoJellyBro 1)No, I'm not jelly, bruh. 2)Yes, if you actually noticed or even saw Minato's eyes. It's obvious it's a little upward. No, a lot upward and much more smaller.
Damnnn... Kakashi was like 10 years old, and already stared to have post traumatic stress. Life of the Shinobi Struggle.
Picking up that book was a symptom of the possible PTS.
why wear that mask when no ones around! WTF
i hope that they would reveal his face in this arc lolol
This arc is actually to re-instill the hatred everyone has for Danzo**
Ending was so badass.

Funny how Orochimaru said the 3rd would puppet the 4th when danzo was gonna try that with him..he could never contain orochimaru ppeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I haven't heard Orochimaru's voice actor for so long. It sounded unusually more scratchy....not exactly as I remember it.
i think Orochimaru is the reason Danzo has all them dang sharingans. My mistake. 'Had'. lol
due to orochimaru's help he only had the first hokage's cells and not the sharingans dont u think if orochimaru had a sharingan he would keep it for himself that give it to danzo
Danzo is trash, but exciting trash. Good for character/plot development kind of trash
Can Danzo just... idk dissapear from history? hes fucked up so much shit >.<
@ superlevelhelper: wow...what'd you get so wrong in chemistry? It's not like calculus where if you misunderstand a piece of an equation you get everything wrong by default.
This argument neatly illustrates why I don't think "right" and "wrong" are really very useful concepts. Better to think in terms of a conflict of interest. He has his reasons, we have ours. Hopefully, we win.
the path to hell is paved with good intentions. danzo was like hitler - he believed he was right. doesn't change the fact his methods and results were completely evil.
@superlevelhelper. You are lucky, all I ever learned from my chemistry teacher is how to cook crystal meth...
@stardude692001 Did you have Mr. White as a Chem teacher, as well? I love that dude. Some awkward moments in class though. I think he was going through something at home.
The best filler in the series, really worth watching.
And this is why this is the "anime" not the "manga" why would the book be the same as the story. The anime story writers are showing creativity. Such a concept is lost amongst you people.
lol ppl should just enjoy the episode if its good, not analyze so much whether its content is in the manga or not.
386chaos - It's because animes aren't known for reinterpreting the manga they use as source material. They are, however, known for adding additional content when they are catching up to the manga.
jermox you deserve all the thumbs up!! This is how it is (although when they do reinterpret it sometimes sucks).
Well I for one don't care about anything if it wasn't in the manga. But to each their own I guess. Funny how people down vote comments that aren't bad, but are annoyed that they left the good battle for a filler arc.
At that of appointment of Minato as Fourth hokage ... there was a bit Naruto...in him
i was thinking that we might see a very similar looking moment not too far from now. or writers could pull the ultimate troll move and naruto could sacrifice himself in the end of the show.
I don't think it'll end with Naruto becoming Hokage :/ But he won't die.
Ahhhh Danzo I had to go the to when Sasuke Killed him, now i feel better
at least these fillers are cooler than the ones they gave us before!
At least it contains information that can possibly directly correlate with the current battle vs Obito. Idk if they were in the manga or not, but still wouldn't label this filler.
Filler= Irrelevant to the story (aka Ramen Ninja episode, or the ones with that damn ostrich) This: very relevant to the story= Not filler. This is all background story. All of this has been hinted at throughout the series. Now we know.
Filler to manga may not be considered filler for the anime maybe?
some of the previous fillers were good
regardless whether it's relevant to the story line: if it's not part of the manga, it's filler. if it's part of the manga, it's canon -- pretty simple.
i dont want to see danzo's stupid face anymore. I will probably destroy the screen if i do.

In a good way.
Kushina is so cute though.
That one moment made this whole ark even more awesome
kushina is awesome... lol sakura sucks though
Are you kidding me? Sakura is amazing. Have you even kept up with the manga? She is actually being a MAJOR help and a great fighter. Hinata on the other hand..as always, is completely useless.
ANBU Kakashi action has finally begun! Can't wait to see Yamato as well! ANBU Kakashi and ANBU Yamato~!
Don't forget ANBU Itachi!
Having Naruto's voice actor do young Guy is really not sitting well with my ears! The other younger versions of the cast fit quite well, but think that was an odd choice. Whenever teen Guy talks I just hear Naruto. :-/
thats what it is!! it does sound weird.
LOL i didnt actually notice it was naruto's voice actor who did guy haha
Right, me neither. And I don't think so, I think it is Konohamaru's voice.
Will I ever lessen my hate for Danzo?...i think not. WAR7C98GPJZ
it lessened after they showed his backstory when he died, but now it's started to flare up again.

Kakashi gave me goosebumps at the end
You're not the only one
