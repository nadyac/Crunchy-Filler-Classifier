Too bad the Jupongatana was used only as diversion, although they are strong enough to defeat the Oniwabanshu. It seems the good guys are losing at all sides at the moment.
Why is this a negative comment? Hahaha. It's kinda true. LOL.

Kaoru's journey for Kenshin is one of the most beautiful parts of this anime......
yeah it's called Meiji Swordsman ROMANTIC STORY
Kaoru was getting on my nerves too but it's looking like she might become more useful. At least she finally ditched that kimono. Maybe we'll even get to see her fight. Misao, Yahiko, and Sanosuke have all leveled up - hope she does too.
