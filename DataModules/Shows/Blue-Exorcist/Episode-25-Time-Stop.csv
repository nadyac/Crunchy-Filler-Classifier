They never did explain anything about the kid with the hand puppet.....
Archangels are supposed to be pure beings of light, to look in their eyes is to go blind, and to hear their voices is to go deaf. Mightn't we then assume that perhaps he's the mouthpiece/observer of an archangel?

I was sure this episode they would explain, but no. Trolololol.
It is explained in the manga in a later arc
they never explained izumo's history either (she had a flashback that they never discussed)
Aww that was a good show. I wonder if Shiemi and Rin ever went to the amusement park though
i dont think there going to make another one this episode was made to stand on its own
Yeah, with the exception of Bleach, I prefer to buy all my manga, to support the writer. (Let's face it, Bleach is only worth reading, not buying, and Tite Kibu isn't exactly wanting for funds.)
finished it during work with some overtime
which manga issue does this part take place?
Zombie this doesnt take part in any issue because the story changes at volume 4 or 5
Whoa. I finished an anime in two days. Oops.
Same.
I did it in a day!
It took me so long to finish this. I didn't want to finish it because it was so good so I put it off for a while. The ending was cute though and I like that Kuro was included more in this last one.
Wow, 666 likes. That's pretty good. No one change it, because it fits perfectly.
An hour? You sure that 24 x 25 is 60?
I absolutely loved the soundtracks in this episode! Does anyone know what the piano song was when they visited her grave? I would love to learn it! Lol near the end I was like "What is this, Durarara?" The Ghost Rider reminded me of Celty.
I was flipping out when I heard that, because Ghost Rider is one of my favorite movies, and I'd compared the titular character to Rin, so even though it wasn't the same one, it was cool to see a quasi-mention.

Lmao I thought it really was Celty for a second
Yah me too. I was like "really? A crossover now? Lol"
In one episode, The kid with the hand puppet was sitting on a construction site, narrating for some reason. So is he like the Morgan Freeman of Blue Exorcist?
He reminded me of the Anguished One from Devil Survivor 2 when he was doing that.
exactly omg blasterbro!!!!!!!!!!!! exactly ehat i thought of....i feel like he is just there to be there...like he is a being of different nature
Simply no, cause he only narrated like for a minute, and you can not compare the voice of Morgan Freeman to anyone.
Lmfao, Morgan Freeman is His OWN entity...Even in Anime's. XD
Morgan Freeman is god what you talking about >.>
I don't know what to do with my life since this is over ._.
Yokumizu, as a teenager, I too had to learn to adapt to acronyms. SAO is Sword Art Online and AoT is Attack on Titan.
SAO was the first anime i watched and now im just hooked...
SAO is my shitz. i actually cried. . . idek why it was just that good
I want a Season 2 SO BAD... ;_;
theres like 4 seasons, Sword art online, Alifilem (spelled wrong), Gun-Gale online, and Sword Art Online II. and all in order
Well... Time to read the manga!
if only i had the manga :/

You can buy the manga on amazon, rightstuf, and i'm pretty sure viz media is selling it online as well. Rightstuf is rather expensive though, so I would look at the others before there.
ALREADY THERE! =D
awsome, i loved it, im also glad that it had 25 episodes, ihate it when an awsome series ends in 12 episodes, am i right?
Sometimes the most beautiful endings are done on the 13th episode, and then ruined by continuation. Some are better with just 13, some better with 50. No one needs another bleach/naruto/one piece epidemic. Except the amazing Hunter x Hunter
Amazing Anime. Just fantastic. <3
why is it the truly epic animes r way 2 short?
Often times, that is what makes them epic. Cause they understand that a great story has a beginning and an END. Usually nothing is worse for an anime, than to drag it out forever.
That sounds familiar... I'm not gonna say any names.... *cough* Bleach *cough* (T 3 T)
*coughcough*Naruto*coughcough*Onepeice*cough*
true lol
Stewker- true, but they are often TOO short. this should have been at least 10 episodes longer. same with SAO and Hellsing and (if they don't make a second season) AoT
like this comment to get a second season
They cant really make a second season because they strayed from the manga half way through. if they did, the story wouldn't really make sense anymore. of course they could remake it :p
this IS the second season...
@BlueBerryAssassin That happened with FMA so they made FMA brotherhood. I hope they do that with Ao No Exorcist haha. ^_^
@xxxkillermia Actually, I think Rin said he wanted to beat the shit out of Santan instead of actually kill him though. Then again I could be wrong because translations sometimes end up being different.
I want it SO BAD, but it's pipe dreams more than likely...
Not sure how they can continue after beating Satan, the most evil of all evils. I hope they can do this without messing up the story.

Spoiler much >_>
i personally like it when animes only have one season, at least when the end is wrapped up pretty well. i had to stop watching naruto and bleach :/
They could just remake this anime.... but this time follow the manga >.>
Good observation... Hahaha. XD
LOL DURARARA REFERENCE AT THE END!
mmmm celty lol
Lol ikr? Right when I heard ghost rider and saw the helmet,I said Why's Celty here? o.o
Celty. <3
After all this, man I kinda wanna see more...But, I gotta ask if Satan wanted a body that wouldn't burn...Why didn't he possess a cockroach? XD Wouldn't that have survived?
[This comment has been removed]
Maybe he did... But it was in a house the exterminator was visiting that day... o.o
If he truly wanted an invincible body, he should've possessed a nokia phone~
@TheVast LMAO
Oh, but I did have one problem... wtf was with the hand puppet guy?? I was expecting him to eventually have a purpose like Shura, who also began as a mystery character, but he NEVER did anything. Unless I missed something??
Well...he spoke ._.
im thinking he knew of what was kind of happening..so I think that would make him a prophet..
exactly cruxsin
Well, can't wait till " Blue Exorcist: Brotherhood" ...... Get it , eaahahahaaaa!?!?
Yeah I actually do hope that they make another anime after the manga is finished

[This comment has been removed]
Y U NO GO LONGER BLUE EXORCIST?
This ending was unacceptable
[This comment has been removed]
14:55 Both were thinking, "we could make this a three-way"
Finished this anime in one day. Mission accomplished. A really good anime to make me keep watching till this time of night
You're TRULY a trooper!
so basically the puppet guy is the morgan freeman of this show?
