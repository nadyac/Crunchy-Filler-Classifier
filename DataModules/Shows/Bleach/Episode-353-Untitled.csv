Thanks.
and have that cliche super long hair because EVERYBODY knows that when your body can't handle your powers it is transferred into your hair
Really the boy i need to use all my powers thats locked up in my hair........i'm a dude who has his sister putting it into long pony tails thats how serious it is so u think i'll end up like Ichigo chat or kenpachi maybe even Yamamoto
you will never be me human
well in yamamotos case the powers are in the beard
I miss old man Zangetsu


That was clever, MrGrevier. lol. Huge spoiler for the non-manga reader, but clever indeed.
Hey WrittenShadow spoil it for me. Could you explain MrGrevier13's joke to me?

full bring + bankai + hollow mask at its full power + hell suit (from the hell bleach movie) + in full controll + epic moment music = OP ichigo that can cut the universe in half with one swing
I think he would just blink and it would implode lol.
blink and explode......................SHIT HE SURPASS THE GODS! but in truth i wonder if ichigo walked to skool with the Hell Bankai i wander what ppl would say i mean he walk up and say good morning with hells will as his body guards ^_^
Ichigo fart = nuclear holocaust
what about vasto lord ichigo
Tsukishima really seems like a wannabe Ichimaru Gin for me...or maybe I just miss Gin too much. LOL
Nothing say "I want to protect you" more than capturing someone and hitting save.
People actually caring about structural damage in Bleach? Mind blown.
hmm. it turned into Scott Pilgrim
Why are so many people calling this filler? Read the manga people, if you're not you're missing out... on a lot...
LOLOLOLLOL....."save game"
Now if Shippuden would only get on with it, I could be a happy person... BTW Go Ichigo!!
that was good.. I still miss Nel..
Find it funny how these guys, who know nothing of Ichigo's past, try and tell him he knows nothing. Fullbringer is just anther type of spirit manipulation, and Ichi was probably the strongest reaper in history.
To everyone commenting: Everything must go on. We miss the old, of course. But we need to keep moving forward.
Haha, father daughter love!
@snow1wolf if this was a filler arc then they wouldnt have made chad and Orihimes powers fullbring. if it was a filler then it wouldnt have anything to do with ichigo getting his powers back.
Nh? ROFL!!! 1) Nazi's stole that, it's originally a symbol for harmony, peace... 2) In Bleach it is Manji, symbol for 'Ban' meaning 'full' - Full Release, or y'know, Bankai! And the manji symbol is Zangetsu's handguard.
Why isnt Soi Fon In This I Wish T_T
Why aren't any of the good characters
because they can't be remember ichigo lost all his powers including seeing spirits and death gods
quincy the ichigo
sexy ichigo!!! rawr~
Needs more Orihime,
@melbug. yea but visard and hollow are kinda one abillity for him. also he only have fullbringer atm. but i agree that hes awesome for being able to fight with just what he can get
