So this really did happen in a way: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/history W all know how religion tends to bring out the violence over history, this is one of the times Christians were the victims.
The lack of belief in a being called "God" does not make it a "non-religion." There is always something that becomes the "higher power"--money, humanism, military might, race, you name it. All of these things are used to justify cruelty.
Also, history tends to document more instances of violence rather than non-violence. Even today, it's the radical extremists who take the spotlight on the news, even though for every extremist there are 100 peaceful believers of a faith.

You don't need a good reason to kill. The gains just have to be worth the costs. 25yrs-to-life makes it too costly these days. Lower it to a couple years and watch the heads fly.



his fist and his ribs are still busted from his fight with Anji

He killed to protect his family. The Bible says its the responsibility of men to protect their families. Turning the other cheek doesn't apply unless its another Christian, which clearly they weren't.
So...rocks fall, everyone dies?
