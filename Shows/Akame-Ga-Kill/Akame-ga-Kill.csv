The show ended well for the fact that there's like no lose ends... or cast left. The show itself went from meaningful deaths to... well, killing off people for the sake of it, and I think that's what kept this from being a great anime.
well maybe that ornament tatsumi had could save him somehow

So no chance of season two then lol


if i am not mistaken the gun the minister used looks like one of those from the early ages. They only have one bullet then they need to reload which takes like a minute or so, so she could have survived if it wasn't a magical gun.
she didn't want medical attention everybody dead she wanted to join the "not alive" party



You should see a doctor about that. Or exorcist. Stat.
Murame was often called "the cursed sword", so obviously it's not without consequence to use it on Akame.

After losing pretty much every1 & Tatsumi (She loved him 2 ways brother/future bf) Yeah she didn't wanna live anymore. Its her life it might be a little selfish for her to live Akame but it would also be selfish and cruel to make her stay

I think PikaPokit summed this up pretty well.
whats the name of the guy with the green hair. cant remember but how he died was fkd...I knew he was either gonna die a horrible or a awesome death but that was brutal
There is no more night raid.....just 2 people living on borrowed time
Well that was a feel trip. Time to watch happy funny anime lol
This anime just loves to rip your heart out and stomp on it



;( I lovws Sheele
Seriously...:(

Dudeman you are right, actually. But still, I did spot some areas where character deaths were completely written in way too hard. Lubbock for example. His death literally had to bust through a few brick walls to actually happen.
Also, that gun looks like a flintlock. How the fuck did it shoot like ten times.
For her being an 'assassin': yes, it was unnecessary because it simply lacked continuity with the rest of the show. She just suddenly stopped being able to move intelligently against her weakest/slowest enemy.
Wave survived until the end folks. Praise the sun!
The manga is fairly different
inb4 he gets darkwraithed in undead parish
Oh Rito2Ru, thank you for saying that. I know I'm last on the Dark Souls boat, so I've been saying that recently, but I'm glad that some people do so too
PRAISE THE SUN INDEED!!!!!!

Welp Tatsumi.. that's one way to "break the ice" with the ladies.
Breaking up with someone? Dude, that's cold.
all the puns lol
you saw a chance, and you took it
no.
No thank you. I'm in mourning. ;~;


No its fine they used the fable 3 standard flintlock...
You know the best ending are the ones that make you feel happy that the show is finished and not angry or questioning the ending. Akame ga Kill has a solid ending that wraps up the emotional journey all of us have been through.
Read the Manga, its a lot better then the series. So far its not turning out like this mutation.
well crap now i have to go read the manga

There's really no point in any of them surviving except for Najenda and Akame... Najenda helped rebuild the kingdom, and Akame took the blame for Night Raid's "evil". Leone did her duty, then left to be with her comrades in the afterlife.
Leone was just part of the team so that she could kill the minister, mission accomplished, time to die. Essentially the same thing with Tatsumi, got money to the village, then died. Kinda funny actually
Thanks to Esdeath, they can't even bury Tatsumi now...
He at least could have been buried properly next to his friends. Thanks icebitch, I'm sure he appreciates you even more now...
It took your comment for me to realize how much of a dick move that was.
yep, she was like, "He's mine, bitch. I'm taking him with me."

Hyped for the finale of Akame ga Kill Everyone Off!
I don't think I would say it was one of the best. I mean this with respect but it wasn't all that exciting. I would say aldnoah zero was probably the more grabbing one. Especially that ending.
I would agree, however this has a beginning, a middle, and an end, whereas Aldnoah has a "start" and a middle. I know Aldnoah has another season coming next month, but it is not fair to judge a trilogy by the first two books.
At least this gave us a reasonable resolution. I won't be watching Aldnoah. That was a ridiculous ending, and they're going to have to do some ridiculous contortions to get themselves out of what is obviously a planned shocking ending.

@gpiechocki She can change her appearance to one form, and that's the form we've already seen. Changing her appearance doesn't protect her from a head shot either.

Just look on the bright side, right?
That's how I had to take it.
Part of me wants to take the symbolism and chuck it all the way to that remote island that Tatsumi and Esdeath were on episodes ago, but another part of me thought it was beautiful, despite the fact of how sad it was T-T

fucked his shit upppppp
Her death is reminiscent of what a wounded animal does when it knows it is about to die.
@Ebony467 some might say... a Herone? I'll let myself out.

Leone's all that kept me coming back ;~;
A more realistic end. No one lives happily ever after. Clean up is a bitch. Heros are often vilified.
Yup, and it's this kind of realistic outcome that is causing so much butthurt, I love it.
War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse. How do you figure, Hawkeye? Easy, Father. Tell me, who goes to Hell? Sinners, I believe. Exactly. There are no innocent bystanders in Hell. War is chock full.
@TaroSatomi Close, it's unrepentant sinners, otherwise all men and women would be damned
@TaroSatomi Ooh. quote. nice.
"They needed to give slightly happier ending to counterbalance the weight of the show" - NO! The best art is not that which gives the fans what they want - far from it. Plus you know this ending is more impactful than a happy ending.

It was pretty clear she wanted to die. I mean seriously, everyone she cared for in her life died save for two people. After getting gut shotted like 10 times in a place that is gonna take months to rebuild, it seemed like she wanted death.
50 Cent got shot 9 times and lived and he NEVER had an imperial arms. I call foul. 7/10
50 Cent can go to a hospital with a better than medieval level of technology. Remember the imperial arms aren't something that is within the tech level of the existing empire.
50 cent's hat is his imperial arms
the internet never ceases to make me laugh
I hope this is gonna be like the new version of FMA. In that where they have an anime version where about halfway through they add their own creativity but in a few years we get an anime dedicated to the manga.


We all knew when we began to read akame ga kill that is wasn't going to be a bright and cheery manga. While i did not enjoy reading the first extra chapter and the wild hunt arc i feel that they helps show how rotten the capital was.
@Fullmetallegend yeah but killing Shura in here wasnt as fulfilling as killing the cuntbag shura that killed Bors' family. that was one of lowest points for the series that builds anticipation for whats gonna happen to them.
WAIT ! WAIT WAIT WAIT JUST A FUCKING MOMENT !!! Did we just see a possibility for a second !?!?!?
Ufotable might do it if we all chip in. I know I'd watch the hell out of that.
It is very possible they could make a series for Akame Ga Kill Zero. The manga isn't that far in but I wouldn't be surprised if they did
Link for what the author said?

I'm bawling my eyes out just for Leone. My eyes couldn't possibly handle anymore. Any more shots to the heart and I'd be drowning in my tears
Mixed feelings about how this ended.
So Akame's trump card is kinda terrifying.
it's like bloodthirster in league but without the cap.
sword of occult. endless stacks.
lol league of legends came out of nowhere :D, but hey they will make nice champs
Mejai's Soulstealer..... If you know what I'm talking about
I would also point out the part she threw out there about feeling their pain and sorrow; it doesn't kill her sure, but Christ can anyone imagine having the emotions and maybe thoughts and memories of all the people you have killed in you?
