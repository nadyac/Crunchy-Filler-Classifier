Stay tuned next week! The real season 2 begins!

Ace of the Recap
so did everyone else fast forward to see if it was a recap too?
no just read the comments xD
same just came to check the comments
I saw the star rating and instinctively knew.
This many recaps in a row should be illegal...
Of course you know next week will be yet another recap right?
So the guys over at Naruto shippuden should pretty much be condemned for life!! lol
Next week the new season FINALLY happens! No more recaps!
False Advertising yet again! Season 1 material... Come on. Do better!
I hope no one spoils this episode.
The directors of this show really love those journalists.
Are they even going to be of any significance later on?
this show is so fucking brutal. its pretty good when its not dragged out as hell, now they spend 3 episodes doing a recap?
Brace yourselfs. Real season 2 is comming.
yup, another recap
looks to be the end of the recaps.... thank god.
Luckily it seems like this is the last recap. Thank GOD
There was exactly one interesting moment this episode. At 21:55 the ace pitcher of Teito appears, which will be a new rival school this season. Skip there, then watch the preview, and you're done.
Don't bother. Just a waste of time.
You know, I was so happy when I saw this show was continuing so soon after the previous season... guess the joke was on me.
sigh.........
Recaps over, next week: Ace of the Flashbacks
Aw, they didn't use the 1st OP this time. Well, at least they're still mixing it up a little bit.
I wouldn't be so annoyed if it weren't for the fact that there is nothing else to watch on Mondays. Well, at least this was the last one.
