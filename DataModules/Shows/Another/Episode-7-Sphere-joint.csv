Good morning class, today's lesson is...ANATOMY! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
DIEsection
gold
Lmao I really needed this comment with all the darkness in this show
This episode was a pain in the neck.
He must've had a sore throat.
I thought the knife was going to go spinning and kill a random student lol

Me too i thought it was going to hit the girl on front row LOL.

Me too!
Is is bad that I was a little disappointed that it didn't?
Slowly scrolls down reading the spoiler comments.......
Me too.
Ikr!
Lol always
WHO COMES BACK INTO CLASS AFTHER THIS??!?!?!?! THIS SCHOOL DOESN'T GIVE TIME OFF AFTER SH#! LIKE THIS?
lol that would be my school. Every natural disaster could be hitting my school at the same time and we'd still have school.
still get chills from watching this
Kaseda is wrong because how else would the kid have said "I got put into the cursed class 3" meaning that the whole schools knows.
While everyone might know the class is "cursed", if you recall quite of few people also didn't fully believe it, not to mention that only members of Class 3 knew the story behind the curse.

Same XD

She did say dolls are connected to death.
dolls....beautiful and will kill you in your sleep
Wait, so if she's just a normal girl, how is the doll power real then?

but then it seemed to do nothing but to fall down!! LOL

okay the part where she was like "the dead one is .... you?" was reallly creepy
Yeah whoever wrote this is a mad genius
or just mad
Hardly genius writing. It is still an entertaining enough show, though. I like some of the themes going on and the general vibe of the series.
After watching this at 3 in the morning, I was like, "Well, who needs sleep?"
same ^
Dude, don't physiologically scar them. Kill yourself in your own spare time.
i think thats payback for the BS he suffered as a teacher
You mean "Psychologically" ?
Only personally he physiologically scarred was himself.

yeah it did seem like he was being possessed, especially how he walked to class and stuff. Also with the way he "killed" his mother that he was living with to take care of.. it had probably been trying to kill him for a while.




The survival instinct is one of the most basic and powerful drives that humans have. Even people who seriously want to die have trouble overcoming it. I don't think it's very strange that he had to force himself to do it.
What? Nobody got any days off after that? No counselling? Japan's tough.
NO BREAK! Study now you be doctor!
You cure yourself when you doctor!
Teacher: school is over rated....
I was kind of expecting the teacher to either pull a head out of the bag, or a gun and shoot up the class, well at least it would have been a gun if it was America lol.
I like how they all waited until he killed him self, and THEN ran. -__- I would have been out of that freaking door the moment he pulled out that knife.
I would have ran up to him and stopped him, I come from a military family though....
the bag was pretty heavy for it just to be a knife or he just slammed the bag down
LOLOL! These comments are too funny, I would have ran out the door too @ElissaMarieeee
gunslinger in reality u wouldnt have done anything and this is coming from a grunt
Those kid's are scarred for life.
Seems more like they all already forgot about it..
when something paranormal is going down the logical thing to do is GTFO , i don't care if i get disowned for dropping out im out of there

What a great way to start off this bloody episode
now class, pay attention. I can only do this once!
It wouldn't fit the feel of the show, but good god damn that would have been a terrific line!
LMAO!!! BlackRavenOfTheSand, that was great.
fk that im going back to Tokyo
lol exactly what I would do!
