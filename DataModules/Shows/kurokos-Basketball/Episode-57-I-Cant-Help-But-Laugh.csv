lol anyone notices the small evil aura that coming out of Moriyama at 11:03?
he was simply in the game.
That was aura. I thought that was just my video glitching out on me.
^LOL I was worried about that also. XD
clearly using hollow powers to supress the urge.
that was a bit of Goku oozing out surely?
Kise of the Sharingan
Oh,,,, I'm in.... Then... Akashi is Madara Uchiha~~~ ^_^ Who is Naurto??? :XD Aomine??? or Shin-Chan??? :XP
Kise is my new favorite. Surpassing even Kagami and Kuroko.
@Heedless. I considered him a hybrid of the Uzumaki clan(His red hair) and Uchiha clan(His Sharingan-like Emperor Eye)
@Moneeb23 ^_^ *Nod* Agree ^_^ I like the way you are seeing..... Watching these boys play since day-one..... put a smile on my face every time..... ^__^
If I could edit my comment, I would add on to "Kise of the Sharingan, the new coming of Kakashi Hatake." Coming in theaters near you...Probably an awesome movie xD
Here we go boyssssssss
THANKS!!!!......and don't you want "Here we go GILRS" too??????? ^_^ This is Kise we are talking about.. so..... GILRS........here we go girlssssssss!!!!! :XP

^Pretty much sums up the end of every sports competition in anime. For the losers mainly.
man even i cried when he started crying. then midorima had to cry too and made it worse
i shed so many tears at that scene like takao and midorima stop pls. be happy that you got to play your heart out on the court. my tear ducts can't handle the sadness Q__Q
Remember when we though the ally oop in the practice game in the beginning was badass? times were simpler I tell you what
Can we all just mention how awesome Kuroko's vanish drive was in this episode it was definitely more like teleportation
I really hope during the duration of this game Kuroko goes in the zone, that would be amazing!!



Word to the wise. If you want to be first picked for the basketball team, remember to color your hair. Plain hair people fill any remaining spots.
I haven't read the manga but I think we all know Kise is going to be basically dead after this game.
as if the generation of miracles wasn't OP enough.. lets just combine them all together, shall we?
So nice to Kise's God mode animated. His glowing eyes are intimidating O.O
Agreed. He's like a freaking cat.
i love how murasakibara was just like i hate all of you right now. it's like your trying to make me look bad
Kuroko disliked you Kise. It's okay though, he meant it in a good way.
who else is waiting for it by the second?
Damn... not even a handsake!!! Takao/Shin-chan's crying faces were so heartbreaking!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
