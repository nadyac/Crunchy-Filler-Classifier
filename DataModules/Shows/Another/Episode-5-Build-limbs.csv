Kira, AKA Light Yagami, is the main character in Death Note.
Death Note...AKA one of the coolest shows where someone can look good eating a potato chip
Or an apple
10:32 LEOLUCH FACE
He does looks like Light when the kid's having a heart attack
I find it funny how no one ever calls the ambulance and just accepts the fact that the person died lol
They probably did but it was too late
the teachers just kinda say god damnit not again
"He's dead Jim" thats the phrase that comes to mind for casual death.
i can imagine them making bets on who is gona die next, kinda making it into a game lol
That'd be so morbid
anyone notice the titles are like the building of a doll? o____o
I did. o_o and i'm like... oh
The dead one is a doll.
i just noticed ..
Fucking creepy!
It seems odd that Kouichi's mother died 15 years ago, at the same time his aunt was in class 3... Also, silly question, but if they don't actually tell him him the rules, how do they expect him to know them?
Ikr it is a bit interesting that his mother died 15 years ago when his aunt was in class 3. Maybe the aunt went poking around...
The Librarian's comment seemed to have hinted to this thoery or did no one catch that?
I'm speculating that the aunt didn't follow the rules and caused his mother to die. That's why the parrot keeps saying "Why Rei?" That's my guess.
I was just about to write that down!
His aunt probably had to do with something involving her death.... I think the bird speculation might be spot on and I mean she even got mad at the bird. I think it runs deeper than just annoyance. That bird is onto something.
It wasn't a heart attack, someone wrote his name in the death note.
don't they teach CPR at this school?
LOL thats funny
foxdie
is the principle stuiped or what if that happen like 2 or 3 time just shut down the school and make new one
It was the other dumb black haired dude from death note.. he is an idoit ....he mustve made a mistake!!
Fuck this, I'm staying an all-nighter.
are you fuking bat shit crazy
Time to basically anime binge the crap out of this series
sadly this happens to every 12-14 episode anime i watch

I. Can't. Stop. Watching. This... =.= screw homework, i have anime and a dormroom. that's all I need.
do 3 of my 60 math problems every half episode ._.
i try to cram in problems during the commercial breaks! at least there good for that!
I have to wake up in an hour...
If I was the main character I would throw a chair in the middle of class and yell at everyone and say "Fuck you selfish little bitches! Just explain things to me and tell me the damn rules!"
ya da whole classroom would then explode from ur shout and everyones eardrum would get blown up!!!!! LOL
Making an episode in class... would cause lots of dead bodies and then you wouldn't do it anymore just because you'd be traumatized, or maybe one of the classmates would lose it and kill you to stop it all who knows..
If I was him I'd attach rockets to the bottom of my chair and explode into the ceiling!
That reference Marshall...that reference.
I could not agree with a comment more. How is he just cool with all this? Finally some answers though.
man, he's really patient with all the cryptic talk around him. i know i would flip out and just tell them to start making some sense.
Nah, best way to react is to start sexually harassing the most attractive person in the classroom...that'll stop the ignoring...
But then more people would die.
nah he should just tell the whole class to knock off the BS or he will curse them for real.
I would seriously flip if everyone knew a secret EXCEPT me -.-
Heh, i figured you didn't know yet........
How would you not know? Gosh.
Its obvious that whoever tells him anything about it will die yet he keeps at it >_>
So then WRITE IT in a hospital!! so they can trat u right away and BE ON the FIRST FLOORR!!!
Undertaker Joey, I love your profile pic :]
I'm suspisious of the goddamn annoying bird... Hmm... MAYBE HE CAUSED THE DEATHS. He could of chewed the ropes of the elevator, drop some shit of the stairs for the girl to slip and chase the boy around to make him have a heart attack. >:O
Why? Why, Jez-chan?
It all adds up I'm such a fool why couldn't I see this before..

LOL!!!! HAHAHAHAH!! ya da bird posses da spirit of the dead girl~~~~
this episode makes EVERYTHING SO MUCH CLEARER and this episode makes me wish there was another anime with the same characters but it is not horror but more romantic focusing on Mei and Kouichi
if this happened to me id go in early and flip their desks upside down every day...
i like this episode :D sure im still terrified, but i can't stop watching it :3
his class is full of bitches
they don't wanna die.. is all.
The opening theme sounds like something that they'd put in Rozen Maiden...
It's the same singer for the openings. ^^
