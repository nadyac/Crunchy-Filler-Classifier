Most educational show of the season and most realistic one imo. I hope this gets a season 3 or something. Need more Mikage, Hachiken, chicken, horses, cows, pork bowl.
NOOOOOOOO Y MUST IT END HERE Y ?YYYYY??? :(

yes I read that they were going to release episodes between last year and this year but the manga still ongoing so there might be a 3rd season or a few episodes extra. I also liked this anime, I want to see more
omg i cant believe it ended....so quick...i need moreeeeeeeee!!!!!! 3rd season nao please.
Lest us not forget our favorite background characters- horse/cheese sensei. rice/chicken sensei. beer/pig sensei, and the principal and great-granny and all their famous one liners. And let us pray for more Tokiwa abuse.
Lol that one teacher. "It goes well with beer" "I HEARD BEER" while bringing a full tank of it xD
Rice sensei always comes with the most epic dramatic entrance.
my kind of teacher lol.
an epic feast to end an epic series- Gochisou sama deshita!
*Keg
Now if only there was a teacher who heard "Season 3." This show was way too good.. RIP Pork Bowl.
Tamako clearly has no time for teenage boy drama. She'll hit you before you can even finish your sentence and move on. I really enjoyed this season. I'm in agreement that maybe Hachiken's dreams are endless from here on out.
Season 3!!!!!!!!!
I think I just watched the best anime ever.
I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO END HERE! :<
I'm going to need a 3rd season. They left way too many things unfinished
Agreed we so need a 3rd season the manga is still ongoing and there is sooooo much left that's really good
Yea I'm waiting for a season 3. I don't want it now though if they are gonna rush it and do the same thing as they did with Full Metal Alchemist so I say its better to be patient
I agree. Though I may start a revolt if they don't end up giving us a season 3.
Props to Hachiken forward standing up to his dad. He has definitely evolved over the course of the series
Yes! I'm guessing in Season 3 (it just can't be finished), his dad will either come through I the end and the most hellashish lesson will have been learned, or he becomes an even bigger asshole.
His Dad is very interesting, makes you think "is he really the bad guy he's mad out to be?"
I was hoping Hachiken would say something to his parents about being thankful for always providing for him after what he saw with the farm going down and the one character having to give up his dreams.
SEASON 3!
need a third season
Did anyone else notice that his dad showed up with a PLUNGER over his shoulder? I can no longer take that dude seriously.
You can hold up a bank with an old plunder. No one wants to touch that.
When I saw him with the plunger that was my first thought was he thought there was a thief in the hosue. And hell yeah, I wouldn't want that plunger anywhere near me. xD
a plunger is appropriate cos his pops is full of sh*t.
If I remember correctly in the manga his dad was home doing some plumbing.
Maybe he is a 'Plummer'....... Ben 10 needs some backup after all.
Hachiken's dad looks like he killed someone before
He looks like Scar.
^ I KNEW HE LOOKED FAMILIAR! I kept wondering who he looked like... Now it all makes sense.
I think the Scar comparison is appropriate. I seem to remember the Phys. Ed. teacher from the first season looking just like Armstrong from Fullmetal Alchemist.
scar from what?
Fullmetal Alchemist. Surprised you've never heard of that show... same lady wrote this manga.
I really like Tamako's no-nonsense attitude, even if it can get a bit scary at times.
That was a nice episode to raise my Spirits, I'm always happy watching Silver Spoon, The Anime in general is a Refresher.
Nothing beats a cockblock by adding a damn load of Tabasco sauce, and a tube of Wasabi.
Sriracha and El Yucateco habanero would heat it up a bit more...
lol That pig keychain.
It was like a little Porkbowl ^_^
Nooooo, I need more Hachiken X Mikage!
Hachiken, it was awesome seeing you develop throughout the show... man I really want another 3rd season of this.
We haven't even had a first 3rd season yet. Be patient and we may have multiple 3rd seasons to watch.
cmanes that was an amazing reply.
I can't watch this show without remembering Pork Bowl! Hachiken's scarf looks like Bacon...The picture when he walks into his house looks like his Mom literally framed the bacon he sent them... Scarf & Picture + Bacon = Pork Bowl.
I demand a season 3.
Hachiken really has grown. His dad is still a prick but at least his mom has had her eyes opened now, maybe she'll be able to influence her husband a little. That full ending theme though!
