as soon as tsunade said "ever since that time" i'm sure we all said FUCK.
i guess i'll ditch it for another year
Maybe we can just give Naruto and Bleach the DB Kai treatment when they're done. Cut out like 300 episodes of bloat from Naruto + Naruto Shippuden.
For once this filler doesn't seem too bad. Naruto filler is usually terrible T.T My question is why it's happening when the manga has already ended. At this point it just seems like a cash grab :/
Well at the very least this filler looks like it'll be interesting. It seems like it would be a whole lot of trouble to take everyone from Konoha to Suna between exam portions though.
Akaruiyami, the reason this is happening now is probably because episodes takes along time to be made, and when this was made they had caught up to the manga. and had to make some fillers while the episode writers wait
oh god, dont pause at 57-58 seconds
hawt
lol WTF now that's some scary shit :O
some episodes of Naruto have stellar quality, it's just that since it has hundreds and hundreds of episodes they need to spread of budget out, only major fight scenes or important moments get huge budget animation.
lol
If there's hundreds of episodes they are profiting from hundreds of episode and they also should be improving. Having lots of episodes is no excuse for poor quality.
this filler is so bad that other villages refused the invitation xD
I am starting to lose interest in this series. In the middle of a fight with passion, we keep getting jerked around. The more they break the rhythm the harder it becomes to rebuild it.
yup.. the flow of the entire 4th war has been ruined.. when i go back to find an episode i like i get lost in all the filler
@tadams9795 Also, don't forget that it was only a relatively short time ago that the manga ending was announced. I'm sure this episode was planned long before then.
How many years have you been watching his show? How many hundreds of episodes have you watched. And you're just now starting to lose interest? LOLOLOL
tsunade lol *fap fap*
Just like the term "honey dck" from the movie The Interview. The creators of this show is honey dcking the crap out of us viewers with filler episodes lol.
Shikamaru and Temari would make a good couple

No Naruto over new years and now we have to deal with completely unnecessary filler this week and next? Honestly this filler doesn't even propel the plot time to stop watching for a few weeks and wait it out

more flashbacks than family guy
Tsunade: "This is worse than that time we held a new chunin exam and none of he other villages showed up." *cut away to flashback*
lmao
that comment matches the reaction of optimus prime of how the viewers feel @xanxa
LOL
getting sick of the fucking fillers
But if they don't keep doing fillers they might catch up to the manga again!... oh wait.. it ended. -.-;
Oh man they are gonna cover how akatsuki captured Seven tails Fuu along with how Sakura and other Naruto's friends became Chunnin. I am honest excited about this. Sand rebels will an added treat as well.
Simple Question, is it cannon? Or rather did this EVER at any point happen in the manga, or are the animators pulling this out of their ass?
this isn't canon. this and the following episode were not in the manga. yes, the animators are making something out of their ass
And?...
Doesn't mean it can't be good though. I point you to the Kakashi filler arc and the power filler arc.
I love how theres a freaking bench press in the Raikage's office
Damn Fillers Wish they would just release them at the end of the series.But I guess thats how you keep the ratings for longer.

Flashback is a filler, if said flashback isn't in the original content.. in this case, yes it is filler content. ^_^
damn more fillers?, just get it over already. The manga ended last year.
These fillers and flashbacks are becoming cancerous. There's literally no need for them now. The hype of a particular characters ability that will happen soon is gonna boost the views heaps with Naruto. Hurry up, I was see a decent fight!
I actually like this filler. The politics of the five great nations has always picked my interest. I am looking forward to it.

Took CU6YRZRCC9T, thanks a lot!!!!!
9BCEKL53JVQ thnx;)))))
All I know is at the end it's pretty much saying, "fuck you all, we're gonna use fillers till the very end!" smh
AAHH the days where Kurama isnt tamed, Naruto doesnt know sage mode, and before everything got REALLY hectic. As much as i love action, i do like a little down time episodes to. Makes me feel as though Naruto wont end this year D=
With all the fucking fillers it probably won't.
I enjoy myself some down time episodes as much as the next guy. But, there's a time and a place for that and putting them right after the two main characters are supposedly dying isn't one of them.
Happy Birthday to somebody lol TY7N3WTQYL9 V93K7X6TDXC
