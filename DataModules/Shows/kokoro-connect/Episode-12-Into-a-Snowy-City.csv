We need diapers and... milk. *stare*
*little Aoki* BOOBS!!
OPAI!!!! little Aoki a hentai through and through
I'm guessing they didn't do too well in biology class. Thankfully, Inaba was there to point out the flaw in that knee-jerk logic.
Gotta love character development. I still can't understand how AnimeNewsNetwork is rating this show so low on their stream list. The animation, char development, drama, and the story line are all fantastic! Def my top show of summer.
I know why taich didnt want her to like him, because he didnt want to end up like school days
I disagree echoshadow5. After the body swapping, thing got much deeper, and more interesting.
It's ranked pretty good on MAL, that's what matters most. ANN rankings are kind of stupid.
Yeah man, the ratings on MAL come from such a massive pool of regular anime watchers and a lot of them are really into their critical ratings. They're not afraid of 1's and 4's which will have a big impact on the weighted average.
After going through all this these 5 should get some super powers
How hard is it to say, 'we're babysitting'? Really.
Isn't a shinkansen trip for two a really expensive way to tell a girl you haven't seen in years that you don't like her all that much anymore?
seems a phone call or a letter would have suficed and for around $400 less, notice they took the bus back? haha
Was the whole "I cut my hair at the end of last year" an "I'm trying to move on from you" thing?
A woman cutting off their hair means they are cutting away their past and moving on. So basically yes she said she moved on from him near the end of last year.
These 5 have truly been to hell an back

Whoa there Satan.
I think it would be awesome to be a little kid again and show my friends what I was like :3 and remember everything from when I was little. ^- ^
How come they all get to look so cute as children? Was I the only one to go through a wicked bad ugly duckling stage? O.o Still ADORABLE. It's nice to see the cast developing & growing; as good character development seems to be hard to find

That hug was too cute
When Yui said I love you to Taichi I thought "Noooooooo not School Days again"
I'm kind of annoyed about how Yui is constantly apart of the ones who are the center of attention. I mean Aoki is finally getting something where he gets more development and of course it revolves around his love or lack there of for Yui
I love This anime! I want more more! SEASON 2 IF YOU PLEASE!
I'm really glad there was finally an episode with a lot of Aoki in it he's my favorite
I laughed so hard "So we need diapers and....milk" ZOOMS IN ON INABAS BOOBS
*to cute girl with big bust* got milk?
Two new favorite animes, Kokoro Connect and Sword Art Online.
If you havent watched The Pet Girl from Sakurasou I highly recomend it! I watched SAO and that at the same time, and it was heaven!!!
hmm really that good?
Yes, to all three.
First world problems.. Can't give hugs to the opposite sex.
It's always so funny to laugh at other person's fears.
Does anyone else feel like Taichi is acting like a manwhore....
