DONT FORGET TYO WATCH AFTER THE CREDITS THERES ALWAYS A FEW MINS MORE OF THE EPISODE
@dish..lol always remember with anime if there is more than approximately 90seconds left from when the end credits start,at least scroll past them to see what is there. Many anime do after credit extensions~ either previews or continuations
Is it like that in every episode?
Dat ending tho....I"m laughing so hard!
Well I guess I'll have to watch the first few episodes again to see what I've missed.
That froggy was like "I'm dead, I just bit the son of Satan!"
This show is goddamn fantastic
The daydreams in anime are always amusing...
Ah fantasies, every anime character has them, and every person watching it has a laugh attack. :p
The opening is so awesome I don`t even want to skip it
same here it the only one that I don't skip!!!!
Why is Moriyama and the guy in the back with the robe, the only two without a school uniform...
well the uniform is for the high school,what if they're just going to the cram school?

T_T Can you ever become obsessed with watching an anime...?
yes e.e
Obsession is guaranteed, not a matter of "if" so much as "which episode."

The moment I started watching anime, it became a hobby, then as the numbers of anims grew it became an obsession, and after I discovered even more, it became an addiction, then as I reached 100 it became more of a lifestyle.
Ok, there we go. I'm addicted now. =___=
It's like: for the 96975874985967468747536437548657697597586th show I've seen xD
i have become to love the ending song !!!!!! ''ready ready ready for the take off!!!!!!!'' \(>o<)/
it reminds me of the 90s/00s boy band songs.... but you're right it is catchy
i know! so catchy!
I love the song too! I immediately downloaded the song!

Rin Is Adorable xD "When,huh? What year, what month, what day, what hour, what minute, what second? How many times did the planet spin that day?" LMFAO .
sugoro or whatever his name is, the guy with the black and white hair who got a 98% score in his test, he got the same voice actor as Zoro in One Piece.
and Hijikata Toshiro of Gintama!
Rin reminds me of Yoshimori from Kekkaisha....love the into tune
This show has the best music from any anime I've ever seen!
I just love his daydream self. I wonder if he will ever become remotely like that...
Another mind blowing episode. I hate that part of the episode is after the credits. Why do they do that? It's annoying.
lol the frog xD
Rin was pretty bad ass with the frog.
why do most main charcters in anime LOVE FOOD. Ex: Goku, Naruto, Nasgisa, Luffy, Inuyasha etc.
Who doesn't love food!!

Heh heh. If I was an anime character all I would be doing is eating. 1 hour later: AW IM STARVING! Friend: But you just ate! Me: AND?! MY STOMACHS DIGESTING ITSELF!
Looking at that list of characters though...that's a lot of action fightin sirs. Which burns a lot of energy. Which is replinished through food. Makes sense to me. Also, really, who doesn't love food? Nom.
