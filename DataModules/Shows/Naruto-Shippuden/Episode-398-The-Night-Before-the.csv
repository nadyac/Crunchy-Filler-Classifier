Fuu seems to be the Naruto element for this Chunin exam. She's the best new character on this show in awhile.
Khaltazar: possible typo (one english letter difference) versus a very specifically gendered title? Might want to reevaluate your criteria weighting.
They refered to Fuu as a girl THIS episode by her own comrades, so obvious typo the last time.

And here I was hoping that we would have a few episodes without a brash, loud, obnoxious child in a young adult's body. Oh well.
lmao was anyone else expecting shira to have a deeper voice ?
lol very much so! i was like wha...? he seemed like a manly type with a deep voice, but it was all soft sounding
gowther

Maybe in the dub they'll give him a deep one.
I am all up for expanding the Naruto universe (since I love it so much). But right now, I'd like to see the continuation of episode 393.
*continued* various characters of the series to expand on them each
Four-month long flashback from Guy Sensei averted!
I wish they saved most of the filler, and had just aired the main stuff. Then all this filler would be extra goodies instead of lettuce in a burger you don't really mind it, but you kinda wish it wasn't there.

Am I the only one who loves to sing with the intro?
Noooo I'm right there with you, I love the intro! But I've gotten to the point where I can't even watch it anymore because I just start squealing and get lost in a sea of feels >D
even the fillers are dragged out... One whole episode and the 2nd stage hasn't even started
Where as I was almost disappointed we cut directly to them getting to the location of the next stage instead of observing teams competing to get there on time. All in all, this seems in line with the first exam.
Exceot the first exams were not filler episodes placed right in the middle of a very important fight.
this filler is good, but i feel it doesnt have the feel of the original chuunin exams.. esp with orochimaru, it was really amazing.. speaking of which i might rewatch those old episodes sometime x)
Personally, I think this filler arc is great. Also, this episode was not pointless at all. It introduced characters that will most likely come into play later on.

When i finished watching this episode, I realized that absolutely nothing happened.
Setting up characters and rivals mostly.

T'was the night before the second exam and all through the anime not a shred of plot was to be found...
I'm starting to like Fuu, feels like she's an amalgamation of Naruto and Luffy
[This comment has been removed]
now we just need to figure out whether or not she likes oniku ramen
Poor Fuu she was just like Naruto all she wanted was friends. But so lively
OMG a female Naruto wtf lol
these fillers are way to much about naruto, every other sentence is "this kind of reminds me of naruto". lame decent filler, stop saying everything reminds them of naruto lol
It's almost as if he's the main character.......
rcruzval123: It's almost as if the writers are hacks who don't know how to write independent characters who don't always harp on about the main character (i.e., they have no personality of their own).
Watching this makes me upset and sad that Fuu and Naruto never meet, bet they would have made a nice team like him a Killer Bee.
he met her soul once with the other tailed beast remember....
Everyone starts fighting, and Sakura is like "Meh, Imma stare at this wall for a while."
But I mean, that's about as useful as she is in the actual series so at least they're staying true to her character

Fuu is so lovely. <3

While they're on their filler spree, I wouldn't mind a flashback to Minato and his team during the Chunin exams....
