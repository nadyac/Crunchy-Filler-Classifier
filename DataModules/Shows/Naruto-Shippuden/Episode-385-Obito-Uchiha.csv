Naruto and Obito are nothing alike. Obito and Kakashi never kissed.
Obito wasn't completely pathetic either starting out
hmm but if kakashi and obito did kiss it would be WAY to unoriginal , like really , an exact past? . Its not like they're the same people who do the same things , its just tht they were very alike in their dreams and goals.
I really want to know the story behind Kakashi's father.
drake3176 he kinda was
True they were dramatic about the similarities, but they were really alike? They both wanted to become Hokage, they both had their loves and their rivals, they both went through hardships, and the culture of the leaf village?
Rin is like the perfect girl. She's nice like Hinata, but not shy and withdrawn like her. And you see Rin's compassionate side when she worries about Obito, as the others are laughing at him. Sakura is usually oblivious to Naruto's pain.
Most people are one-dimensional
^ pretty much
@leafmyst: So true
drake3716: You probably think that because you don't get out of the house much. That, or you don't know what one-dimensional means.
@Thekiwiki excuse u, ten ten is the queen yo <3 <3
Naruto's eyes look strange in this episode too. He looks a bit too much like a Bleach-alike character in a few stills. Animators can't hold their feels because Naruto is endin D:
yeah the eyes were super weird this time around
Different animators for each cour of episodes I guess. They seem to save the best animators for the best fight scenes (AKA Obito vs. Kakshi fight couple episodes back which was frickin beast).

the animation with the fight between naruto and pain is the best i gotta say! you could def tell that was someone different, like a mixture between shounen and cartoon with the speed and stretching of the faces and all that sort
Easier to fall in love with Rin than Sakura, she's not insanely violent.
could also be because rin is nice and not a compleete ass like sakura.
its eather that or sakura is always on her period.
lol
If anything Rin is waaaaay nicer, cuter and encouraging than Sakura
So yeah Obito, if you want to counter Naruto's claims that your lives are identical, just tell him that Sakura is not as sweet, yet she's still alive, that's two strikes.
best girl rin.
So much hate for Sakura. She's trying guys, but she's as dense as Naruto is. So many missed signals.......
That's one way to think of it. Of course, you could also say that Sakura's character is more upfront and honest. Obnoxious, sure, but honest.
SIGH. What a depressing episode.

No, 699 and 700 are the last chapters, and they came out today for us. Technically they don't officially release in Japan until next Monday, but we get the scans early.
It depends where you're looking. If you get the pirate translations, it's today. If you wait for the sanctioned Jump translations, it's Monday.
Even though it can be painful to take a moment to gaze into a troubled past, there are pivotal moments in life where reflection can give a better sense of which is the better path to tread.
Lol I just realized that Obito is a virgin
ooooh that is why they are so serious lol
did i miss the sex scene? XD
yeah when did naruto lose his v-card?
people are referring to the end of the manga where we see his kids.
And that's funny because...?
Yeah, it's getting fairly tedious now.
Ok, it's been mostly jokes up until now, but this episode was LITERALLY 80% Flashback, and %19 Talking!!! The %1 is whatever other content is in there. Not to mention, this animation is getting lower than the Pain arc.
The final chapter came out today... LET THEM DO THIS!
@ tamos47. Oh no,don't tell me you're gonna go path of vengence destroy all the world's photo's and selfies j/k. Actually, that's not a bad idea, less annoying celebrity madness. Do that one instead.
Yeah, they covered just half a chapter with this episode. Usually they've been covering 2 chapters per episode instead.
is it just me , or is the intro song very catchy?
love it
It's just you.
The manga is over I can't take this shit. Thankfully the anime is still here to soften the blow.

tbh Obito was just a horny jealous kid.
Yea, shows just how much of a difference our reactions to circumstances can make. Literally can save or destroy the world.
Well Rin did like Obito, and if Obito would just listen to Kakashi about Rins death...which she literally killed herself...they wouldnt be at each others throats. But obito...is to dang stubborn to hear and accept the truth.
Havok, in earlier episodes Obito said he knows that Rin killed herself, and watched the whole thing happen.
Obito knows Rin killed herself. But he hates the fact that Kakashi couldn't prevent it and save both of them.
Manga readers better tag their spoilers...

XD
T_T I'm crying, naruto is over! I'm happy but sad at the same time?!?! It was beautiful, i'm just sad it's over...the main story anyway

Yeah, jerks haven't been and I got some stuff spoiled. I anticipated it, but still... ):
Naruto manga ended today. 1 minute of silence!
more like 1 century of silence!
I get they need to fill time but come on we've seen basically that scene 10 times already. Obito was cool as a kid, we get it
Lol ya really
They don't need to fill time. The manga is OVER. The only reason to add fillers now is to milk the crap out of what is left.
moo QTPBJPHB9JB N89NCDTK5ZK P4BL48CAK45
P4BL48CAK45 claimed. I love you. I love you. I love you.
Naurtos ignorance is annoying. He can only see whats in front of him. Thinking that becoming the Hokage will change things but theres much more beyond that. I guess thats youth though. Obito is not wrong hes just going about it wrong.
He's going about it WAY wrong. He gave up hope too soon.
Obito...you are Obito. Shocking revelation.
that sure was one long talk.
I feel like naruto is a little out of charcter because he's being so serious lol.
Lol yeah I know right got his serious face on today
I kinda like it
Same story different day! what are we? Morons?
I agree
