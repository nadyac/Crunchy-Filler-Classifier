Why are people so eager about stating that they are first? Do they need our approval, for their own existence? Are kids lives really this sad nowadays? Consider me being "First" to tell you about reality. That's something to be proud of.
i mean its fun at first but when its everywhere it can get annoying ^^"
are you on drugs it just a game not to be taken seriously why are you so eager to look good on a forum full of stranger trying to make your self seem deep in smart over someone saying 1st comment get a life man
When i first saw this many years ago on Toonami, and now fully watching this subbed. I've gotta admit, there's nothing better than the originals. Both Anime wise and language wise. No offence but Japan does it better...
That's a very biased statement. I agree that the vast majority of anime just sounds better in Japanese but Steins;Gate, Fullmetal Alchemist, DBZ, Code Geass proved that the dub can be as good if not better! I prefer orig but quality dub wrk
I feel like the only dub char I have ever liked was Ginko from mushi shi. Idk the smoothness of his voice, and the way it is easier for me to catch spoken sarcasm in my own language made it. Some dubs are alright, but I prefer japanese VAs.
Cowboy Bebop dubs were also amazing in my opinion
i'll have to stop you there, code geass was disappointment , DBZ full metal were the best i've seen so far.
well for me both English n Japanese r okey... I don't really care but kenshin voice in dub it was pretty nice so it depends I guessss..
This is the greatest anime of all time and my personal favorite but it really wont be complete unless they add both OVA's
Im kinda disappointed that the people making this show chose to end the anime with a very confusing and boring arc. They should end this show with something like the ending of Kyoto Arc/Shishio Arc. Episode 61
you guys should see samurai x trust and betrayal shows how he came to be the greatest killer ever known even as a child.... and orgins of the first and second scar to form the x shape. sorry no reverse blade on this one lol he guts em..

forgot to add that episode 95 exists but was (at the time) only released to the dvd/vhs. Hopefully CR will be able to put it up.
they should have done a sequel or somethin...i feel like they left a big hole to the story
Rurouni Kenshin <3
It was a excellent show but now onto elsewhere to find the remaining episodes!!!!
Sano jumped 3 floor high..... that's some mad air time
Was this anime cancelled or something? So many questions left unanswered. What happened to Kaoru's Father? Who's Grave did Kenshin visit in Kyoto? Why didn't love ever blossom? How did Kenshin get his scar? Kenshin's past too.
* Kenshin's past as Shinta and once he left his Master. And I'm sure that Saito still had parts in the story to continue.
Excellent show. they definitely should add more. Feeling a huge void after that end
I like this anime (well I like many but not the point) and I feel it was really well made but at the end of the credits it says next time on Rurouni Kenshin so I think some episodes are missing or something
i ordered the OVA's from cr a couple weeks back, hope they get here soon
Nooooo it's over? cry cry
