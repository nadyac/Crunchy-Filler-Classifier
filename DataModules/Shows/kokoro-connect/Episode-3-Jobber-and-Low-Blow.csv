And he didn't even hold back on himself...he either REALLY likes this girl or he's a masochist.
Why not both?
I"D HVE TO WANT TO MARRY THE GIRL! No but seriously he won so many bro points. Amen to that brother he deserves everything he could want that week for doing something like that, but instead people are more suspicious of him.
@chaz1776. I think it was established in his earlier conversation with Inaba(?) that the guy is an A grade masochist!!
The cracking sound really was unnecessary and just made it more painful to watch. ;_;
She was in martial arts and didn't know that would hurt a guy?
Unless you were to damage the person's pelvis, the pain threshold wouldn't have ordinary limitations. There's no coup de grace effect or sudden lack of pain involved. It'll keep going until the body has somewhat recovered.
The sad fact is that a guy is absolutely aware of this and will be protective if the other person goes so far as to gesture a kick. But, hey, new false sense of security for her >.>
My ex saw me get kicked and asked me why I was in the fetal position
I was riding my bike down my street and hit a bump that I usually stood up for and I got hit in a... certain area. I fell off my bike and couldn't move for a minute. If that's anywhere close to how guys feel, I feel sorry for you.
For a minute? Try about 20, if you're lucky.
when i heard him say im gonna teach you something that works on all men i imediately knew what was going to happen.
jajaja ya I know right?
Just the lead up hurt D:
Just the thought hurt me xD
RIGHT GUYS! She'd kiss him! What no that isn't what happened.
I also immediately knew that they were gonna swap back almost immediately the blow was dealt!!Telegraphed that one!!

That took some BALLS... lol
Aw man... That was so hilarious, yet so touching! This show's gonna wreck my emotions, isn't it? The fact that I can tell so soon scares me... No show has hit me so early like this.
AH AHHH NO NOOO! Its soooo painful too watch!
PLEASE DON'T BE A HAREM OH GOD NO.
The show is really starting to live up to the potential of the concept.
"Jobber and a 'Low Blow' ", now I understand
A more descriptive episode title has never been written.
The fear of men is called androphobia. The fear of women is called gynophobia. The fear of Chuck Norris is called Common Sense.
If the cure to Androphobia is a kick to the balls, whats the cure for gynophobia?
TittyTwisters?
I'm worried about Iori Nagase. Her Mom asked her something... I have a bad feeling that the Mom asked her to move in with her Dad.


That's what I've heard referred to by a self-defense guy as a "totem." It's just as much of a totem as "I'll practice karate to protect myself." It brings comfort and overconfidence, but little else. Her problem isn't that simple

By definition, a phobia means your reaction is disproportionate and irrational. The best way to correct that is for her to review her actions mindfully and consciously and to socialize with boys in a controlled manner.
Real self-defense is based upon having an educated assessment of threats and having good habits. Her threat assessment is unrealistic and overtuned and her life strategies are dysfunctional as they are. A totem is no substitute.
Sorry, I mean, "talisman" not, "totem." A talisman is any sort of magic bullet solution that simplifies self defense problems to a simple cavalier, "I have my knife." Or "I'll just kick him in the balls."
I think everyone had something bad happen in there lives that's why he the myserious guy was like you all seem intresting. hopefully somebody agrees.
How did he recover so fast? If I took a hit like that I would be out of school for a week.
Androphobia seems like such a joke after watching Working!!
At least with this one, the androphobia has a better storyline reason than Working!! did. "Escaping from an attacker" is much more believable than "my dad scared me with stories of evil men".
Some shounen shows spoil shit in the episode by the title.
PAIN!! A real friend!
LOL. He low blow'd himself...
Destroyer of Balls.........
