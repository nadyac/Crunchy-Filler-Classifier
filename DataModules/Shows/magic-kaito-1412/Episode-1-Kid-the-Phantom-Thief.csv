Fanatastic New Year's gift CR!! Thanks for adding Magic Kaito 1412! Dramatic entrance as always Kid!
First episode certainly delivered!
The story looks to have potential, although the sharp facial features will take a little getting used to. They have some pretty sharp lines there.
Glad to see Magic Kaito on CR alongside Conan.
but people like the thief better, less filter.
Retro character designs are kinda fun once you get used to them. A worthy counterpart to Lupin III.
Something about this episode seems rather... fishy...
There sure are a lot of guys running around with capes & top-hats
i know right
the only thing that really bothers me is that giant pointy nose ._.
On the girl too.
me too it makes me laugh
better than usop is that how you spell it?
USOP!!! his mom too xD
It seems as though this anime is populated by rhino-people
Glad to see that CR picked this up after scoring Detective Conan!
Pinocchio noses, Pinocchio noses everywhere...
It's the art style its based of off. I'd say check out the manga but, as far as I know, it never was licensed (not that I don't own the Japanese).
Good god your avatar.
Kaito as a kid's voice is freaking annoying. Is he supposed to be the Japanese Pinocchio?
Lol I'm half expecting Kaito's nose to grow long and him to pull a slingshot out of his pocket yelling I'M CAPTAIN USOPP! Nice addition CR, too bad all the rest of the weekly shows weren't around.
there's a bunch that they have not available in the US for some reason.
He doesn't like fish? How the heck has he lived in Japan all this time with no one noticing?
Trick is to take a really long time to eat, so it looks like you're eating a lot, but you're not actually. At least, according to my parents (who very much dislike fish).
I can already tell this will be great.
Dat Engrish doe...
Reminds me of D.N. Angel lol.
wow his mom is SMOKIN HOT!

Anyone else tried to solve those integrals to see if they got them right? I got 2xy (no squared) and sqr(3) * x (no over 2).
Kaito and Kaito Kid. No one seems to match the names though he has dummies.
They're spelt differently in Japanese. Also the "Kaito" in "Kaito Kid" isn't a name, it's just the Japanese word for "Phantom Thief". If you met someone with the last name "Baker", you wouldn't assume they actually made bread for a living.
Good to see this, though if Kaito acted a little less like an ass I might cheer for him more...he should have listened to his dad about how to treat a lady. Or even Aoko!
MK!!!!! My life is complete.Time to rewatch everything!! <3
Yes!!!!!!
Kaito handling two women, solving math problems, and pulling off magic tricks all at the same time. My god, somebody stop him!
Did anyone else think of Desert Punk when he started flying in the beginning of the episode?
This is absolutely adorable ! <o0o>!
