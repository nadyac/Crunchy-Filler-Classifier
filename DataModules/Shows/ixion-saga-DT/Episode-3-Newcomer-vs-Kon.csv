Why do they think an animal in a hat and scarf is wild?
Yeah, I was expecting at least Kon to react on that.
Really? You're trying to seriously make sense out of this?
is show is fun ha ha ha
..... Hunter rank...Tinged meat....pitfall trap...barrel bomb....mega bug net.... He has been playing WAY too much Monster Hunter
Did you see the game he was plating before his dimensional transportation? It was Monster Hunter Frontier, the mmorpg thats japan and korean only.

Mariandale switching to a man voice when he saw the animal was priceless XD

It can't be... The voice actor... Keima? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
It is soooo weird hearing Zoro squeal because of a cute animal.
i wonder if this series has to have a nut related joke every episode?
I certainly hope so.

The Monster Hunter reference was perfect xD!
lololol i can't believe he lost both his balls hahaha
well least he has his balance back haha
Wow why you guys so mad? This was a funny episode!
Well, I don't think this is really filler. Just character introduction. The rodent looks important according to the OP and the end of episode 2. Funny but, I agree it was a little drawn out. They should have spent more time on Eric.
I think jokes about him not being lopsided anymore would have been more constructive.
ain't got the balls to do anything anymore I see.
At least he's not leaning to one side now.

Does the opening theme tick anybody else off? ._."
Does anyone else think the lama is the best character of the anime?
Little flying squirrel knows how to protect his nuts...
unlike Erec
if it has nuts, they never figured that one out.
it is a squirrel. Of course it has nuts.
i think it's time we make some killing... selling him viagra XD
wow why so much hate this show is very funny seriously some people just don't know good if they got hit by it
Or kicked in the nuts by it
I enjoyed the episode even though i cant understand why so many people hate it so their going to drop the entire series.
heh, not bad for a some low brow lulz. Sometimes need some of that to balance the "anime iz seruius buznuss" series.
