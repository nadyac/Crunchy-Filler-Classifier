truth no spoon this comment removed am 18 truth actually trying kill but spoon not his titan form just like tower druagafear spoon mightiest weapon all woman scares crap out lucky dos not want study 18 proud good episode liked built up ending music started those final minutes very exciting know pace can contentious but aot knows build strong moments opinion anyway so did cost half right leg but worth fight what believe right lotta respect here gotta admit would probably never join military im glad theres much more people braver than sir earned respect wanted join military but not wasnt super advanced like super suits no complimentary super suit need focus getting rich so can make own people who use term weeaboo general fucking moronic fuckwit troll fucks fuck off shit fucking hate term so much could go full epsiode nothing but hanji having her freakouts subverted by redshirt army nah think thats higher up rayray like maybe 114 something eren titan form help real heroes survey corps horses not get scared shitless panic immense vibrations giant can outrun punt like football crush like an ant takes real courage its probably intentional these horses obviously made specialized maneuver equipment no way any normal horses could gallop full speed over an hour over rough terrain without serious injury warhorses definition warhorse horse used war think mean not chargers makes sense endurance would more important than full gallop speed like steppe ponies used by mongols remember titans only eat humans dont know what more terrifying having titan chase looking those scary eyes discovering your stream didnt start subs always refresh because no subs every time ive led into ep countdown solve nosubs issue just right click select your language no need refresh friends were freakin hell out well not japanese friend understood what were saying am glad waited an hour after countdown so issue didnt affect wish issue fixed those experience here thought would more cool needed spoon transform oh god tick sppoooooonn would call him rusty spoonz his nickname should salad fingers least wasnt reaching spork would just plain undignified another great episode good character development eren levis group cant wait next one really know where place tobecontinued tobecontinued kills every time man wasnt titan enough her took eren while get big too must one helluva masochist selfinflicted pain gets him going oh spoons too grapefruit spoon squad levi fucking badass not only excellent fighters but proud disciplined well great people overall looked like most squads where given different orders different intel erens location makes sense its way see what squad team member might trader less levi squad knows more can trust guess not rude wasteu its traitor traders people who trade things yeah agree your comment wouldve cool lol would stupid wouldnt im pretty glad taking nice slow explaining things show means theres chance well get more seasons show isnt stretching anything out simply reordered most flashbacks 1st third show go chronologically other events flashback like others now being shown where originally were judging by manga show think will take long time catch up though already kinda theory what hell going real problem here monthly manga meaning about 12 episodes month isnt even close atm though so no worries theres no way series popular wont second season maybe will take big break let manga get further ahead though remember fatezero did something like its very likely too happen just hope dont stretch out too long but sweet spot stop an anime soooo hard do tt spoons can so dangerous sometimes mom only lets handle things sharper then knife no spoons #nospoon hanji does mean gendo oh god hate shetitan smiles gives chill thatll pretty big pillow colossal titan hug pillow already exists after all dont think its 60 meters though oh hope titan fetish doesnt become new thing too thatd just bit too stupidhow could one get off anyway reality would titan fd ya youd dead its like getting snoo snooed death futurama xd tooidioticcannot compute dies want pillow now who else bit themselves watching ep no whats so silly your comment yeah bit ittwice didnt even think but im going do now just because dont want only one who didnt do peer pressure this comment removed did just so could teeth marks way could look remember series forever no no dont end attack what doing attack stahp did stop careful what wish omg ur right cant even relate who else short blonde hair great physical skills do really need say dont knowi think its erens mom whatever his pops did him probably did his wife too this comment removed no cant his wife because erens mom wasnt blonde but know who im just not gonna spoil eren make sure pocket full spoons just incase waited days minute episode neeed moorreee yo its called character development episodes one prefer plot episodes myself well though least stuff actually happened flashback rather than just repeating stuff weve already seen some random filler chapter manga did flashback middle im liking following manga word word mhm like menace mentioned flashback pretty much dead chapter manga am really happy much keeping true funk dat such perfect adaptation manga could not squeezed more stuff without preview guess need those previews
