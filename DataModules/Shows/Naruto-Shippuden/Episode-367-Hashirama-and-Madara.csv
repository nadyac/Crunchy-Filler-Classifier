I liked the back story it shows the ravages of war and how it effects the young more then anything. This show's why they fought so hard and formed so many great jutsu jus for survival for the lose of so many loved ones.
I read the manga to keep ahead but there's nothing like watching epic fights animated. Or the the animated expressions you see on the characters. Like young Madara's stupid angry face xD A simple book panel/page can't compare to that.
Hashirama and Madara's back story are so amazing and moving! So sad that such great friends were born enemies of one another
Konoha settlement!
I agree w/Squijum25. The manga allows fans a much more detailed look at NS's world & character's inner thoughts, plus it's a fun read. NS's epic battles, particularly the 1on1 showdowns, are more exciting & profound to watch than read....
The epic fights are equal amount action/emotion+omg the feels. TalkNoJutsu isn't Naruto's bad - he's just good at it, every nin pulls it out when in a deathmatch w/BFF. This ep; lil'Hash such a troll!, lil'Mad a tsundere?, Tobi=Min's Daddy?
"Let me show you my Water Style"- Madara 2014
Water Style: Water Snake Jutsu.
I threw up a few different Jutsu signs and used the wind style to blow out my birthday cake candles one year..... It was pretty hardcore
kahahahah!!!!! Each boy in Naruto has an interesting side! Madara has an extended version!
I will never understand why some people think every flashback is a filler, besides most people would WANT to know more about the main antagonist and the first hokage regardless as to whether it's filler or not

I basically deem filler as something that wasn't in the original work. Filler, this was not. Alright, since most anime has a "beach episode" I guess that might count as a filler as well. lol
I think my IQ may have subsequently dropped a point or two by reading some of these comments..... if some moron misuses the word filler one more time I am ganna go /wrists (waiting for said moron to repeatedly type the word "filler" below)
I guess it all depends how the flashbacks are used. If they show something that has not been shown before, like this one, then it is not filler as it holds key events that relate to the present events in the story.
While flashbacks are important they should be kept to a minimum. As such these last so many episodes have been really flashback oriented, which makes it feel to some that they're fillers.
Look. If it's in the manga, IT IS NOT A FILLER. You are suppose to know this for the story! Fillers only work for character development or humor. This, is in the manga.

Lets get this straight, filler is anime only material that is meant to delay the anime from catching up to the manga, period. Manga is the source cannon, it can have Omakes or side stories, but these are not filler, as it waits for no one.
When anime and/or manga has something that isn't considered interesting or worth watching/reading by certain fans for whatever reasons, it does not mean it's filler if it's original materials, it just means they don't like or care for it.
No, this is not a filler. This actual story from the manga. And it's damn well done ^^
Mini Madara is pretty funny
Haha yea! The expression he made when he insulted Hashirama's clothes was hilarious!
O man the art in the ending was so cool

I believe the ending was composed by killer bee.
The music too.
@hatoruki It suddenly becomes much more enjoyable if I just imagine the ending is by Killer Bee. Amazing.
I just don't like that Neji wasn't there. He was one of my favorites from the original series. His death seemed kind of rushed....
Wait, so there was no episode last week, and now there won't be an episode on the 17th? I really hope there is a double episode soon...
You know if you look back we've only been getting Naruto 3 times a month for awhile now
62 chapters behind actually, but still, they are running through faster than I thought they would. Whatever happened to the dramatic 5 episode fights?

I am going to store up a few episodes before I watch again. <3
erm next week there will be back to back epsodes
Neji wasn't in the ending credits... so sad...
It is indeed sad and unfortunately the ending song is just as sad.... and by sad I mean its freakin terrible no way around it
I like how Hashirama just had to confirm that Madara couldn't take a leak if someone was standing behind him.
Quite a nice little episode. I very much enjoyed watching Hashirama and Madara just hanging out and being goofy, all the while dreaming about a better world.

it's a non-romantic romeo and juliet.
This same kind of scenario is currently happening in the Middle East
It's a yaoi just waiting to happen
Hey, father, I've finally got a friend, an- Kill him .........

I miss the times when they did not air for a week or 2 they would compensate by releasing a double episode the week after...
That doesn't happen now cause they are ridiculously close the mange at this point. Only reason they're not shoving more filler down our throats is that manga is coming to an end soon.
It's not Filler. It's PLOT! The Founding of Konoha-Gakure. I can see why most people would think it's filler though, what with the complete lack of action/battle scenes! But Filler has Nothing to do with the main storyline, but this does!
It's only filler if it aint in the manga. This is straight from the manga, verbatim. That's Canon. Besides its a darn good story if not the highlight of this arc, and probably the closest part of the series to the real world. War torn kids.
This episode was refreshing
Hashirama had two brothers and Madara had four siblings?I am shocked!!
Or maybe break it....
Shocking truth!!
i think visually it was one of the best in a while usually its just fighting but it had views of konohagakure
Funny thing is that this was the way our world was at one point as well. If they don't procreate at a fast enough speed eventually the human population would die out due to all the violence. Each adult needs to produce atleast 2 more adults
Some areas are still like that because further wars sent whatever achievements they made back to the stone age. Not to mention imperial division of land. I have hope for the future the world over, its a long process but were making progress
i wish bleach would get a episode 367
They said the anime is coming back after the manga ends. The manga is on its last arc so it should be back within a few months.
I wonder how long you've been waiting for that LOL
Honestly I thought they decided to end the anime at a horrible time. You know with what happens with Ichigo at the end of the final episode. It was just stupid to end the anime there.

According to the mangaka for Bleach, everything in the anime so far was basically a prequel. And the current/last arc in the manga is supposed to be pretty long. That's what Ichigo's voice actor said at Anime Expo.
Why are the Uchihas so dang gorgeous.
