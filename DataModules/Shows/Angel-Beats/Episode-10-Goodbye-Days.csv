T.T the feels
I was about to start crying, but then i slapped myself. repeatedly. My family was wondering what the hell was happening, but it was better than sobbing
lol family watches in terror as you slap yourself in front of the computer
this one actually made me cried... I missed my wife (she passed away 09/27/2011 & only 29 years old) I understand how she feel of not able able achievement (kidney failure). I'm her first boyfriend, first love, first husband... I'm glad.
That really sucks, just death is a sad thing. I always think "Why does death happen?" So many good people die because of it, hopefully your wife was a good person and lived a good life....
"Death is not just an end but also a new beginning" may you meet again with your wife in the afterlife and leave a wonderful smile :'( =
all my prayers and condolences. You sir have achieved something others can only covet and dream
You have my prayers too, dude. I don't know what happens after death, if anything at all, but I pray with all my heart you'll see her again someday, and that my prayer isn't just some well-wish or flight of fancy
I hope she found happiness in the next life whatever happens after death, i hope you can find happiness again as well.
Omg that ending with Hinata and Yui was the cutest thing ever.
In Yui's mind, at the end, it did. She was brought peace in the knowledge that Hinata cared for *who* she was enough that he'd look passed her handicap.
That was beautiful.
I'd like to believe that it is a future life of theirs after they leave that place and are reborn.
+de3tz "Even if I am reborn into another world, my only hope is that I can meet you again."

Manly tears were shed.
I'M NOT CRYING I AM JUST SWEATING FROM MY EYES OK
I'M NOT CRYING II AM JUST EXCRETING 100% FILTERED PEE VIA EYEBALLS
I blame the onions....
i ain't gonna hide it. this made me cry
I'm not crying, it just so happens to be raining, and some of it ran off my face and onto the keyboard.
Hinata...I guess he really isn't that way. Huh.
He could go both ways.
Best series to make a grown man cry.
oooh clannad i still find it hard not to cry when i rewatch it
clannad doll in her room
@Zurka i watched this before Anohana so you can flip that sentence for me T.T
Every time, and i didn't even tear up at TFIOS
Otonashi: "Why are you here by yourself?" Angel: "Because she didn't chase me." LOL so cute! But OMG that ending! Oh my....just wow. Very bittersweet.
damn onions .. T_T
There must be people cutting them in all the apartments in my building, and it's just coming in through the AC....yeah, that's it. That's gotta be it, right?
Stupid onion-cutting ninjas, flying around and making me cry...
I love it when TK talks English. It makes English sound so much cooler then it actually is.
i wish they would have kissed >.>
Yeah, I was surprised that didn't happen. You would think that would have been mixed in with her ultimate dream.

Didn't you pay attention to the song's lyrics though? ^_^
i couldn't see the song lyrics through my tears
I re-watched it, the second time paying attention to the song, and bawled twice a hard.
22:19 mistranslation should be "I'll carry the dream YOU shared with me" Might want to fix that.
oh you mean for the song

Man... I probably shouldn't have been watching this so late. I was bawlin'! T.T This show..... I think I'm going to give my heart a break before continuing. I was going to marathon this in one night, but that just can't happen now.
Did anyone else notice the Air TV and Clannad stuffed animals at 8:00?
For all those people whose life was somehow not what they truly wanted, or it was taken away from them before they had time to make their dreams come true... I hope there really is a place like this that gives them a chance to be happy...

This show should be called Onion-Beats because it makes everyone cry.
Damn Otonashi, how you gonna do T.K like that?
TK is so random! "I kiss you!" haha
i know right XD i cried at the ending tho.
That was so beautiful it was painful to watch. This is only one of 5 or so shows that have literally brought me to tears. Just for this one episode this show deserves all of my praise and respect.
