Start to one of the great fights in anime!
I agree!
If not the greatest.
This episode is just unforgettable.
Their noses are so pointy why don't they just fight with their noses?
Did you all catch that sneaky product placement from Saito for Japanese katana?
A VICTORY FOR WOMEN!
Well, there goes the liver .. Or possibly the right lung.
Saito schooled Kenshin but what does he want from Kenshin, to remain a manslayer forever and not change. This is all personal vendetta.


LOL @ Yahiko becoming the protagonist 10 years later comment hahaha, that was gold.
Saitou... soooo bad asss :3
no Kenshin, please don't die ): you're actually a role model to me even if you are just a fictional character
