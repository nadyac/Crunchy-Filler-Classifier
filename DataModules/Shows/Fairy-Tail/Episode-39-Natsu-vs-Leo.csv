I kinda wanted to see where Virgo was going with the rings and vaulting horse...
from her bikini obviously (cough cough vag cough cough)
@da1quincy I though out of her ass lol. I do wondered about that mayo, rings, and vaulting horse of how it have worked out.
maybe she had *mayo* and *horse* radish sause for onion *rings* hahahaha im such an idgit XD
They mayo has me stumped, but the ring and horse... Lucy would be suspended by the ring and lowered onto the horse. It's similar to a medieval torture where they put you on a horse and put weights on straps that then attach to your legs.

Protip: When you fight fire with fire against Natsu, you're going to get burned
is it something like Natsu can only eat other kinds of flames if hes empty of his own?
That, and the fact that since Leo has been sucking up Natsu's flames, there is actual fire for him to eat from the darkness.
@Floovenspuncker- Regular light flames he can eat. But if its black flames, then he has to deplete all of his own flames in order to eat the dark flames. Otherwise it wont mix well. He has done this one other time in Fairy Tail Series 1.
yh against the fame god dragon slayer
i mean, he ate that massive energy blast way back when. he said that he can eat other things it just exhausts him for like 2 weeks. i imagine not something solid like gajeel, but still... there have been times where it would have ended ther
Can this arc just end already please...pretty boring compared to the tournament
I rather watch Naruto fillers. I'm actually serious.
i agree with Wyv3m
This whole arc could have been avoided if they hadn't been morons and searched for that globe. Like... the whole time they are looking I was sitting there with my head in my hands...
Cobos80, They nearly always do this, "Hey the bad guys are trying to get something, we must get it first!", "Oh noes they stole it...again"
I agree with some people. The new designs and the concept at the beginning had so much potential even a large plot hole when capicorn knew lucy's dolls name desptie having no memory.... bad scripting wasted good chances =/
Happy101 : When you hear celestial voices singing..< join in and ad lib >: Omelet....Mackeral...Tempura...Aaah-men
Omelet..Mackerel..Temura..Raaamen.
Omelet....Mackeral...Tempura...Raaamen. Come to my shop, im the cat food shaman. Your a cat with wings? Well that aint too commen, but nothin's too weird for fairy tails lyrical lawman! I swear these ryhmes will keep comin, just like
Phintia's Damon! No one can stop all this genius from fallin', on to the page like a wordsmith brahmin!
That was the best part of this episode. When a Happy joke is the highlight of the episode, you know you are in a lamer arc.
I don't know Happy, Ophiuchus looks pretty tasty to me, if you catch my drift.
I demand tartaros now!

The anime is two arcs ahead, but I think they wanted to get close to, or end the Tartarus arc before moving on.

@FrozenKoalagaming confused, so the tartarus arc and the sun village arc are before this filler ?????????
I think he meant manga. Tartarus arc is near it's end. My guess after anime does Tartarus arc they will go on another break. Plus this arc isn't that bad, it has some good laughs and not all were "fillers". Aquarius will play a big part upc
does this mean no more mayo?
nooooo no more cliffhangers T.T
Isn't darkness just absence of light?
Or is light just the absence of darkness?
No. Photons, which are a particle, are received by the receptors in your eyes, then transmitted to the brain by the nervous system, where the brain interprets it as light. Without photons you have darkness. Darkness is the absence of light.
People just like to complain even when there is nothing to complain about.
So is that a complaint about nothing?
i personally like it .....man everyone acts like this is their first arc ....just take a break lol and wait
This 2 week wait for episode 40 is killing me!
"shhh! keep it down,Natsu!" "Im carefully observing Ophiuchus" "observing? how's that?" "I'm trying to decide whether I treat that serpent, like a fish or not!" "so which did you decide?" "she doesn't look tasty so I'm going with "snake"!"
Hahahaha! Cana called Erza immature! XD
Here you go anime friends 59JZEH8H4C9, NYFW93UZZ3D, 4P94SEPK35C, and 96YJQX65FC8. Enjoy!
why isnt there a new episode this week?
This arc was added to the title. The filler gives the audience a chance to catch their breath before the new are comes. The next are i can't wait to see. I will really cover a lot of the story. The tournament was just a warm up.
Only good thing about this arc is the opening theme. (which I love!)
And the ED ofc.
You can't be serious, I absolutely despise it. Even after so many episodes it still makes me cringe every single time.

I think it is more cliche than poetic. Not saying it isn't both.
Also... she might not be. Her chant is translates to something like "Great King Above All Stars". I think.
