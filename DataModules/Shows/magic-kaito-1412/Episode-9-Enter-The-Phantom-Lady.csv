Kaito definitely gets his smooth operating skills from his dad.
And going at "my pace" from his mom!
I think the smoothness is sewn into the costume, 'cause as soon as he takes it off to just be Kaito, he earns Aoko's tsun side twice over.

Kaito's parents' courtship was very brief but very intense.
Man, the creator of this anime must love cars! First, what looks like an Alfa Romeo 2600 Spyder that his dad own and now a Lotus 7 replica. Very nice!
Love the opening and ending!
That's one awesome family!!!

Eh? Where?
Right at the end of the teaser.
I love the opening and closing songs. <3
