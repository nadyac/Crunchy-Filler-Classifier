Yea, Sacchan, it was a poem -_-
C'mon Sachi.
Well the way he said it didn't help
Thats my life in a nutshell enough courage to spit out the words I just cant say them right. Yep I can relate
Stiff, stilted delivery. Like he was reciting something... oh, yeah, it was written in his pocket. Yep, sorry. It did seem like a poem, not a confession. Not to mention that he never actually said it. As bad as the MG in Girl's monthly.
Her reaction when he tries again seems like she actually caught on.
There must always be that one older sibling that just can't drive normally. lol xD
@Zensunni My sister totaled a Mercedes and a Triumph Spitfire before I was out of Elementary school xD
^^' Ahaha~~ That older sibling is just like me... I'm the oldest, with some serious driving issues and am just as directionally challenged... They're just like me and my little brother~! ... Not sure that's something to be proud of...
I'm the oldest... lol and I'm bad at driving ~rownn
Im the oldest by 8 years, 22 and i still ride my bike...
I just want to point out how clever the name for Touko's family's shop was. Yataglass would be pronounced "Yatagarasu", just like the bird spirit of divine intervention, and their sign even has the crow on it.
It's symbolic of the plot, which pertains to seeing and changing the future.
The Japanese do love their wordplay
Indeed they do! But it's just so great that the wordplay ended up being extremely relevant to the story.
I saw that and had to pause and run to the comments to see if anybody else noticed, thought it was so cute
It's good, but it would be sad if the whole glass blowing thing was built around that though.
I'm not the only one bothered by the fact that she doesn't use gloves while working, right...?
Gloves and goggles aren't moe.
I disagree. I like a working moe girl! adds character.
it's because safety equipment are for pansies.... and professionals.
And people who like their eyes
she would need some custom equipment, as normal goggles cant cover her eyes
Love hexagon?
It seems to me like Yuki is the only one breaking a potential perfect three pairs. This isn't Nagi no Asukara, PA Works animes have ended things well before
nagi no asukara was a cluster fux with the love sways...but still an awesome one to watch
Well, there is at least a four sided figure around Touko, with Kakeru, Yuki, and Sachi. Then there is a ray off of that to Yuna from Yuki and one off of Sachi to Hiro. I expect the only one that will not be unrequited is Kakeru x Touko,
Love tesseract.
ep needed more okikura and the turbulence he brings to the group.
I wanted another western staring contest
Pick up lines so smooth they're mistaken for professional poems. First World Players' Problems.
there is a reason behind all this up votes!! couldn't say it better myself.
someone is using multiple accounts to downvote everything on this page.. every single comment has dropped about 5-10 votes after I up vote them - that's pretty lame
Lots of lame people, but there are more cool ones
Poor guy, classic nice guy/beta syndrome. Do nice things for your girl after she's your girl, not before.
Thats gross. How about do nice things for the sake of nice things. If you do them with an ulterior motive than you're not even worthy of friendship.

Or it's just "friendship love."
At the rate this love octagon is forming, I wouldn't be surprised if it was Yuri.
he got friendzoned SO hard
He's so deep in the friendzone.
Srsly? ._. Are you guys srsly saying this in all seriousness? Friendzone doesn't exist, being friends with people is not a lesser way of being and no one has a right to romantic or sexual favour.
^ are YOU being for real? Lol
sounds like claudevl has friendzoned many people...
Touka learn like all of us who can, sometimes seeing the future isn't all it's cracked up to be....
This series always makes me hungry -- every episode seems to feature a delicious lunch or dinner! ^_^
I know right! I'd really love to try some yakisoba after this episode.
Was is chicken yakisoba, to continue the chicken-themed meals of the previous episodes??!
Right?! I want some pickled red ginger right now!
The creek they were at looked like the one from Myself; Yourself!
Holy crap, it does..
The background animators for PA Works oughta do some work for my council planners - their towns are always so goddamn picturesque!
I have this weird feeling that Yana-chan will end up with Kakeru? Or is that ending way too Nagi-Asu?? I'm split between Kakeru and Yuki as well. I can already hear my heart breaking 10 episodes later
ahahaha really funny some parts :s
I'd say Yuki got a glimpse of something good down by the creek.
Fan service was much stronger in this episode than I had ever expected from this series.
Yeah, he sure did take his time turning away.
yeah who needs to see the future when you can see nekkid babes.
"But it's someone I love". Yuri confirmed.
I was hoping for that.
*pauses* *goes to comments* "someone else actually caught on to that!"
lol i paused right after hearin that
[This comment has been removed]
It's the season of yuri.
"I like hiking alone." Okikura mysterious level over 9,000.
Tohka dropping the "You're a precious friend" line on Yukinari. Moment of silence for my brothers in the friend zone. *Bows head and raises brofist*
Or gets angry and jealous of whoever she does decide she likes. Mind you it can be tough to be that objective when you're that age - I never managed it and spent a long time angry for no good reason

What's with all these down votes? jeez. The friend zone is a slippery slope, even if you manage to get out of it, become a couple and then that doesn't work out... oh man, a whole other can of worms can open up. lol
There is a good reason many people have a policy of not turning friendships into romances!! The only time I made an exception to the rule was a total disaster, much to my eternal regret!!
@TriggerSad well, it is her fault, not that she dont like him, but she tried to interfere with something that was not her buisness what so ever, she fucked up and might break the group because of it.
I always bring a waterproof hairdryer with me when I fetch water in the mountains.
Leads to some sweet booty when used
Had to look up cordless hairdryers and found that only one exists and it's garbage. Still, it is funny that she actually kept it on her after unloading at the site.

I think she meant her heart.
