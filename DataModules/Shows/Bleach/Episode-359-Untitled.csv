That's some intense mental damage lmao! XD
skip to 05:08.
5 freaking minutes... OMG!!! They really know how to stretch it out, it's like they think there is a year between each episode and we need all this intro to remind us... insane...
. . . and 8 seconds. . .
Lol welcome to One Piece
One piece has no Ed or preview for the next week. So no, its nothing like one piece
one piece is far worse with intros for sure
I dont want this anime to end T_T

I want to see Ishida arrive. He's got the strongest mind, and is too solo a person to accept Tsukushima always being by his side; I bet his arrival will make things more interesting.

isheda's dad isnt dead you mean his gandpr if i was the bookmark guy to get to him i would use ither orihime ichgo or rukia
Damn, how would you react if everyone you knew thought you were crazy?
Same
same here to
now, how would chuck norris react?... =w=
I'd walk calmly up to the dude saying "I'm sorry Shu." When I got there I'd place my hand on his shoulder. Look into his eyes and smile. Then I'd slide my hand over and rip is throat out in front of everyone. Can't heal the dead.
i would walk and put my hand on shu say i am sorry and ask if i could walk him to his car if he drove one and when he and i got to it and there's no one near use i would destroy his body from the atom out lol and then walk back in calmly
Lol at flashbacks. Tsukishima just sitting at all the important parts like a boss just like, "Yo, What's up?" No different clothes, no injuries or dirt or anything xD
You would at least think Yuzu and Karin would know something was up if Ichigo would attack someone. But than again he did replace everyones memories with him.
He didn't replace..he manipulated them.
well is sounds the same..because if something is replaced u will think that is true

From next episode it will be : Bleach Adventurers of Tsukishima
This is good and stupid all at the same time. Why would Ichigo run around lost and go with Ginjo to his safehouse. The safest damn place he knows is Urehara's shop. Just because he lost his powers doesn't mean he can't go there. BAKA!
Daaaang. Ichigo never lets go. He would still remember that Urahara question? XD Ichigo may not be a coward in brute battles, but.. Peer pressure and emotions? He can be turned to insanity so easily xD
He could've been on his way there.
@T0onLink... yes, he would make a powerful sith...
urehara probably knows ginjo
hes also suspicious of Urahara
Tsukishima such a bastard....
How can anyone know but Ichigo that Tsukichima was there with during the Ichigo vs. Aizen battle. Chad and Orihime were stuck in Hecco Mundo.
Also, Orihime fought her first demon solo. Tatsuki was under the Hollow's control, remember?
Lol so she cant learn afterwards? I remembered they all arrived after ichigo defeated aizen.
This is really pissing me off.
Those flashbacks were so funny, looked so fake and reall at the same time lol xD
mayb tsukishima just wants more friends...hes so misunderstood.
OH NO, HE GOT YOU TOO D:
Where are Kesuke, Isshin, and Uryu?
LOL @ the flashbacks. Everyone's all bleeding and tired and Tsukishima was just standing there like a boss.
The flash backs with Tsukishimaa added is like really weird like copy nd pasted weird
LOL, Tsukishima got lazy! XD
Make matters worse, he was reading a book each time. If I were involved in any one of those fights, I couldn't possibly have that expression.
photoshop
what happen to kon annyway
Hate how the first 5 minutes was from the last episode..
Anytime something good happens in an anime, they always do that to recap...also considering they are trying to get people into the anime, so they kind of HAVE to...
how come they cut off grimjow's arm in the anime but not tsukishima? Pretty lame. Makes ichigo look weak.

Studio Pierrot and Noriyuki Abe have done one hell of a job adapting this arc from the manga! Get ready for next week's episode guys. Shit's about to get REAL!
