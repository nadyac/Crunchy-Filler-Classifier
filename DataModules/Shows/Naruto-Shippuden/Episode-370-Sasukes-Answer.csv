"Oh what a coincidence, me too" I can't, I'm done.
I near died at that.
I love this! Orochimaru turns to be a good guy?? I just love him from the start!! I'm so touched that 4th hokage gonna see naruto become a hero. Waiting to see the hokages kick some asses. There isn't a single villian I can hate in Naruto.
Apart from Danzo
i would not call Orochimaru a good guy, he probebly killed hundreds of people. and done unspeakable experiments on more. he is a monster, but he is good at wot he does and atm they could use a monster. kill him after this event tho, allot.
He said that he was inside Kabuto :/

I got about an hour and a half of homework, then work at 7:30 in the morning then go straight to class... It's 1:30 now.. I'm not gonna stop watching though, XD
i have midterm tomorrow but meh ....naruto comes first
lol
Final exams are in weeks, but meh, Naruto comes first.
that ending holy shit 1 more week -_-
i loved the kakashi arc, though a lot of it was repetition, it was great to finally get an understanding of his background and toby.
I swear to god if you people continue to spew nonsense about what is or is not filler, I am going to shove a swivel stick STRAIT UP your peehole...... Thank you
lthunder2004 he did fail his younger brother really it was naruto and kabuto who did it kabuto by summoning itachi from the dead and naruto for changing itachis heart in the battle againist nagato
1 week? sadly no. Only thing I want to see is Minato appearing on the battlefield with Sasuke's hand on his shoulder... "Do-chan? SASUKE-KUN?!?"
This whole show is a filler because it's taking your time out of daily activities.
Flying Raijin Jutsu! Mwa ha Ha. We moved 30 feet. . .
Standing on your own face sounds both dramatic and painful at the same time...
Who wouldn't want to stand on a giant carving of their own face and strike an epic pose while shouting something cool like "Onward to the Battle!" ? I'm pretty sure i'd crash instagram with pictures if I had a giant statue.
The guy wears a coat that says fourth hokage on it, yea I think he is the type to stand on his face to be like yeah that and this is me....BAM
Now I'm imagining hokages, particularly the 1st and the 4th, taking selfies from their statues and acting dumb while the 2nd and 3rd just sigh in disbelief.
^I would pay to see that.

About Naruto has 2 wive Sakura and Hinata? Is that working? Good idea and no argue! =D
no, just no
We might find out who he ends up with in the new Naruto movie this fall The Last: Naruto the movie which shows a more older mature Naruto. If they don't resolve this issue in the anime or manga then they can do it in the movie.

So if i stab sasuke with me dick, will he love me?
Are you pouting Orochimaru?
[This comment has been removed]
Poor Orochi </3
who says hes not?
He always has been a tad bit emotional. (He just wanted to admit it.)
It was only cuz 3rd Hokage was there! <3 I'm starting to like Orochimaru more and more lol
Karin: Sasuke had the gall to stab me... Orochimaru: What a coincidence, Me too. Me: LOL !!!
karin is so freaking annoying lol
What else was funny, I think, is that Orochimaru was so willing/obidient to help, and he told Karin, you help too. It's like he went from super evil, to super good...
lmao heyskylin, I just realized how funny that is
Itachi flashbacks = instant tears
I would have packed a lunch if I knew I was going on a feeltrip....
i wish they didnt show these itachi flashbacks. they have shown these flashbacks at least 10 times. they could have covered more fighting if they did not show these flashbacks
They show all of these flashbacks because sometimes they're aired on television independently. The audience (who may or may not have watched the rest of the episodes) still needs to know what's going on.
I don't believe the flashbacks are shown in order to remind the viewers of what happened. They simply show what goes on in the character's head and how his/her past experiences influence his/her decisions. They add to the dramatic effect.

Hashirama: "Alright men, the biggest war this world has ever seen is going on right now! It's outcome, will change the shinobi world as we know it! Many people are dying as we speak! But before we go.... LETS TAKE MOUNTAIN-FACE SELFIES!!!"
And tobirama was obviously thinking: Oh my good, not again... Just stop the speeches already...

wut

Well if you take out the flashbacks, slayer697 kind of has a point. But then again, Sasuke couldn't have known which way to go... Itachi kills everyone... Village made him do it... Itachi did it for village... it just got though to him.
@football_star, No. Itachi sacrificed his clan and love his village. That's why he stopped his family and clan people, it's sad situation. He asked his Hokage a favor before he left from his village. If he on his clan side, it's horrible.
i doubt orochimaru is completely good.. probably has some ulterior motives
@Lthunder Those comments were meant as Sasuke's point of view from the information he has been led to believe as the story goes on.

"after being inside Kabuto..." umm....
you sir made me laugh
Kabuto wanted that big white snake inside him so much...
Orochimaru, After thrusting himself deep into Kabuto, came....... to a realization that he wanted to help a young boy. With his skin completely covered in a white substance, he decided to wait to forcibly take this boys body. A noble quest.
@ MatthewGade That is just wrong, LMAO funny, but very very wrong.
I'm surprised that the Hokages didn't even react to the fact that Danzo was killed by Sauske. Despite how evil he turned out, Danzo *was* Hashirama and Tobirama's apprentice and Hiruzen's childhood friend.
nobody pointed this out yet, but they probably weren't shocked about danzo because 1) the 3rd was the only personal friend 2) danzo tried to kill him and become hokage(failed) and 3) Sasuke was on the verge of using them to destroy the leaf
and 4) Danzo was a dick! Can that not be said enough!?! You're not nice one second and a dick the next. It takes time. There had to be signs.
Danzo wasn't nearly as powerful when the First and Second were around, and he definitely didn't have his Sharingan arm. They have no idea what Danzo was capable of, so they wouldn't really be surprised.
I guess hokages surprised because they feels like Danzo died finally! I guess
I don't know that they would be surprised, but Hiruzen and maybe Tobirama should've been a little sadder. Yeah Danzo was a dick, but Hiruzen forgave his own assassination attempt, and Tobirama only knew Danzo as an ambitious kid.
My kids will have kids before the anime ends hey at least they will witness a great anime.
Well, from what has been said the manga will be ending this year. So, we'll probably have another year or two at the most for the anime.
maybe his daughter is already pregnant? haha
What?! Your trying to tell me grandparents will walk the earth before this show ends?! I don't believe you.......
Does Sasuke really think "Sorry" cuts it for stabbing someone?
You people act like this is her first stabbing.
In Sasukes defense he was probably blinded by rage at all the mess danzo caused for him, Itachi and the Uchihas, not to mention the sharingans danzo had on his arm.
That's most definitely true, but that's really no excuse for trying to kill her.
Is black out excusing?
wasn't she just a tool for him to get vengeance? With the job done you get rid of the tools ya dont need anymore. he chose to break the tool. Perhaps would have been funnier if she and Sakura were to say "duel" over him? anyone? maybe? Ok..
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 4 Hokage ah ah ah
So...basically with that Flying Raijin Jutsu all they did was....jump down? Such skill. Much jump. Wow.
Huh, is that teleport? Wait a minute... Didn't 4th Hokage said "Yellow Flash Justu?
This show has been blowing my mind recently. The Sasuke / Itachi storyline is now my favourite of all anime.
A very sad story about an orphan who struggles with his misfortune and only finds darkness within. He envies that Naruto also struggles but finds enlightenment. That drives him further down, wanting to destroy his rival. 370 episodes worth?
This series is told from multiple POV's. You get some of everyone's view.
That's what I love most about it
Sasukes first day of school pov "hi my name is Sasuke and I don't have any family except my brother because he killed them all... oh and can you not invite me to play "tag" anymore? we ARE at ninja school to learn to kill ppl right?"
Between Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, I still think the Zabuza had just as much if not more feels and did it in less episodes.
Orochimaru got jokes
WHY DO THESE HAVE TO BE 30 MIN????? I WANT LIKE 2 HOURS T.T
Thanks MXDSHAAZYJM
The ending was amazing. Loved seeing all the Hokage together on their stone faces and listening to Minato talking about meeting Naruto again. The next few episodes are going to be badass.
few? Every episode will be action packed now!
Yeah, but the awesomeness is going to be more powerful in the next few eps!
Not ALL the Hokage were there. One is missing.
Meanwhile Tsunade is splitted in half...
