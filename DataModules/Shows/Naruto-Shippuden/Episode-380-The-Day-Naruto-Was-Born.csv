i meant part 1 orochimaru
don't you know... obito is "the coolest guy ever"
Orochimaru is my favorite villain... That's it. Why you may ask? He's a snake. Snakes are evil. That's it.
Orochimaru is one of my favorites too, I don't understand why someone disliked your comment though, it's as if we can't have a opinion when it's something like "Danzo is the best ever!" although I hate his guts lmao
So just saw a Susano'o riding the nine tailed fox while shooting amaterasu arrows.......all right then
Not really, there's only one real spoiler with the cloaks. They left out all the important stuff with Madara.
Sasuke riding Naruto? I thought there "kiss" was an accident. Well, at least know we can be clear on who's pitching and who's catching. Both of them ignoring girls madly in love with them just couldn't be coincidence. Finally some closure!
.... logic?
I lol'd
02:22 He's not that newborn 'BABE' anymore. xD
Holy shit, this opening might just be my favorite, as good as all the rest are. That was awesome.

You can definitely tell their summing this series up, going all neon and sh*t in that opening..
It was a great OP, the animation was perfect
I like how it basically is the show's last hurrah and we are looking back at this 10 year journey we took together with him, watching him grow up into the man he is now.
This is eye candy.
Ending got me all chocked up. Gawwdamn
damnt now im sad its ending.....srysly ive been watching since i got into anime

Man I wished I got into Naruto a lot sooner, I would of loved it so much as a child seeing as I started watching this a year ago and just loved it. imagine being a child and watching it ;_; Naruto has the best feels ever man the best
wait so naruto only has half the power of kurama
It gets me every single time T-T
Yep, Jiraiya and Tsunade, the 3 Prohibitions personified.
Include orochimaru in it yep those three are the 3 prohibitions themselves
Orochimaru? What did he have to do with gambling, drinking, or loose women?
Hunting on children?
Second Hokage is like: these father and son fuckers steal my Jutsus and call them theirs. I will create copyright laws in naruto universe.
I just about died from laughter reading that comment! XD
Naruto: will you bump fists with me,dad?.... That was just beautiful
narutos initial fistbump with kurama was even more epic
Is it just me, or was I the only expecting and somewhat still am expecting Kurama to have flashbacks of the things he's done to Naruto and try to apologize, then to be baffled when Naruto (almost definitely) forgives him without hesitation?
oh yea ur right lol that didnt occur to me
Kurama will never EVER apologize for his actions because he is what he is- Like the HULK= a force of Nature. He literally is still *hate* personified of all chakra balled up into forming him, He just been more trusting to caring people now
he was going berserk at that time, and being controlled so. ya i agree with him ^
Awesome opening!
Not sure what to think of that statement with a profile pic like that...

How is this a spoiler? Everyone with the slightest guessing abilities can think he gets smarter, I mean, he's like 18 now (in actual show time).
Not everyone watches from the start of the show. I'm talking about new people like myself who got into anime recently because of Naruto. I didn't, but other people might skip.
Skipping Naruto is like skipping the milk in cereal; you get the taste of the flakes, but you don't get the extra special taste it gets when adding milk (extra special taste = the feels in Naruto).
Happy 600th to the best show known to mankind!!! With many more episodes to come hopefully!!!~ **(^O^)**
If they do more fillers, it may carry into 2016. We'll see.
lol i wish they would add on to the actual storyline/enhance the fights... it would be nice to see more of that. for example, the madara/hashirama fight scenes in the previous episode were not in the manga, but were an excellent addition
Well, it depends on who's reading it; 10 minutes to one person could be more like 5 and 20 to another.
i guess but this episode got way less done than the previous few episodes thats for sure
Estimated end time for Naruto if they keep it up the way they are: End of 2015 or early 2016.
Brb gotta go wipe my tears and hug my parents.

IKR....they played that goddamn scene again. I am tired of crying all day today. (Just got done with Marineford in One Piece)....i feel like a pregnant woman.
lololol they always play the same scenes over and over again
@sinasalehi I cried a lot during the Marineford Arc too! It's so emotional doe! ^o^ Like the part where Coby screamed to the navy about how merciless they are. He was not alone in the crying department on that part, let's just say that lol
@Jakeal03 dude i cried like a bitch during Marineford....no movie/tvshow/anime has ever done that to me. Only thing that came close is that scene at the end of this episode, but when they originally played it....that whole episode.
In this episode tobirama is 2 % tsun 98 % dere
Not the only -rama to whom that applies.
What are you doing making me tear up again God this is a great show. Cant wait for next week.
Those damn ninjas cutting up onions...
I thought a sec that kushina would give him the sex talk too but o well
It's a good thing Naruto was standing to the left of Minato. That would have been quite awkward otherwise.

Noooo, that intro is so full of spoilers >_<
The last intro did the same thing lol
yep it showed everything smh as if everyone reads the manga lol

isn't that what the opening suppose to do? show you whats to come in the next arc of the story? i mean look at other animes... and if you really think about it. first opening to any anime is spoilers.... I like it this way...
@SorinKouhai Finally, a sensible point! I think every opening except the extremely metaphorical ones like OP8 spoils stuff about the upcoming arc if you think about it. It wouldn't be cool if they only had metaphorical openings
new opening song? CINEMATIC OWNS song is decent LETS GOOO!!!
I can understand why people like the opening "GO!!!", but it was personally one of my least favorite from the series; I mean, wasn't he training with Jiraiha (not sure how to spell name) to master the Rasengan? It seems unfitting for theArc
its called fighting dreamers
No it's not, the name of the song is "GO" by flow. I still don't understand why people think it's called fighting dreamers even though it would have been a decent name for the song as well.
@Soultaker78 Probably because the phrase is in the first english lyrics of the song and sticks out to the people who are too lazy and/or uninterested to look up the actual name of the song lol ^.^
this the second longest anime running and is one of the best
Well, this is the 2nd longest running anime in the sense that it doesn't seperate from the main story; while Ash in Pokemon tries to catch 'em all, and by catch 'em all, I mean catch like 80/700-ish, it still takes him six different (cont.)
(cont.) regions and six different series to cover it, and they don't seem to follow a main story, just a main goal.
Why did i get downvoted for saying that i0un forgot about the anime One Piece? It has been running for longer than Naruto.
@nusser17 people are faggots
@Bojangles4th It's called having arcs, Naruto has them too, most shows have them.
This opening is pretty much saying "Yo I just want to remind y'all that the show is about to end"
Omg i was thinking the same thing!!! smart man
Goddamn ninjas cutting up onions in front of me! QAQ
Not once but twice this episode.. damn them ninjas with their onions.
