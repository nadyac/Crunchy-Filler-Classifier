I love how even the theme songs forgot about yamato now

Lol I know! I hope he's alright, I freakin love him! XD
if they follow the manga then hes fine
He's going to come back and kill everyone for forgetting about him.
I really wonder what will happen when Harashima realizes his cells have been put everywhere!
I want Kakashi to come back and be like WTF? Sasuke? Hokages? Oro-kun? Big giant-ass tree? Obito being a badass? Like what? Also: 6GLGR5RLQZG
I know! XD I love this fight so far, this is the first ever anime fight to make me go like "Oh my god! There's no fuckin' way the good guys can win this! :O"

Bojangles4th, you really made me want to watch Naruto from the beginning with your comment.
Anyone else wish Jiraya was here? ;_;
Well, I'm sure we'll see him by the end. Probably talking to Minato on the other side.
I don't think Jiraya would be of a lot of help here. He would probably be on the same level as Tsunade and Orochimaru, and Naruto could kick their butts if he so desired. Though he would be very good encouragement for Naruto.
It's like this, around %80 of Jiraiya's screen-time is during filler episodes... Unfortunately.
Jiraya is a Sage Ninja. He knows tons of techniques that Naruto don't even know exists. If he were still around, he'd be giving Obito a VERY HARD TIME on the battlefield.
But even the sage toad admitted Naruto surpassed Jiraya
Damn that ending.... just makes me want to see next week's episode even more QQ

Hey, it's not like I'm claiming it's better or anything you people act like I ruined your day because I referenced another anime that's also popular.
I still prefer Naruto over Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z any day; even though I still like Dragon Ball Z *and* it was my first anime (aside from Pokemon, but I don't count that).
@Bojangles4th DBZ was my first anime too, but I like Naruto more :3
I love that Kurama is zipped up like a onesie in the back. Fits Naruto's personality perfectly.
Can't get tired of this Opening, has to be one of the best.
Obviously, some of you are forgetting OP 5, 8, and of course 11.
This has the best scenes and images (art, whatever you want to call it) and the song matches so well. It's all about the eyes y'all. This is scores better than the last one!
Kyuubi and Susano'o fusion!
I would even argue this op is better than the universally agreed No. 1 Naruto op, Sign by flow. Only just better though.
Discussing the older OP's and ED's takes me back. Yama no yoni mieruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
One of the best episodes yet, can't wait for next week's episode! 9 tails in susanoo mode!
Seriously, one of the best episodes yet? Did you not notice that they are basically repeating the same cycle over and over (heroes are beaten, heroes say something inspirational, heros start fighting, rinse, repeat)?
Im gonna miss this anime so much.... Remember everyone to fully enjoying this!
I'm seeing Naruto lasting maybe another year if that.
A year or less sounds about right. After Obito there's only two more major fights left and the next one is kinda short. Although, that next fight is Guy-heavy so I'm excited.
Except FMA Brotherhood wasn't a remake, it's based off of the actual manga. The first series of FMA was created with only using the first few chapters or so of the manga since the manga wasn't completed.
I hope they do a Naruto "Kia" kinda deal. Rather than a Brotherhood remake. I just don't want to wait ten years for "Kia" (or would it be called "Chakra"....lame). So I'll take whatever comes first, in hopes they do both.
The anime still has a solid 2 years if production keeps the same pace. But who knows; they could pull a Star Wars: The Clone Wars and start airing two or three episodes at a time so it can end with the manga sooner.
"I'm sorry Dad, I can't join you yet". I smiled at this scene.
I cried lol
always the quickest 20 minutes of my life
Me: YESS! #NarutoThursdays! *20 mins of watching* "Well, it's a good thing this is the half-point of the epi-" *credits start playing* "N-N-NOOO!!!" If you get into this show, it'll redefine "time flies" ;^;
Damn Kakashi, you're missing out on the action and why did it take you so long to stitch?! BE HAPPY MY PRETTYS: XDBGFGZSKHL YMMRVCREDBC
Yep Naruto and Sauske stupidly powerful on there own, when they get around to working together, well lets just say it makes there allies smile and the enemies in a continuous state of WTF?
I don't care what anyone says, it seems like every ep for a while now has been like a reward of sorts for sticking it out thru all the good & bad filler, the flashbacks - & anything else ppl hate on Naruto for - for the last 603 episodes.
Why did this feel like I was watching someone play Dynasty Warriors.
Dynasty Warriors: Naruto...I'd play that.
lol all 6 games of it

Am I missing something or shouldnt the old Earth guy just be able to Dust style the tree essentially "cutting" it down...I mean if Orochimarus snakes work in holding it back shouldnt his jutsu work?
Plot holes everywhere
He could use his kekkei genkai (particle style) but he is still prob pretty wrecked from the fight with Madara. Besides, he hasnt even reached the tree yet. Im sure you will see soon as they get close enough to try and cut it down.
I'm guessing the tree trunk is way bigger than the cube he can make with his particle style, so he'd just take a little chunk out of it.
That moment when you realize Pain had the ability to use all 5 elements at once, just like SOSP Obito right now; he used the 5 elements at once when forming the rods that restrained Naruto.

So at the VERY beginning I though Kiba was cool. Then I realized how wrong I was, so I switched over to Team Shikamaru. And this episode might have been the best Shika-minded episode (At least top 5, probably top 3)
Ummmm so when is Yamato coming back?

What if: The Nine-Tails is leeched from Naruto by the tree.
Why can't Naruto episodes be like an hour long
One? Why not have two? Or three? It's ok, this show makes time fly by so fast, you'll forget you had a pet and it'll starve to death.
