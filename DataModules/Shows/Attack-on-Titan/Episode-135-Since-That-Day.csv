On the bright side, if this is being counted as 13.5 then at least it's not being wasted as one of the 24 eps, so you're still getting 24 eps + recap.
Who needs a recap if I binge watched the 13 episodes in like a day
[This comment has been removed]
with this theory i believe that the father or someone who opposes the law to leave the walls (or armins parents cuz of the first subtle line my parents who went outside of the walls which we never hear from again) are the special titans

I'm just remembering the fact that Mikasa had nice long hair before, and cut it off cuz Eren said she should.
AoT cosplayers actually outnumbered Super Mario, One Piece and Naruto this weekend @ Anime Expo LA. Is that a good thing or... wutevz, looking fwd to ep 14 .
Weird, I know this is a recap episode, but them showing us Eren dreaming about the events to come mean anything. It made me wonder, why was he lying on the grass under the tree when they were supposed to be working? And why was he crying?
I have seen a show do that before and it wasn't even good to begin with yet it still made me mad. You instantly destroy the whole story you built. As an amateur author, that pisses me off. They best not do that on this anime.
Eren WAS having a very strange, almost foresightful dream the first day, when Mikasa found him. He started crying. I don't think this is all a dream, but I do wonder if Eren has some foresight, or just tunes into the Titan's sometimes.

or you could all just realize that perhaps the staff just made a recap video that had nothing to do with the arc in any manner, but to highlight some awesomeness. I think we are reading way to far into this.
I believe Eren was crying because his memories of the injection and that guy's speech.
I wonder why armin is always narrating. maybe that will mean something in the end....
@drake: Why say something so confidently when you have no idea what you're talking about? They DO show reruns on Japanese TV all the time. You don't see it because fansubbing groups aren't going to resub and release repeats of old shows.
lol I never noticed that voice to be Armin's
record japan record
@Sarashi_and_Spats: Actually, drake does have an idea of what he's talking about, because they don't show reruns of anime on Japanese TV. They may show the same episode more than once in one day, but they don't rerun a whole season.
it wont load WHY
holy shit was he dreaming about the future in the 1st episode?????

I swear if there is a Stein's;Gate Timeloop aspect i would cry with frustration, and joy at the same time.
I think while he was in that jail cell he just had a flashback dream about waking up in the 1st ep with Mikasa standing over him. At least thats what I want to believe.
oh yay timey wimey wibbly wobbly stuff... i really hope that isn't the case D:
@nfinch1992: Nice one on the Doctor Who reference, but it's Wibbly Wobbly, Timey Wimey...stuff. XD
the soundtracks make this anime so much better.
Although it's probably not the case, I'd like to think they added the kickass music to this recap after reading the comments on Crunchy Roll regarding how much everyone liked the song in the last episode
I doubt that crunchyroll had anything to do with that. Most of the time these episodes are planned way in advance. In any case, they're definitely getting my 5 stars for doing such a great job.
If you've payed attention the last few eps you'll realize just how important this episode is for the staff. I've caught a few scenes with missed cell coloring etc. A series of this high quality isn't done overnight.
Thank you, good lord. This series is getting an absurd amount of effort thrown at it for a spring series. People gotta understand that this stuff takes time and finagling.
At the Production IG panel at Anime Expo LA yesterday, someone asked the president if the errors were due to time or budget limitations, and to elaborate: his one word response: "Ryouhou" (both). Way to kill a troll, Shachou-san!
This isn't to take pressure off the anime staff, it's to stop the anime catching up with the manga. Like how Naruto got a year of filler and why so many adapted anime have terrible pacing, especially as they go on - like DBZ and One Piece.
I'd say it has multiple purposes rather than just one.
@Sarashi_and_Spats: I haven't read the manga for AoT yet, but from my understanding from other people's comments on here, it only comes out monthly. One recap episode in the middle of the series isn't going to slow it down much.
Since that day Eren has been sleeping.
Well at least with no new footage and etc, we can hear the best songs on the ost.
Those were my thoughts exactly. As I love the soundtrack to the series, I can at least appreciate being treated to some good tracks.
watching this right after listening to Gundam Unicorn OST. Hiroyuki Sawano, you evil genius.
good music helps it all ways
I have the full soundtrack and I have to say its just one of those badass soundtracks you listen to repeatedly lol I believe it has the same people who did the guilty crown soundtrack if im not mistaken but its not quite as epic.
A recap episode is also for Japanese audiences that do not have the luxury of watching the anime on services like crunchyroll, and must watch the anime on network TV. Some may have missed the beginning of the story.
Good point! We're actually privileged to be able to re-watch it, since the Japanese audience can't.
You can stream anime on niconico in Japan.
Isn't that only for a limited time though? I remember watching Black Rock Shooter on niconico and older episodes got removed once the new ones aired. Don't know if it changed since them though.
A recap episode for people who don't pay attention during the first 2 minutes of every episode.
It was still good episode.
nice one
I guess if you're in Japan and only get the opportunity to view the first run episodes and you can't record them this episode is heaven sent. We're lucky, we can just re-watch them all at our leisure. Still cool to reflect on the past eps
People in Japan can download episodes off the internet just like we can. This is more to get new viewers into it. People that are already into it are perfectly capable of going on a torrent site and downloading the series to recap that way.
If nothing else, this gives us one more chance to enjoy that amazing opening before the new ones starts playing in episode 14.
LOL at the preview mikasa is scary~~~ Dont understand why he is being treated as a criminal though when he was the one that just plugged the hole
Yes, but didn't they already cover that in the last few episodes? Now it seems like they're just going back and forth between trusting him, not trusting him, trusting him, not trusting him.
tdbgamer, besides the point about him losing control once, which at this point only a few people in charge even know, this is how the human race reacts to everything. Fear takes control and people do stupid stuff.
He's in the Survey Corps special yaoi dungeon. You do NOT want to know what happens in there - or perhaps you do?
you guys did see the note in the last episode that said titans showed up 107 years ago right?
I don't think it's that they keep changing from trusting him to not trusting him, more like there are an enormous number of people...some are willing to take the chance, the others are terrified of him.
All of you are complaining about one Recap episode and sound stupid like they just finished an entire arc, a 10 part Battle, most anime go on a whole filler arc after completing an arc. quit complaining about ONE recap.

They're short on staff. They even said that they thought this wasn't going to be big but when it did, they were pretty amazed. They want to give the show everything they got. With the recap, they're able to work on the new ep much longer =)
You could make the DBZ comparison if most of the episodes were people standing around doing jack all (I like DBZ, but damn there was a lot of filler like that...let's talk about this for a whole episode, then have five of Goku powering up)
considering how the story jumped a lot in the first 13 eps, this episode wasn't too bad. plus some good music and a fresh perspective of what has happened doesn't hurt.
I bid my farewell to the most epic, energizing opening the industry has seen in a while. I can only hope the new OP we'll get rivals the first one in awesomeness. And goodbye to the great ending too, which was sadly overshadowed by the OP.
Considering I have re-watched every episode like 10 times already, this wasn't fun for me....
same here >:c *sigh
It was fun for me. It actually prevented me from rewatching the series a third time. Let's see how long I can continue without rewatching xD
lol ohh well funny comments XD
So this is what it's like without internal monologues and flashbacks. It actually all fits in 20 min.
i think they did an amazing job of making the story flow with this recap
i like how it doesnt show you this is uploaded.. you have to guess
Well usually it comes every saturday .. i guess they didn't make it a big deal since its just an in-between recap episode instead of a whole new one
Every Saturday 7:00PM EST. Translate that to what ever time zone you have, remember episodes might also have delays like this one.
It was on the Crunchyroll RSS feed so maybe you could subscribe to that?
