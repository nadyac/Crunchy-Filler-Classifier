that little guy showed some style this ep and kept the fort dowm while they were gone good ep.
Misao: "What is it?" Kaoru: "Something is approaching." Okina: "Something that is tremendously large..." Me: "Its Godzilla!"
I guess the henchmen were just there for decoration.
Love the music and sounds in this anime...
Shishiio's pet Titan
Awesome episode! Next up, defeat Evangelion
Look, I love this anime, but that was just silly. Yahiko's move with the door was physically impossible... also wouldn't it have been easier to set Kyoto on fire using the giant dude in the first place? I can forgive a lot, but c'mon...

The creepy part wasn't that he turned his head 180, but a full 360... >.> Turned left to look at Kaoru and Misao, then the next scene, you see his head coming back around going in the SAME direction!
There's something about Hannya that makes it seem like he wouldn't be a father figure to a little girl......oh wait, maybe its the freakin scary demon mask!
Ah, she's grown up around daggers and knives, I don't think she ever thought it was scary.
Finally! Kaoru shows she's not useless after all! I stand corrected.
when fuji arrived, i was kinda expecting levi to come and cut the neck. Just two random ropes coming out of no where and getting that monstrosity...

Yahiko and Kaoru beating two Jupongatana? Seems like an ass pull to me.
told ya Kaoru is no push-over. This is just her first time not being compared next to Hitokiri Battousai.
Agree with squidman. Even Watsuki says it in the manga. His words are "Kaoru IS STRONG." He says she's just always around Kenshin and Sano so you never get to see her full strength
Her father was already known to be a formidable master swordsman, so it's not hard to see Kaoru as more than just a pushover, especially since she inherited the title of master not just because of her bloodline.

This is where I left off on a website-not-to-be-named; I'm so thrilled CR has this now! Great show! I love how there is humor even in the midst of big battles.
