I'd say the first episode delivered. This looks like it'll be good. And how could anyone NOT like Yona's hair?
Hak is such a BADASS!!!!

agreed poor girl
Need to start a Yona's Hair fan club.
Started watching this show simply because I love her hair
"I pray that...the peace in this nation will last for all eternity" Well now I know disaster is imminent.
@branden96325 You, my friend, have just won the internet
Believe in yourself! Don't believe in the me that believes in you or the you that believes in me, believe in the you that believes in you.
So many thumbs up for this conversation
@branden96325 LMAO nice

That one scene in the opening made me think "And everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked."
Actually, just a few bars of music in and I was having flashbacks of Juuni Kokuki!! I had to look it up after to confirm that the music was also by composer Kunihiko Ryo! If this show is even half as good as his former series, I'm happy!
I wouldn't hold my breath. This looks like it will take the boring path of "naive little girl finding revenge (and romance) after tragedy blah blah blah". Juuni Kokuki is incredible and way different from this. But I agree the music is good
I read the manga. It's a lot like a more serious, reverse harem version of Slayers. It's really plot heavy and creative. Mmmm....Fire Emblem....
Literally what I was going to say. Exact words.
I was getting so many Avatar: the last air bender vibes from this until the OP ended
Well, that ending was certainly a....Hak job.
Soo Won, and thanks for all the fish! ^_^ (I know, I had to dig deep for that one =P)
> ^ >
Um... He really GLAIVE those guys a run for their money. *wince*
I see what you guys did there.....
*Puts on sun glasses* Yeaahhhhh!
I love the princess and Hak's relationship, it's so hilarious! x'D
Reminds me a bit of Nike and Levi in The World is Still Beautiful.
^^ had the same thought as well.
I love Nike and Levi! <3
Hak "Hak is about to die under the weight of the princess." XD

OK, so there's some anime humor, but for the most part, it's been pretty serious. ...wow. This might actually be pretty good.
That was nearly an overdose of girliness and awkward crush, but the end made it interesting.

I think the key thing you are overlooking is that he could become king eventually. Eventually could be a long time from now. If you look at the British crown, the second in line has been waiting for 65 years. He wants to be king now.
@munsterhouse I've got to agree with @drake3716, there is no standard 3 episodes with anime, your either in or out. There is of course an escape clause if you really can't stand an anime but for most part just sit down and watch it all.
Just imagine if the mc was a guy and Hak and the lord were girls lol...
Am I the only one in absolute love with the opening song? Holy heck that was good. Haven't listened through a full opening in a long time until now.
That was the most orchestral opening I've ever heard.
I wanted to put it on repeat honestly. Felt so refreshing.

Like a smooth opening to a movie. Very nice.
Another instrumental OP? o_o I hope they don't change it midway like they did in Brynhildr in the Darkness (Gokukoku no Brynhildr) >.>
looks like she fell for the wrong childhood friend
I hope I'm not the only one that wants Hak and Yona to be a couple or at least have their "engagement" be real.
Yeah, she's pretty obvious about Soo Won, so he's being the "noble gentleman" and stepping aside, putting their happiness above his own... and then that whole ending came in and trampled all over everything o.O
No such thing as the Friend Zone. Just some relationships aren't meant to happen there and then. Sometimes later, sometimes not at all but calling it the Friend Zone is just sulking over not making it to a couple with someone.
of course there's such a thing as the friend zone. stop being such a SJW
I can already tell this is going to be a Shoujo-esque anime when it comes to the romance, so the chances of that occurring are pretty much 99.99% likely. In other words: it's going to happen and it's going to be good.
I love how even the horse had to turn & look at Yona with Hak like "wtf are you saying" LOL
Hak with no mercy on those guards! I am loving the instrumental op as well as the ending, and so far its just like the manga. Thank goodness its 24 episodes.
My douche-sense was tingling every scene that involved Soo-Won.
^ agreed. I feel like a lot of us watch so much anime that the plot is obvious three minutes into the first episode.
Love the first episode! Yona is so cute, she looks like Chiyo.
So I'm not the only one who thought that
NOTICE ME SENPAI
Moar ribbonz puhlease
Yeah Soo Won could at the very least given her his autograph,
im 21, in college, go to the gym often, party, and god damn i love cutesy love shit like this.
I feel ya brother. I'm the same way!
I'm a pro wrestler and I love this stuff!
The OP made me think of Fushigi Yuugi and that vibe stayed throughout the episode. I like it. I was actually hoping Soo Won would die tragically so she would ship Hak. But I'm guessing this 'll do just as well...

I thought as much only cause I've been watching shows with alot of betrayal in it. Just something about him, soon as he told Hak to go see who comes and goes I thought "hes involved in something bad don't know what yet"
I was really looking forward to this and it didn't disappoint me. It has sort of a classic anime vibe to it which I really enjoy... you don't see series like this very often anymore but whenever they pop up I almost always enjoy them.
Kinda saw that coming from a mile away.
good thing i wasnt the only one that saw it coming
Same. I think its cause I've been watching alot of anime with alot of backstabbers that I even thought this.
Anyone else feel like they're watching an anime take on a period K-drama? MOAR.
