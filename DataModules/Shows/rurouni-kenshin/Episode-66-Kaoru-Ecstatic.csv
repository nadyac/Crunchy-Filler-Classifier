Yep. Though it was a poor excuse since he hasn't been fighting at all. It would have been cheesy but better if he picked up some flowers just after saying that.
what'd ya mean? he just got pwned by Kaoru XD.
More than once. XD
Even though this is a season 3 filler episode it is quite possibly one of the funniest episodes in the series. Worth the watch.
Honestly, I feel that these episodes is a nice wind-down from the intense Shishio arc. Lots of anime just kind of cram the last fight and after events all into one episode. It's kind of nice to have all these episodes to see how they cope.
This one episode is worth whatever happens next...
one of the best episodes!!!
Men. So unbelievibly clueless.

anyone else notice the animators changed from this episode onwards
Not as great as everyone else makes it sound but it is nice to have a episode focused on romantic development.
lmao so cute and funny
