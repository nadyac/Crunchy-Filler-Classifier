When he turned out to be 'bad' I didn't flinch, I spent the start of the first episode saying "he's a bad guy, this guy, right here, bad guy. Tragic twist, this one, gonna start killing people left and right. Bad news, stay away"
its called Ao...the chipmunk/squirrel
@ltzerge so did i he had a shady feel to his personality
I like the series so far, reminds me much of Fire Emblem.
i dont think his a bad guy.... the king got a taste of karma
Oh My God! When the bottom of the staff crushed the ground right after "I just sent him to hell." ! Simply chills! I wonder where the other generals that guard the castle are...cant wait to see!

Yup I agree. Hak and the princess are as good as burned.
I think that is more or less the best move he could make at this point. Hak killed the king trying to steal the throne. The princess & Min-soo was in on it. Soo-wan played hero & killed 1 traitor but 2 got away.
I think that all of the other generals are the ones we saw at the end.


we didn't actually see any confirmation he's dead and I have seen often enough in entertainment those you thought dead aren't.
Two lines of dialogue my friend. My dad likes to say that in television, a character can be brought back from the dead with two lines of dialogue.
True thugs never die... Min-Soo, Oct 7th ~ Oct 14th 2014... T-T
I'm so sad. I really liked him UGH WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPENNNN

WOW....That ending tho...The power in her voice...the confidence...I just love it
Imagine how bad that line would be delivered in a funimation dub.
Well all the dubs use the same tiny pool of voice actresses so you really can't help but get them confused over time. They need a larger pool of VA talent and some INTERNATIONAL VAs as well (like my sister, for example).
Also, those eyes. Those eyes were as hard as steel with her resolve.
she became a bad-ass!!!!
That ending made me SO HAPPY! With awesome Op and awesome fighting/action and death and cute chipmunks and stronger MCs juxtapostioned brilliantly! <3 Love it! :3
Dat squirrel tho.
Very interesting way they wrote the story with going from past to present back to past again.
From my guess, it'll go back to the past again to tell the story of how the encounters took place, then a season 2 (possibly) to tell the present story.

"even though my father was crying tears of joy,I didn't utter a single worfd of thanks to him" :'(
#HakxYona or we riot.

I ship it!
I am onboard with the Hak/Yona train!! XD
The original ship is Hak/Yona. Harem an go suck the chipmunk. Hak/Yona or I destroy.
Seriously...
RIP Min-soo. We will never forget your undying service to the King.
Man, spoiler tags, they're a great thing right? It's a shame people like you do not know how to use them.
That;s why you read comments after the video! :3
Episode 1 got my curiosity, Episode 2 got my full attention. What's even more sad is this all happened on Yona's birthday...
Birthday, shmirthday! I want to know her growth in becoming a wussy princess to being hellbent on vindication!
wait what happened? I lost all train of thought when I saw the chipmunk
One of the best shows of the season. Yona's going to become a badass soon enough.
Definitely one of the top titles, though Fate/Stay Night and Log Horizon are epic so far. The second ep of Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis was amazing as well!
I wholeheartedly agree with Gundam, and am adding Parasyte to that list. Also Garuda let's just say Yona had one hell of a sweet 16.
You have to wonder what the story was behind the death of Soo-won's uncle after hearing that. These things are never as simple as they are first portrayed.
yeah Soo-wan's father and Yona's uncle... totally getting the behind the scenes badguy vibe here like drake said
No way he killed his own brother. He was a kind King, always avoiding conflict. Not to mention his brother was a war lord! Soo-won's being manipulated.
Yeah. Soo Won's story doesn't check out. I bet anything he is being manipulated by that one fellow.
If king Il didn't kill soo-won's dad, then why was he so suspicious of soo-won and didn't want yona to marry him?
Uncle was a war god. How could King Il have such power against him?
"Did Princess Yona see you?" Are you f**king blind?!
That's what I said. Although I was thinking more about that awkward moment when Yona asked her father's murderer to call a doctor.
"No you peon! And now you just spilled the beans!"
He could have killed the king before Yona came inside, I think that's what he was asking (Did she see you kill him?)
That final battle made me forget this is supposed to be a shoujo anime, Awesome!
Probably one of the better shows this autumn. So far, the pacing is good and I don't see a lot of the usual shojo tropes here. A previous commenter mentioned Saiunkoku Monogatari, which I think is an apt comparison.
If you think it's similar to Saiunkoku Monogatari it might be because the person doing the music is the same (said person also did the music for another fantasy anime Twelve Kingdoms. The anime feels like a mix of those and fushigi yuugi.
It does contain a few tropes later on, but as someone who is almost allergic to shoujo silliness the manga for this gave me faith in the genre again. Highly, HIGHLY recommend people stay till the end.
Heck yeah, I was totally thinking about Twelve Kingdoms while watching this. Love the music in both!
Correct me if I'm wrong, the setting looks very Chinese, the name of each characters sound Korean...
The creator is Korean from what I remember, and many of their styles of dress look Korean as well.
Next week is to far away.... Rages!!!
I don't have a life to give to that piece of crap. You tell 'em Hak.
Min-soo. You da real mvp.
Hak sure loves to hack-n-slash his enemies. *shot by arrows for terrible pun*
I'd make a pun about Ming-Soo, but that would be too Soo-Won.
Another spectacular episode! Great action, great story, I'm excited for episode 3!!
