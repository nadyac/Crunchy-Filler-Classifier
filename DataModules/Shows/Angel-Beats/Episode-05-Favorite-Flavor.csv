these rocket chairs were one of the funniest thing I've seen in anime.

and the slow music too
i was dying when the rocket chairs came to place lmafo
Just loving the instant slow-mo replays with the nice music hah.
I think it's like the Japanese equivalent of that "Oooh whatchya' sayyyyyyy" meme.

im gonna cry... poor angel. yuri.. GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF.. .-.
Don't the regular students notice something .....strange about these people?
I would if i were them
They are NPCs I would think not, but the scene after the credits may lead to proving me wrong.
o man that seat scene with the slow-mo instant replay had me dieing of laughter
i know i laughed soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much
Omg yes
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THE CHAIRS OH GOD THE CHAIRS!
Wow... this made me laugh my ass off during the testing period and then kinda sad at the end. STOP MAKING ME FEEL SO MANY EMOTIONS IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN! (jk don't stop please)
Can't believe this anime is long forgotten. Nobody talks about it =/. Aleast crunchyroll revived somewhat of it.
@StrikeFreedom2329 What is better?

@Selphares I don't think that's what vampire5003 was asking
Not being forgotten, haha we I still talk about htis anime with my friends, and still watching it again ouo


Already from the start I began to feel bad for Angel. It really looks likes she have feelings...
It kinda feels like they are bullying her... Which, I mean, they are... But still... It makes me feel so bad for her ):
"will I have to ask her out again tomorrow?" "I'll try taking off my pants next" This episode just cracked me up!
I really feel sorry for Tachibana. If you ask me, she is just misunderstood. D'aww....Such a sad series. xP
Yuri really reminds me of Haruhi from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
With her god like powers she invaded this anime and took over as the main character.
She didn't invade, she made it herself singlehandedly.


I feel bad for Angel. I don't think she's evil at all. They're hating her without even knowing what her motives are or who she really is.
All they know is that she's caused a their friends to be "obliterated" and I don't know about you but I would hate someone who made my friends disappear.
I feel like it's kind of making a comparison between Angel and the Mabo tofu with the multiple layers thing.
hmmm building sympathy for tachibana? interesting twist...
The Testing Operation was too funny!! I didn't expect those rocket chairs, the song in the background along with that replay was priceless, I died laughing!! xD
Ok I can't take the ending song seriously anymore now. It kept reminding me of the rocket chair sequences!!! I keep bursting out laughing through my teeth!
I love how takamatsu is super stupid,..but brilliantly handsome
