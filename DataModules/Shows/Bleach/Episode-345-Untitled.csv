"Hes not some anime character" good one karin. >:p
Oinstinczo oh MY GOD. Get out
slightly breaking the fourth wall LOL
XD
@BakemonoTab Your god cant save you from Batman puns. Do you think he gives you power over others?
heheh Ishida's dad and Ichigo's dad
Recap ends @ 2:20
needs more thumbs up! Take mine!
It's wierd that Orihime doesn't just heal ishida.
She has limits. And yes @funfur, its bullshit! From an interview from Tite Kubo, the fat viziard doesnt get his arm back, but Soi Fon does.
No it isn't. Ishida literally tells her not to.
It is previously stated that Orihime has a hard time returning reiatsu to it's original state, so considering the magnitude of a technique like Mugetsu, it's probably nigh impossible for her.
I still think that he could have beaten Aizen without using the final Getsu
They also state that she has trouble healing wounds caused by a foreign spiritual pressure, hence the reason it took her a long time to heal the hole in Ichigo's chest last arc. Ishida's dad just said he doesn't recognize this pressure.
Love it when his sisters say "Ichi-ni" like they're counting....on him!
gah..old arc way better what ever happen to nel D:
PPFFFF HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Orihime freaking out and seeing Ichigo with the suit hahahahahahahahhah
How did Perona(One Piece) and King Bradley(Fullmetal Alchemist) get into this anime?
Because Bleach is so awesome, characters from other anime want to be in it
this is getting COOOL lol. I Seriously thought this anime was gonna be completely over after Aizen.. but damn they rebounded well with a completely different story, YET it's still bleach lol.
I miss my darling rukia =(
Might just be me, but doesn't tatsuki's hair look like how ichigo's looked back when he fought aizen?

agreed
ikr sometimes a little common sense would be handy. Didn't your parents say never trust strangers

heyz, I may have a thought about why Orihime didn't heal Uryuu! Thinking it might be, because she didn't want to disrespect Uryuu's father. Cuz he was the one to patch him up, so it's might be like saying he wasn't good enough....or nah?

middle of the night, the staff that stays on usually stays in the middle of the wings and makes rounds once in a while in a normal hospital
Welcome back, Bleach. We missed you. Particularly me after ignoring a whole year (or more) of filler arcs. My enthusiasm for Bleach has been officially renewed :).
Arisawa is so hot now omfg. Inoue is so hot now omfg. Ururu, Karin, and Yuzu are soo cute now omg.
omg! just... omfg!
Yeah, I'm not digging her mullet so much. It's like she started listening to Bon Jovi during the timeskip.
Hey... don't make it sound like Bon Jovi is a bad thing now... even if what you say is true...
I hate this. Ichigo's friends and family lying to him and keeping secrets from him. The only reliable source of information are enemies. And now Ichigo is giving in to blackmailers. Since nobody would tell him a thing.
Strange...why didn't Orihime heal Ishida?
He IS an anime character. :3
Why can't Inoue heal him? Makes no sense.
