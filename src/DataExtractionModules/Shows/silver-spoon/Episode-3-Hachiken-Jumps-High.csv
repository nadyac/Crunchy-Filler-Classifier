Maron's agitated face when Hachiman was hugging him xD
It all makes sense now

lmao! it does
If Maron could speak I bet he'd sound like a yakuza gangster.
I figured he'd sound like Sakaki-sensei from Kenichi
"Do you have feelings for Aki?" "Actually, yes" "YOU JUST WANT TO GET IN HER PANTS!" "Of course not!" "WHY, IS SHE NOT CUTE ENOUGH?!" Hachiken just can't win.

Silver Spoon, you never fail to put the biggest smile on my face! :'D
Specially with this new ed... it's so fluffly ^^
It's such a happy heart warming show

i wonder what your smile will look like when this show ends. >;)
Lesson learned: every choice is the wrong choice when talking with Mikage's dad lol
It really hurts to see Hachiken be so hard on himself like that...>_<
But it is so accurate with what people will do to themselves.
Yeah lots of people do exactly that same thing. I do personally as well, not as bad as him, but to some extent yes. I call it a superiority-inferiority complex. You consider yourself superior, but constantly feel like you're inferior.

While hachiken was laying there looking up at the horse, I was kind of hoping he would say, "Asshole"
Maron is the best Tsundere horse
It's--It's not like I jumped that high for YOU or anything! I just felt like doing it. baaaaka!
LOL, as Maron gallolps away......
Best ending song (for me) this winter! And lmao at Tokiwa and Maron!
It's between this one and the old one. Both are so great!
Goose House is awesome. I wish they'd post the full song on their YouTube channel.
This has some great OP and ED but I think my favorites I've seen lately were in Natsume Yuujinchou.
I am a huge fan of the OP and ED for Monthly Girl's Nozak myself.
Dangit. I miss it when every episode made me super hungry afterwards. Still great but I miss that food porn factor.
yeah, especially the roasted corn at the Mikages
I like how they become the animals while eating.
I wanted more pizza...
No matter how bad of a day I've had at work I can watch just one episode of this and it brings things back into perspective. Things only get complicated if you let them be.
The Dad always cracks me up!
Now I need my own Vice President ._.
Hachiken x Mikage
It's coming, I can feel it.
Duh
It's been my OTP for a while now. Trying to catch up in the manga...
lmao when she said they might need to get put down, the other horse was like what??!! 7:56


He looked so intense O.O
Haaaaawt. Glad I wasn't the only one thinking it.
agree, want to see of that!
Now I'm a guy, but I think the thing that made Hachiken most attractive in that scene was that fiery passionate look in his eyes.
i was thinking her looked kinda cool
Aki getting embarrassed like that was so cute LOL!

This is the one of the best slice of life shows to come out in years. I'm DEFINITELY buying it when it's released.
Mikage's got a complex? Looks like you've got a pretty big one yourself, Hachiken.....
Episode 3 and still one question remains- who the hell is the curly haired blonde?
