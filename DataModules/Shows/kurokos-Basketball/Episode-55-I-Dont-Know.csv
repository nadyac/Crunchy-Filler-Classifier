The power is way too OP!
Didnt it became unnatural at episode 1? An invisible man that people miss constantly.
What happened in this City that gave High School Basketball players superpowers, and why aren't they using them to save the world?
That's because anyone who has perception good enough to always catch you, and the skills to maneuver to get you off balance at will is OP (he seems to be able to do it in the split sec. window where his opponents commit to anything).
It's NBA Jam! The hoops about to turn on fire!
The geass,,,it's too powerful! ALL HAIL LELOUCH!!!...wait, I mean Akashi!!
Did anyone notice one of Rakuzan's player's face was covered at 10:50?
what if he is like kuroko, it would explain why nobody really takes notice of him and why we don't really see him so far. And it could be what Akashi meant when he talked about the true meaning of having Kuroko's power discovered by himself

Maybe they're saving his character for a different match
not sure if that's supposed to be a wink at manga readers, since it doesn't make a difference weather we've seen his face or not.
Whoa. I like the face Midorima made by saying "Thank you" after his senior gave him his next lucky item. It is like you never expect to see this side of him.
Akashi is the coolest, he just straight dominated everyone in his path.

I often enjoy the insertion of basketballs into nets on Saturdays.
isn't the episode picture the same picture as last episode picture? you know... the picture?
Yes.
picture=thumbnail
I Don't Know
It is it threw me off at first when I opened my queue and saw the same image thats been there all week thinking they didn't have an episode for some reason this week.
It maybe just me but I found Midorima really cute in this episode! :X
I always thought he was cute but I have a Megane problem.
Akashi has major Napoleon Complex haha
o.O Was that Jason Williams @ 18:45???!!!
Was thinking the same thing. I was like, "He just went White Chocolate on them".
I'm glad someone else knew where that behind-the-back-elbow pass came from, that's not your typical NBA knowledge right there :) Also glad to see they did their research about basketball. Hell, Hyuga says Ray Allen is his favorite player.

I don't think they'd have much of a court left over if Hayama ever decided to dribble with all 5 of his fingers...
Am I the only one who wonders about Kuroko's mom, Imagine Kuroko as a kid his mom wouldn't be able to find him half the time XD

he like he made him wet himself lol
At the beginning of the episode it says "Exclusive streaming for .." For some reason I forgot that was even a thing & kind of freak out when I saw it, and then felt all happy & tingly inside like "aww" then i realized i wasn't special.
Akashi did the Jason Williams elbow pass :O
Sit down Kagami. You bow down when in the presence of Akashi.
That is not in the author's spot... :( Kagami was a fine chara until WC with his powers-up.... I wasn't into Akashi in the first place,,, BUT,,, thanks to him...... I have fall deeply for Akashi..... ^_^
But......they're sleeveless.
Its a lie he is not using the emperors eye more like emperors haki!!!
I feel like i've seen this thumbnail before
