At least Sanosuke got a little stronger, but Kaoru and Yahiko... they are going to Kyoto just to get in the way. Dx
Yahiko could help a bit afterwards. It's Kaoru who gets pretty useless afterwards.. Just kept worrying about Kenshin.. -_-

I have a feeling Sanosuke and Anji's reunion wont be what they are anticipating....
You guys realize we're all basically those foreigners on the boat, right? -.-

They don't make it like this anymore :3 Ah.
Man Im glad they put one of my Favorite Series on Crunchy Roll Now All I need now is High School of The Dead
Simba......
Is it just me or is Sanosuke extremely similar to Ryoga Hibiki from Ranma 1/2?
What a twist!
I've spent years trying to master the Futae no Kiwami, to no avail. It's only useful on people and other living things which tense and relax after blows.
Oh God. Why isn't there a real life Sanosuke..?? Can someone just tell me..?? In terms of this episode though.. ONE of my favourites. Teehee.. :')
