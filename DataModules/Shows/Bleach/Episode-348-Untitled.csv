WHAT IS THIS? A TRAINING FACILITY FOR ANTS?!?!?
lol Zoolander
They sure pick some of the weirdest training for Ichigo
It has to be atleast two, or three times bigger.
recap ends @ 2:16
so noone notices how much cuter Yuzu is now?
shes got an oni-chan fetish XD
Good thing Chad came back from shopping
Does the shopping and then helps Ichigo manifest his Fullbring. Such a good guy that Chad.
Does anyone else think that the moustache guy looks like King Bradly From FMA?
I can see a slight resemblance
I agree.
lmfao, i do now
So let me get this straight. She'll only let things that she loves into her box?

Mr. Pork grew inside her box... Hehehe...

HAHAHAHAHAHA......sorry, that wasn't very funny Honestwing.
I don't get it Can someone explain?
ZOMG the double entendres! "I give permission for cute things to go in and out of my box!"
it would have been hilarious if Ichigo figured out fullbring in like 5 minutes, then they told him he and Mr. Pork would have to sit in the box until a half hour passed. That would be an awkward 25 minutes...
This arc is weird and ichigo is cool
I agree with some of the posts... it does feel different from the rest of the series. But Ichigo.. <3 So sexy.
The screen cap for the episode makes it look like filler. I nearly kicked my dog.
in my opinion this is the best Bleach opening!!
i wouldn't say it's the best but i do like it a lot
"Why am I being yelled at?" "Make up your mind already" It's almost as if Riruka is Ichigo's wife xD
riruka is so hoooooooooooooooooooot
love the new opening and music.!
Well, Ichigo had both Hollow and Soul Reaper powers, just because he's lost his Reaper powers doesn't negate the Hollow ones - he just needed to figure out how to use them without the whole "demon that uncontrolbly devouring souls" part.
You know that when he goes full Hollow his protective instincts kick in and he always tries to protect his family/friends.
I hope Ichigo DOES get his powers back...
TIME TELLS NO RIES LOOOOOOOOL
wow, almost caught up!
I hate when it ends in the best part :S
