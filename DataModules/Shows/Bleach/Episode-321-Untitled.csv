am i the only one who thinks the best part of bleach episodes is the illistrated guide thing at the end? lol i love them
if shes so important, why let kon watch her in the first place. i mean, karin is stronger than him!!!
Why the f%$k does this Nozomi chick keep wandering around when everyone's taking the time to protect her and on top of that, she's being targeted. I'm getting agitated >.<
And what's with all the suggestive shots of her? (shirt unbottoned, naked, laying down all the time with her teeny tiny skirts) Is that supposed to make us like her more? It just seems like even more than normal to me.
why dont they just go balls deep in her already its not like shes not legal!
She's a little brat is why
Best part of this episode is right before Omaeda fights, so hilarious!
Lmao he was to ugly so he decided to change him.
Why do people think Bleach is boring? Tite Kubo puts so much effort into making this. Way more than the person who made naruto. Bleach is awesome!!
I think they're equally the shiznit awesomeness. Ichigo's final form sent shivers down my spine and Madara uchihas grand apperance was animation masterpiece dude.
Seriously, all Omaeda knows is to run away during a battle, how the hell did he even become Lieutenant of squad 2?
We've been through this: Money and family influence.
Soi Fon seems to have both arms? Why?
I can think of 3 possible reasons a: the regai is a copy so she decided to have both arms and uses reason b or c as an excuse b: Orihime healed her c: Kurotsuchi used that chemical of his Sucks to be head captain LOL missin an arm

Same goes for: Komamura & Yamamoto
LOL "wait, i can use a technique like that?"
hahaha such a funny battle "i didnt tumble! that was a martial arts move" lololol
Pay a few dollars for an account then JahNaeeSwaqq. Complaining isn't going to make them disappear.
Episode 3.. 2.. 1.. let's go!
XD the fat guy came looking good than the original hahahahaXD
LOL. Poor Omaeda. He doesn't get any respect.
I love it how this bitch just keeps running away.
Oh gosh Omaeda's imposter is hilarious!! XD
Two questions. One who takes care of his body in the mean time? Two, why does Rukia evn still carry that glove/why did she ever have it to begin with?
You know if so many of you are dissatisfied with this why are you watching? Go elsewhere.
theres gonna be no prob telling apart omeda xDDDD
Its funny how Bleach actually achieves good filler episodes, and how their animations do nothing but improve. GF Naruto
now this turned into a comedy! He looks way more handsome than his regular! lol indeed! THat's cheating! lol! Looks like the enemy is more powerful than the originals...! Not looking good for the good guys so far.
