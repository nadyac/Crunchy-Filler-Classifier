The opening... It's BEAUTIFUL!! Oh gosh, I'm gonna cry!!
The opening is awesome!!!
The OP so full of foreshadowing! Fantastic, after reading the manga of Tartaros arc, cannot wait to see it again here animated!
Was the animation coloring not as vibrant as previous episodes for others? Natsu and Lucy's hair wasn't as bright as it usually is.
Neither were Natsu's clothes.
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh!! Warrod's flashback to 105 years ago gave me goosebumps!!! Aaaaaahhhhh!!!

@morte111 That was not Makarov.
Makarov is only like 82 lol, the tall blonde guy in the flashbacks, was his dad, and he's a total babe ^,...,^
When i read the manga, I thought to myself Warrod would be so silly looking if he was all green just like a broccoli. Glad they coloured him like a tree instead.
I'm surprised I didn't realize it was him after reading Fairy Tail Zero. Got some surprise feels from the flashback
And so one of the most important (and exciting) arcs in Fairy Tail has begun, the new intro alluded to some big things happening in the coming story!! I cannot wait!


I love how every new arc everyone thinks its so good lol
The awesomeness that is Fairy Tail has finally returned, its about time for FT to get back in my top 5

"everyone turn right" Happy turns left. loses my shit
Also in that scene we can see that Wendy has a backpack in the shape of a bunny. so cute!
i like where this is heading ..wizards vs hunters cant wait
New OP song! I approve.
Me too! Going to go get out my piano!
The ending though....hnnnng. That is such an addicting tune. Better than the OP imo.
am I the only one having trouble watching this? weird...the video is stoping like crazy
@Bavultor ikr
Can't deny Takki & Tsubasa!
Awww, that Rave Master part had me grinning c:

I know, I was laughing hard!
I LOVE Warrod!!! Hahah!! He got me ROFL! "I'm kidding, I'm kidding." XD
I loved the tree watering himself gag :-) I'm so thirsty!

Awesome Rave Master shout out
Juvia: She's like a nastier version of Juvia. Lol! Juvia is so cute.
Juvia, you are so cute, just need a self-esteem boost, girl! Flare may seem nastier, but she was willing to wash - every inch (@5:49) - well, it was better in the manga, anyway, not just Lucy getting the ...benefits. :-)
I really need to read the manga then! XD
Anyone else notice the change in overall color?

i will most likey cry when we get to a certain part
It looked like they were missing some Red hue
OMG! When they punch Erza! O.O lol Then they go from fighting to hugging each other in fear.
They should've looked before they leaped.
This episode is beautiful!
Phew! Good ol' feeling of Fairy Tail! Haven't seen them all together starting a ruckus for a long time! Good times and an awesome Arc is beginning!!!
Is it bad that, as a straight male, I found that Laxus x Freed moment precious?
AWESOME new Music! And OH MY GOODNESS, Mavis is so TOTALLY My waifu. <3
That's kewl, for sure I'd love a 105yr+ spirit waifu like Mavis.
I love how the Oracion Seis took out Imitatia, Erigor, and Jackpot and were like, "We bringing the original squad back together."
So that's why he requested Fairy Tail!
Harcore fans! catch the Easter egg in the episode! Wendy and Carla are dressed up as the characters from Rave Master! Carla the snowman and Wendy the main character! Rave master is the previous manga written by Fairy Tail's author!
Lucy dressed as Elie, Wendy as Haru and Carla as Plue, not the snowman, and Rave Master is indeed a better manga than Fairy Tail imo
Erza as Elie you call your self Hardcore fans and you get Fairy Tail characters mixed up. The Groove Adventure Rave manga is one of the best I have read and needs more credit. of you love Natsu X Lucy Rave is the next Manga you should read.
