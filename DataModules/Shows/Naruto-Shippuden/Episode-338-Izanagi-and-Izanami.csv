First female Sharingan shinobi. I'd love to see another episode of two about her.

Wow nice catch Janitha!
I was wondering if anyone else noticed that.
so true i wonder if there is going to be any other than her


If he escapes, he'll no longer be an asshole, and Itachi wins anyways. And killing Kabuto won't end Edo Tensei. So the whether Itachi does anything or not, he still wins, cause that' s how a real boss plays.
yeah its basically checkmate
^Sharingan discussion: Sasuke awakened his sharingan when itatchi killed the clan. Then he kinda "second awakened" it when he and naruto fought haku, to protect naruto. Then he got 3rd evolution in waterfall og truth.
The Uchiha here, remind me very much of the Saiyans. Achieving the power of the Mangekyou Sharingan = achieving something like Super Saiyan, due to the conditions to awaken both are similar. Emotional tolls & something special for each.

All i was hoping for throughout this episode is to possibly learn the names of some of those uchihas. Especially the girl since she seems to be the creator of the izanami.
^Thanks Tatuzka
Maybe they could make a song to teach us their names... :p
please no, LOL
yeah, her mangekyo sharingan is really beautiful =)


Better he goes out at his peak as the perfect character that Sasuke and all of us remember. It was just great to see him again after his battle with Sasuke.
Every episode just gets better with Itachi in it. It's like every movie benefits from having ninjas coming out of nowhere. And this show has BOTH ninjas and Itachi, who is himself BOTH a ninja and Itachi... Best show ever...
In each of his appearences , Itachi has a new top-class jutsu First, the tsukuyomi in konoha invasion.......Next, the Amaterasu while battling Jiraya............Then the Susanoo........Then Koto Amatsuki............and finally the Izanagi..
to the danish chavista come and live in venzuela fool.
Another great episode of the Uchiha brothers!! It sucks to see Itachi leave again when he just got back....I wish he would stay and help out more with the fight
He's still here bud, and the next episode is pretty much a tribute to Sasuke and Itachi.
Yeah but after that he is gone
Itachi got a great swan song... I'm more disappointed that we didn't get to see more of Kimimaro, who we barely got to know the first time around. And Sasori, Deidara and Kakuzu could've had better encores too...
I enjoyed this ep; the feels were pretty strong. I'm sitting in the lounge of my college, watching anime and fighting back tears! For those who belong to the "more fights" faction it was a bore but for me, its eps like this that make a fan.
I totally forgot that this anime is NARUTO ... Long time no see Naruto!
You don't get it. It means that you have to be able to trust your comrades to help you out too instead of trying to do everything yourself. because you can't.
Lets not forget that Naruto knows all the names of the Jinchuriki and their bijous. He's really not alone....
If Itachi didn't die, the anime would have to change the name because he is so badass.
'He is not like you,you were perfect' :'(
it sends the message that you'll be crushed if you try to take on everyone's burdens by yourself, you need to have friends you trust to help you...
That Uchiha woman was a true bad ass
I got feels from this ep
Brace yourself, you're about to get more feels in the next one.

I think the next episode is the most emotional. Prepare yourself, I already have this watery discharge seeping out of my eyes.
So every ninja in the past killed their best friend.
best friend or family member or loved one. the uchiha sure did a lotta killing! no wonder they were hated, feared, and mistrusted in konoha!
The problem is 99% of the time the spoiler tag is used for things that occur during the current episode. But honestly, if you read comments discussing the episode before watching the episode, you deserve to get spoilers.
Basically my point is people continuously use the spoiler tag for things that aren't really spoilers, so the spoiler tag doesn't mean anything. There is no effective system to prevent spoilers for future episodes because people are thick.
I agree - there's nothing like a "spoiler of the current episode". Spoilers are always of AFTER the episode. If someone reads comments (which are about the episode - what else?) before the episode well it's their own fault then.
@i_van123 and stranger1158 TRUTH.
I remember when Itachi told Sasuke he and Madara were the only ones to ever awake the Mangekyou Sharingan... smh
davejo it isn't mangekyo exclusive. danzo used it and didn't have any mangekyou...
Ah ye, forgot about that Not that I'm trying to find loop holes or anything, but Danzo did have Shisuis mangekyo in his right eye so if the criteria is just that your body has a mangekyo it could work But that sounded silly just thinking
tobi uses spare eyes for his izanagis. so it doesn't HAVE to be a mangekyou eye
Itachi probably believed that him and Madara were the only ones to have unlocked since they were presumably the most powerful uchiha alive around the time of the Uchiha Massacre. Its isn't impossible other uchiha to have the MS.
Yeah, look at Kakashi. He has Obito's eye, is not an Uchiha, and was still able to awaken it.
the opening song Is growing on me.
I was thinking it has lk a... Quentin Tarantino kinda vibe-soundish-thingy haha
Interesting comment.
kind of reminds me of Ricky Martin - Livin' La Vida Loca with what DaOskii said.
No one? It's got a killer Spy vs Spy vibe in the very beginning of it!
I still much prefer the previous one.
Please don't go Itachi!!! WE WILL ALL MISS YOU!
Not gonna lie, I'm gonna shed a Tear when the re-animation Justu is done and there is no more Itachi....K I'm gonna Cry like a little Girl

Apparently every Uchiha has their own unique Sharingan
Next episode brought to you by Whitney Houston...
speechless for words about how to describe how much i love this anime <3

One does not need eyes to battle. ^-^
Danzo-style

@VickyViviVicci wrong. Did you not pay attention to Itachi or Danzo when he used it? It essentially lets you erase a bad outcome - nobody says that outcome has to happen to you. It rewrites reality.
The izanagi works because it is a powerful genjutsu that you put on yourself. That's what allows you to rewrite reality, I don't know how you can bring others back to life with it.
Shouldn't get too hung up about filler..... this tells the same story as Chapter 587, but it does add the bit about the two warriors, instead of the more generic explanation in the manga ... does that make it filler?
Just think of it as an expansion of what would've been a very short episode.
