Can we all agree that the most badass character just became more badass.
Danzo is the most hated. I can only think of one villain that I might hate more than Danzo. That crazy bastard, from ALO, that kept Asuna in a cage... Forgot his name. Sugou?
@yangbo Itachi isn't qualified to be badass because technically he was never bad, just misunderstood. But he is definitely an awesome character.
Yep, one of the best anime villains of all time. Also in the afterlife, the first thing Rin would do is slap Obito for turning evil then forgive him.
To think pretty much none of this would have happened if it wasn't for Danzo
mrfix: Was that a question or a statement? Also, to whom were you referring? Madara? I wouldn't call him "the most badass character". More like "the most stupidly and artificially overpowered caricature in the Naruto universe".

well when it starts the backstory of Madara you like him then you hate him then you hate him even more now you just despise his existance
its a seal "people" you know anime logic!! at least it's explained but yeah looks silly
How is Orochimaru likeable? He's like the only villain in the entire series that went "evil" just out of his own decisions, and purely for selfish reasons. Even Danzo (I still hate him) was at the very least attempting to help the village
I mean he is badass and cool but there's no reason at all to like him as a person...unlike most other villains have some backstory you can have sympathy and stuff
well most people hate Danzo than Orochimaru. Plus, Oro's now helping the leaf, but I can't wait until he goes evil again. He told sasuke that he wanted to destroy the leaf just out of a whim.
i thought the face was going to start talking with a high pitch voice and say hellllloooo lol
I thought it was gonna be Yamato... guess not
Oh god. Thanks for that marvelous mental image, I just almost died laughing XD
Madara is such a badass!
If any of you saw when White Zetzu appeared to the five Kage in the English dub, "HElloOoooooOo everYOne!!?! Let's play a little game!!" I had a mixture of being creeped slightly and thinking it was hilarious. And at that point dangerous
Haha, Madara took down a whole army of Allied Shinobi Forces, beat Hashirama, beat the 5 Kage, and put his master mind plan into motion. BAD ASS.
Intro took up half the show lol
You should try One Piece some time.
They took a week off of the main story to tell the story of Hinata and Hanabi, so they used a long recap what was last happening otherwise those who can't remember what they ate for breakfast would be confused.
so is there no more Arcs after this one
@joenail: the canon manga is finished...however, there's still quite a bit of drawn out fighting to go, and there's no guarantee we won't get a random filler.
random filler will most likely be like the robot Naruto filler XD
its all Gaara's fault, if he didnt take so long talking about his first friend, he and Shukaku could have been over there and sealed Madara up.... I blame Gaara
+1
#BlameGaara
Nah, he didn't even talk... He just sat there for 15~ minutes and then said "Yes".
hahahaha^
I like the part where his armor falls off and his shirt magically disappears with it.
Quick Sasuke, nipple twist Madara while his shirt's off!
One thousand years of pain!
Its no good, one of his nipples turned into a face! It will just bite your fingers!
LOL
It could end in February if it was rushed, and MAYBE they'd still cover 100% of the manga content, but the fights would be way too short. Filler scenes are what make the battles what they are.
That felt so short.....
*One Piece

Yea I love one Piece but man the anime is killing me... cutting off practically 10 minutes every episode
@jayman Naruto DO have an end date... Manga ended (8th December I picked up my shonen jump with the last chapter) so the anime will end in mid 2015 when translated last volume is out. Cant end anime before last volume is out on sale y'know
thats what she said
I'm just going to cryogenetically freeze myself and wake up in the future so I won't have to wait for all these episodes anymore, all this build up is killing me!
Naruto's Talk no Jutsu may be long and annoying. But damn if he doesn't have some good quotes.
Agreed.
i just watched it and i am a free user thank crunchyroll
Naruto should just nom all the tailed beasts and wreck Madara's faces.
faces....lol
"Your flames are hot..." *takes of shirt* "...but i'm hotter ;D"
I have to say Madara is by far the most interesting/strong villain ever in any anime.
I like Esdeath more. She is interesting/strong, and is also hot and got big boobies.
most interesting, possibly....strongest, i think buu wins that one?
Madara doesn't have enough "Schwing" to his step. (whoever gets that reference gets a cookie)
Hisoka seeing a strong person: SHWIING
Madara is actually pretty boring. He's just a crazy person with impenetrable plot armor.
Feel free to skip the first 3 minutes, we have flashbacks from... err...three episodes away... 387.
ty bro

I've been waiting for this episode for EVER!
