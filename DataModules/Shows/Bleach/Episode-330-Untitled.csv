u guys should watch harem its like 1 boy 10 girls -.-
Nozomi might actually care about ichigo a bit more though.
You haven't forgotten about Nell? What the hell happend to her anyway? Lying in the sand for 1month +
She's fine XD
Power-up nice... Kon getting more screen time than in all past seasons combined.
aw, kon's finally got a girlfriend. THE WORLD IS ENDING!
Welp, i bet inoue failed culinary arts
For the peeps, who've yet to see this episode, be sure to watch the short scene after the end credits, it's worth it this time
I can't believe I haven't noticed this, but Captain Yamamoto has very long eyebrows.
Why would a hollow even want her in the first place? She has no spiritual pressure.
That what I thought!
why doesn't the scientist captain regenerate the head captain's arm if he is able to regenerate his own arm -__-
maybe its cause soi fon and kurotsuchi always lose it the normal way, he actually used his arm as a sacrifice so it might be permanent
he regenerates his arm just like how he can turn himself into liquid, its only himself that can do it... prob because of all the different things he is made up of by his experiments on himself/other people. The Head Capt. isn't compatible.
The people complaining about Bleack are so silly, Bleach is amazing and people need to stop being ridiculous just saying
Neat, a new ending that recaps episodes one through fourteen. Now if we only could fit in episodes fifteen through three hundred and thirty, and perhaps translate the lyrics.
Someone needs to get Kon a body. Poor lil guy must always feel left out when Ichigo has his body.
Why the hell did she leave the house for? Couldn't contemplate in the backyard or something?
Captain Unohana, the only person who can make Captain Yamamoto cry!
i really want to know. does kon ever get a body? that's not a stuffed toy?
Nozomi really annoys me. :/

Kon really annoys me. :/
Hmmmm....... I just watched a commercial for Verizon's fios service - in Chinese.... I couldn't understand a word of it, but at least it wasn't ATT's propaganda lies....
Ichigo "take this CHOCONOMIYAKI!" HAHA
I like how Ichigo just stands there saying that the words "daughters" and "harem" aren't meant to go hand in hand, he just doesn't really know how to react to that and quite frankly neither do I...
Nice ep hehe Yamamoto at the end and Unohana prepared all the food and stuff already
Finally a chick that doesn't smack Kon away at every opportunity but she's flat! XD Poor Kon
