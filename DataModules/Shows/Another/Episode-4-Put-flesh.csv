Ropes or Ladders can't kill you? I do believe both can. You can hang yourself with a rope, obviously, and I think if a ladder landed on you, I say if, it landed on you in a certain spot, it could stab you and cause substantial bleeding.
Unless you jump out the window.
@ThisWasATriumph holy crap i love the profile pick
Going under a ladder is considered bad luck.

Kinda off topic from the whole show, but...does anyone else think that all the rust that is on the roofs and in the buildings themselves looks a lot like blood? Like its creeping me out.
Why do people keep getting it wrong. Asian and Europeans including Russians uses the same metric system. 4th floor = 3rd floor, 5th floor = 4th floor and ground floor = 0 not first floor. Only Americans uses ground floor = 1st floor.
Calm down meat. Eitherway to clear up some stuff. the reason the number 4 isnt used on floors is because the kaji for "4" is the same as for 'death" so they remove it. Its superstition in how in America we dont have 13th floor.
wait im not sure if its japan or some other asian country but isnt the reason why some buildings dont have a fourth floor is because the number 4 is unlucky or represents something bad? kind of like the number 13.
which also sucks because 4 is my favorite number. lol
Ordosan, the kanji for 4 is not the same as the kanji for death, they are only pronounced the same. The same holds for Mandarin Chinese, I'm not entirely sure about Cantonese though.
If the rules in Class 3 are so important to follow, TELL HIM THE RULES!
how does he know what the rules are? no one told him the rules, other than the school rules. and saigen, it is urban legend and the mass belief that causes these coincidences. I tripped and fell it's because of the curse...etc.
Its not his fault that he doesn't know the rules, but it isn't any one else's fault either, because if they told him the rules, they'd have to mention the whole deal with Misaki wouldn't they? So that would put them in danger too.
No, the reason why they didn't tell him the rules is because the first day he arrived was the olnly day they could tell him and the girl wasn't there but sense the day passed they couldn't because it would be to late.
That bird represents the nature of his character, "Why? Why?" He has a dangerous mind. He spends his time reading horror novels and Lovecraftian--he seems helplessly drawn to the bewildering. He'd ask curiously, "What are the rules for?"
They probably would've like him to go through their class ignorant and harmless, but at this point, they're not telling him out of self preservation.
Mabey spoiler? idk but i just realized that all of the episode names end up making up how to make a doll, rough sketch blueprint bone work put flesh build limbs....or is that just me.
what the... brilliant! Are you a dollmaker by any chance? I never would have thought of that. hahaha
I noticed, but I thought it was building a human body.

*brainsplosion*
wow....the presentation of danger, is a masterpiece. Final Destination's got nothing on this.
. . . . fuuuuuuuuuuuck. That's all that I can say to this.
yea i say FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOOOOOOU to those dolls that pop up when u least expect them i'm so glad i got my cho-cho night light
jumpscares are the only thing that can actually scare me , not to boast or anything
I have too agree only jumpscares or something very creepy........
i have to say i really dont get scared cause its just a thing for me not even jumpscares cause i think of all the out comes and say that could never happen


Yea from now on i'm wearin a life jacket,bullet proff vest a helmet that can with-stand 400 pounds shoes that can step in lava pants that can take a rocket in that balls and boxers that warms ur balls ..... and my vest well have air bags
you will trip and the weight of the helmet will break your neck...
dont forget to make it water proof so you dont need an umbrella... @KrozzTheHellBoundChild
I knew she'd be next. If they can kill the cute girl with glasses then no one is safe.
man and i liked her too she was so nice
Why are the Kawaii women dieing POR QUE!!!!
Darn it! Why her of all people? They keep killing off the ones I like. :.(
That's the point i guess
looks like "Another" person died.
Another one gone, Another one bites the dust.
I wouldn't mind seeing Mei sing that song as another person dies. :3
Another one bites the dust
@choriki Copycat...
If she just listened to the teachers and didn't run in the hallway...her death could've been avoided.
Don't run with umbrellas kids!!
unless its pointy!
The real question is: why aren't umbrellas stored on the first floor, near the exit?
@VGKanri a fantastic question!
This is why we need hall monitors. DON'T RUN IN THE HALLWAYS is what they always tell us!
I think that school needs to not have a class 3.
It makes you wonder why they never disbanded class 3...
I know! It should be the number 3 that's cursed.

The thing about this anime is the fact that it doesn't need scary pop ups or horrific screams the suspense is what reels us in for the kill
To ninjajake12: The number one rule of horror shows is th0ta the people in horror shows have never watched horror shows.
lesson: don't use any object that can change your altitude.
Don't use anything with moving parts, or no moving parts. Basically anything that can move, don't use.
I was really hoping she wouldn't die... well, fuck /:
i'm going to go cry silently in the corner now....
No, I liked her!
That was.. creepy. O__O But.. somehow.. I can't stop watching.. O.O; Awesome anime OuO ! *gives five stars*
"... and that's why i take the stairs."
...Ok' Just, dont do it with a pointy Umbrella

JUST FUCKING TELL HIM ALREADY. THIS ISN'T SUSPENSEFUL, IT'S FUCKING FRUSTRATING. /caps
They CAN'T tell him, because if they did, they would be putting themselves at risk too. Still frustrating as fuck though...
I've only seen this far, but if it's got anything to do with the name, he's going to keep waltzing around saying it everywhere without a reason to stop. The guy is dense. So are they, if they don't explain things to him.
talking about it, marks you for death maybe somehow, and supposedly the whole thing started the month before he got there.. the cousin?.. and the dolls and victims.. all female?.. I wonder if it can all be solved.
What i don't understand is why the hell doesn't he start connecting the dots? Shouldn't he be smarter? He reads a ton of horror novels. I just want to shake him and tell him to start thinking!
