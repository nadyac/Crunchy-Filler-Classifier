iaddedstabilizersbuttrynottomovearoundsuddenly asuna stands suddenly okay hope ability like posts again before next episode airs oneormoremissingvalues error message getting nerves topic remember folks thehigheryouclimbthefurtheryoufall im not crying your crying dammit asuna whom does crying belong liked your reply just because quote little asuna though so cute dang also got impression showed two different ages her grandparents first seemed sub 10 maybe even young second seemed closer 1213 cant like commeny some reason so consider comment like favorite part whole episode those few seconds where show marriage ring asunas left ring finger odd ive never heard commeny before can tell reason cant like anything prevent liking commeny comment means like comment above him not his comment well know understand why house bought so important first time can recall so happy while home shes finally freed her her melancholy bird cage apologies corny analogy just does asunas sub account which recall sylph knife nut specced pure melee dps look lot like her mother irl which raises some interesting thoughts regarding asuna views her mom imo dont mean its near woods where met yui not yuuki both met yuuki fought her separately huge tree either way its same house all around theres short side story about house asuna kirito go purchase alo its stuck one those huge cedars wargo rat wtf do very funny twisted fairytale quest get house back agree asunas sub account does look lot like her mother could see her mom coming back virtual world future would quite interesting reacts badassop kirito haha no fights monsters other action scenes know love characters an episode all talk youre experiencing happy tears just listening commenting each others weight made laugh asunas mom pretty cute game well course action series always great but love episodes like too very important story character development cant wait get part ln also did pull out excalibur exact moment youre referring though right before enters room pulls out his second sword which excalibur now saves most badass swords most badass occasions agreed did anyone think would funny asunas mom would met her virtual daughter yui but then itll probably really difficult explain yui first place so see mom got her magical room where kirito went yeah wanted happen so much did think point bringing her totally missed opportunity well maybe someday want see happens though but yuis programming lives kiritos computer so could really only happen situation where asuna introduces her all her friends damn sao made so sad qq cant shed tear but im getting all kinds water eyes fall damn youuu omg xd wouldve flipped 055 okayasunatrynottomakeanysuddenmovementsjump out chair seriously carter do understand words comin out mouth exiashiro what yo trying say likes fried burritos can not read cant tell serious playing along lol rush hour great movie though thinking hers daughter protected years dying but mom says cant see

right all better keep our eyes open what even pizza xd lol its gonna kill us all wondering what happened pizza friends keep asking worrying about pizza important should very different than your real weight your same other side but real thing seems little pudgier lmao mother daughter game banter love anime like some episodes just emotional not because someone died last part lol akame ga kill cough this comment removed ikr crying through entire episode loved second taken over day finish episode because cant get myself past amazing theme song kinda felt yuukiyuuki joke coming waiting anxiously made chuckle grin seeing loli asuna who else found her irresistibly cute ate those oranges say shes possibly even cuter than yui where do think yui got her cuteness thats bold statement bro raises hand aww pretty much melt saw little asuna so adorable awkward moment asunas mom becomes part kiritos harem shivers why not think its good lesson teach your child about taking thinking about your life choices know about several parents regrets feel very close because no one officially joins harem until kirito pats head asunas mom still safe now already blonde being his cousinsister man trying get one each type fairy race so can become very best like no one ever catch his real test train his cause moemon know its destiny would totally awesome kirito managed embarrass himself front asuna by flirting her asunasnewfriend only figure out her mother sorry kirito yuuki joining team asuna not your harem no wifi isnt fine even especially well populated areas all wireless transmissions interfere each other sometimes youll get lucky place where signal good but most time wifi spotty since show isnt present based off current tech its possible created way connect overlapping networks simultaneously never losing connection also wireless tech would advanced being able cover more lets just say 6g now wifi obsolete wont worry about wifi 4g6g all japan one top internet speeds world so can probably do normally some areas small rich country would bet its considerably cheaper upgrade internet infrastructure than us especially canada thus see services providing 2gbps download something drool about cant stop tears right now must game god freaking sword art always finds way move your heart shake your soul beautiful always asuna mom let take into world asunas mother why where going asuna were going feels trip cheap shot asunas part mentioning her mothers mom dad little manipulative guess only five minutes youve gotta work what youve got bringing friend sao recovery school without any questions slipups feels about unlikely bringing friend fight club without talking about fight club were seriously milking secret all its worth asuna well really would surprised asuna hadnt spoken about ahead time hospital then contacting school asking permission goodmorningprofessormindifibringanothervirtualrealitytrappedplayertoschooltoday surewhynotaretheyclingon wellyoumightsaythat its well explained ln her professor show mentions asuna spoke him earlier see no problem here its not like would go around talking about itsup john any horrific sao flashbacks last night appreciate
