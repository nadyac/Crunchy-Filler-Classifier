'Now I have incredible sense of deja vu' Asuna you cutie, your only missing that because Kirito was holding you.
Agreed. There isn't much time for cuddling when the (game) world could end in one hour.
it was actually her holding him, but close enough ;P
@Yasemin: They do, a lot of it's implied at this point. Don't forget an earlier episode Lis and them were talking about how they can't keep their hands off each other IRL, while they laying together in game. Animes tend to condense content
Isn't this a spoiler?
no, It happened in an earlier episode
klein hasnt met the person hes fated for yet, maybe its the guy who brings him that DAMN PIZZA!!!!
[This comment has been removed]
1 year later........... Wheres my pizza!!!!!!
@SkylerStorm1 3 years 2 years in SAO and 1 year after SAO ended
Plot Twist: The Pizza Delivery Girl was also trapped in SAO, and they just barely missed crossing paths, but eventually meet each other in ALO.. ~.~
This comment is excellent xD
I love how kirito had a dad moment there XD
@vanderhoof Yui did say the quest generator combines different stories...
@ jelsea: I thought the same thing! Yui has become an in-game walk-through cheat program!
You know in the king arthur mythology guinevere betrays arthur and runs off with lancelot.. But it might be an addition in novels and stuff and not actually a part of the original myth
It's in the original myth too. Lancelot and the queen were lovers.

@Vigrid Says the guy who has the picture of all the Bleach ladies in their swimsuits as a header picture on their profile....
Poor Klein. Even though he agrees with the others, that this NPC will betray them later, his samurai fixation (and his lack of a girlfriend) means he feels compelled to rescue Freyja.
In the end, Klein remains single
Klein and Lizbeth got chemistry
@AndyRiotz...Thor disguised as Freyja - that really would make Freyja a trap!!
Did the ed cut off early?
Ah, that happened to me, too... Not that it's a big deal, but I really love the new theme songs. Oh well..
Funny enough, I was reading this comment when it happened. Perfect timing I guess.
Happened to me too. I think it may have been on purpose.
They cut it a few seconds short because the scenes in the episode itself ran long most likely.

He is the only male in the harem for kirito, if you can't tell its a small joke that people use. I doubt there is a lot of shipping for kiriot and klien.
If it's true to the Eddas, it IS a gender trap.
But what if that is Thor dressed as Freyja Like in the story? Then Klein is back where he started.
meh i dont think thats it

"Now i have an incredible sense of deja vu" Between the vertical square, the lines & the flashbacks i'm sure we all did. All that was missing was Asuna hugging up on Kirito.
Man, online gaming support still sucks.
IT DOES
I never really noticed how many side hoes kirito has until this episode lol
Klein is single handedly better than his entire harem :B
wait they release Infinity moment in the US? Where can I buy it?!
Hollow fragment for US/EU and SEA contains the Infinity Moment storyline also. You can do both side by side, or one at time(Hollow contains superior gear through)
Wish they'd come out with an SAO 3DS game... Love to play the PS Vita ones, but do not want to buy the system just for that...
Yeah Klein is there just incase he wants to swing in the other direction.
'A Samurai doesn't eat. He just laughs' You tell em Klein, I am sure Freyja-san is watching your chivalrous attempt to score an NPC.
I guess he got over the pizza that he missed out on back in the day.
I see what you did there.
why go after other players....when you can score an npc? LMAO
NPC would probably be more submissive.
My my that is one big boss
Well, he is king of the giants.
Also master of Ice, so I don't think what most would consider a god to need more than his fists to beat as he refers to them flies.
It's like any dark souls boss, really
I'm wondering what he plans to do with his would-be wife when she's like a Barbie to him.
they struggled so much with that minotaur, idk how theyre going to beat the king of giants xD


but amazing

dang kirito, always kill stealing people^,^
Damn, perverted giant always thinks about plucking someone's flower.
The light novel line read " I'll love you deliberately, nuhuhuhuhu........."
I laughed right along with him; that's exactly what I would say if I was a raid boss.
It looks like one of those auto-generated quests features Jason from Friday the Thirteenth.
Wearing the hockey mask he DIDN'T GET until AFTER the event in the image happened!... Yeah, sounds auto-generated to me.
Let's not forget the girl in the well, from "The Ring"!!! XD (And whatever the original Japanese story for it was)
Kirito is channeling his inner Link
HYAAA AHHHA OOOH AAAH HAA HYAAAAAAAH!
He's pulling out the "Kirito Fighting" face. I think we all know which one I'm talking about.
All those glorious battles makes me think why aren't we expediting the development of VRMMOs? Oh right, it might get the whole world hooked into gaming and drop productivity to zero - but we'd be happy...right?
I'd rather get trapped in Log Horizon than SAO.
From what I've read, it's supposed to be possible but I doubt they'll go through with it. I guess it has a lot of risks since essentially your tapping into your brain and letting people fuck with it. That being said, see you all in Aincrad.
i don't think that will happen in our lifetime but i do think it's plausible though
Basic VR is already working on the Oculus Rift development kit 2 (DK2) with full head tracking, and hand/finger tracking coming soon. Neural interface is still many years away though.
I would have no preference. I've not seen Log Horizon, but from what I know you only lose your memory if you die. But what often ended up happening in SAO (at least in anime) is nothing short of beautiful, even with the permadeath.
That frozen arrow to the head doe.
Reminded me of Legolas
I was expecting Kirito to suddenly scream STARBURST STREAM and smash that minotaur but no


Read the mythology, Crimsomcruz. It's a super trap.

one word: Loke
