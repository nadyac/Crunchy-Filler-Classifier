Saito is my absolute favorite character in this series! He's just so darn cool!
Ken has PTSD that warns him of incoming danger.
This ending,"Heart of Sword," is one of my favorite anime ending themes of all time
This is where the series turns absolutely amazing.
Agreed, everything that happens previously builds up to this arc and it's awesome!
Oooo there's my favorite ED song.
now the the best start
Saito is shielded from his actions attacking and murdering people thanks to his position in the police force. This is gonna be a hard one for the team.
Okita is here. Looks just like the Gintama variation. Can't wait for him to enter sadist mode.
From "wandering samurai" to "legend of tokyo."
A Japanese man says to another Japanese man, "You sure have narrow eyes..." LOLWUTM8
That dramatic music at the end always gave me chills while watching the Kyoto Arc
I want floors like that of Kamiya Kassin's school!
Wow this episode.. setting the stage for what is coming...
This show got me into anime 3yrs ago...3rd time watching my favorite character finally
I need to challenge myself to watch this entire series in Japanese. I grew up with the dub, so I go with it by default.
WOO! SUBS ARE UP!
