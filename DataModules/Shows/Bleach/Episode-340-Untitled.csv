Also they had the perfect opportunity to get Kageroza to drink whatever they wanted, poison, sedative, de-fusion drink, and had Kon kick him instead
Byakuya and yoruichi make a great couple!Imagine their children,little caramel colored half cat and half asshole kids running around....awww
half asshole? I feel sorry for them when they have to go poo
^ I'm wondering why he got thumbs down when that was a pretty funny joke >.>
Because it sucked as a joke maybe
It's true. Cats are dicks.
Naa, Cat+Hat and Clogs=Kids
ichigo would have been dead a long time ago if this guy wouldn't stop to explain his plans every time ichigo is hurt LOL
Meanwhile, somewhere else, the Yachiru vs Yachiru fight is going down.
god u are sooo right xD
Its probably a candy eating contest.
Either that or the best fight of them all.
ya where is our pink haired freind damn never see her fight
its been 334 episodes but kon finally had an epic moment
they picked the best ending to have Gin
Where's yachiru? Chad would be so much cooler if he used diablo a whole lot more but i don't think the creators really like Chad, if hes really so unliked by them why is he still in the show?
My love for Kon has been re-born. LOL
i dont see why ichigo didnt just kill nozomi.... he could revive her later with the dragon balls.
Kageroza missed the simple fact that Friendship is Magic.
the power of friendship? -_-;
Does that mean it will finally be over soon?
20 something more episodes sadly, what to watch nexed sniffle sniffle tear tear
when did Soi-Fon get her arm back???
idk probably like the espoda and grew one and put it on surgical but good question
Kurotsuchi seems to be able to grow them back with a shot. Maybe he helped her out.
or Orihime healed her
HOLY CRAP! KON DID SOMETHING USEFUL!
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!, Kon should have just droped off Ichigo's pill and run away in that chicks body haha i hate Rukia so much always ruining my fun......
One of the few episodes that Kon does something significant

that moment when ichigo gets his energy back. like "hell fuckin yeah"
finally only 1 or 2 episodes then its onto the fullbring arc october can not come quick enough so much awesome stuff happening in anime ^_^
Good work Byakuya! Wooo! Kon, and go Ichigo! Kick the psycho's butt! hehe Urahara and Kurotsuchi
