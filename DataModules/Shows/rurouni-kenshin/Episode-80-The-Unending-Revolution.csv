Sano singing? Kenshin cursing? Whats going on here?

damn they must have a really big ant problem at the dojo!
Kenshin's "cursing" in this episode isn't that big of a deal. He says "shimatta!", which isn't really a swear word. Explanation here: http://www.japanesethroughanime.com/2010/03/learn-
OMG He cursed! This is as shocking as hearing Kurt Russel curse the first time in "Escape from New York"
not worse as sano giving the finger to mr broom head lol no need for translation on that one.
