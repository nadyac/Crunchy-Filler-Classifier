If you try to find something bad in the Naruto universe that Danzo didn't cause, you're gonna have a bad time.
I hope Obito reveals Danzo's part in this mess to Kakashi and Gai. Danzo was regarded with suspicion by some, & they din't like when he made that power grab to become Hokage when Tsunade was out of it, but they figured he was trying to do
the right thing. When Konoha learns that he was behind all of their misery, he'll be remembered for what he truly was, a warmonger, and traitor.
I thought fake madera was gonna turn out to be danzo tbh...
It's actually kind of ridiculous. Danzo is way too often the go-to villain to be blamed for Konoha's sins.
Doesn't matter anymore, Danzo has already paid for his crimes...
I suddenly hate Danzo even more.
I have already crossed my limit of hating him in Kabuto`s backstory

Danzo is a piece of trash. I didn't think he could get worse.
Once again, Danzo proves why hes the biggest Cuntbag to exist -_-
its not a filler
Am I the only one that thinks Danzo is a badass? Sure he kinda screwed the world over in this episode, but still...
game of thrones, anyone?

@SpiritWolf15 From a flawed or misinformed point of view, yes. Peace is not the absence of conflict; in fact forcibly manipulating the minds of the entire planet would count as "war". So... yes, Madara and Obito are in the wrong.
Am i the only one that misses jiraiya!! -_-

watching this episode just reminded me that he's not here anymore T-T
I was so busy hating on Danzo, that I forgot to pay my respects for Jiraya. So, I'm back to say my peace. Jiraya would never resort to touching himself. He'd spend all of Naruto's money at the "hostess clubs" partying it up with the babes.
I miss Jiraya to every time they show him I start to cry. Also I want to know more about what happened to Captain Yamato. RIP Pervy Sage.
I wonder how kakashi became perverted like jiraiya
The show gave a clue. Jiria said he wished that Kakashi would be like the hero in his book. The dirty books Kakashi looks at are Jiraiya's novels. Kakashi is reading the books that tell him how to act like the hero.

@superlevelhelper....Yeah, that's how Kakashi into romantic books, try to be the best hero romance guy, lol.
hmmmm good questionnn

Danzo of the Hidden Leaf. Destroying lives since the Great Ninja War
I think its highly possible that Danzo killed hi own mother after birth, I mean he is a crazy, and pretty mean idiot...
Danzo's kampf
*since the First Great War, you mean. There have been 4 (the 4th one is still going on, technically).
If he wasn't alive, we wouldn't have had this storyline. I 'course would stayed till episode 2, for the NaruSasu kiss yuheheh *=*
It should always be 2 episodes per week!
No, filler is anime only storylines, when using source material & reusing or drawing scenes out, it's called padding. Filler: digs a big hole & fills it w/ anime only stuff. Padding: stuffs scenes from canon to fatten them up & take longer.

Gintoki explains the anime/manga problem perfectly in episode 145, check it out.

filler or not, 2 episodes a week is much better than 1..
This episode has reminded me once more how much I miss Jiraiya.
Jiraya <3333333
Damn it Danzo! I'm so glad you died... >.> Can't stand him
But if he hadn't died, we'd still have the satisfaction of watching him die to look forward to.
With Danzo and Oorochimaru being dead, this show's antagonists are way too relateable. At least we've still got Madara, the Prime Evil
... You know Orochimaru is not dead. He was brought back to life a couple of episodes ago. ^^
Well, danzo was a bad guy I admit, but there is a reason that konoha of the hidden leaf has been the strongest ninja village. From his point of view, causing infighting in other villages to weaken them is good for the leaf to stay in power
I am so unhappy that Sasuke didn't make Danzo suffer more =(. Maybe by pealing his flesh or something would have been enough to satisfy my anger... The idiot was the cause of almost all the problems in the series so far...
And Tobirama Senju was the cause of Danzo. ( Tobirama also caused Madara, Obito, The Juubi, and almost the end of the world )
dude sasuke killed him 10 TIMES OVER
That was probably the longest 7 minutes of my life!
YESSSS!!!! LAST EPISODE WAS AWESOME!!!! NOW ANOTHER EPISODE!!?? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Go lower on the sugar dosage, man.
If these two episodes are supposedly filler then i'll be damned they actually hired a decent writer because i'm as drawn into these as i normally am with Naruto Keep this level of quality up and i'll be very happy.
Me 2, I'm with you in that one
Obito decided to patiently wait for Nagato because he knew that eventually they would encounter the dark side of the ninja world and lose hope. And he wasn't wrong. In the end you can't help but empathize with Obito. The world is fucked up.
Amazing filler, I agree.
My understanding is this is actually material from the manga, rather than the anime team trying to keep from running out of source material.
@esotericist It's not. The manga transitions from Obito talking to Nagato directly into the next part of the story. The anime is not going to the next part of the story but is instead putting in filler that never appears in the manga.
Nagato is so kickass, it scares his own self!
F**king Danzo!
Danzo is the main cause of most of the problems. He's the reason Kabuto is the way he is , The Uchiha clan massacre , destruction of the leaf , Akatsuki and probably more.

@ishida617 No, not really. Obito revealed that when he was telling Sasuke about the history of the Uchiha.

ufck Danzo.
The uchiha clan massacre was probably unavoidable, they were planning to rebel against the leaf anyway.
Danzo is clearly the Hitler of the series.
Seriously? Danzo is a bigger douche bag than Madara, and that's saying a lot. I think it's safe to say Sasuke was a real hero to the Leaf by killing Danzo.
great couple of episodes we got this week, i love getting background information on characters. this is the way all filler should be done
Agreed!
