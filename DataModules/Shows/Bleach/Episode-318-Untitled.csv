Truuuuue !!


So the one guy that isn't "spoiling" using the "spoiler" button. Yet the guy truly spoiling isn't?
I blame the writers for poor plot development.
Kon is clumsy... how many times has he hit those walls?
@jincri - get a premium account or stfu
lmao ichigo's sword is as big as rukia
The face of Isshin when Kon stormed into the bathroom.... best part of my day
I was like w...t...f..
Looking at the opening theme animation. I get the sense that Soul Society is gonna get destroyed....... again. I'd hate to see what taxes are like in that country... How many times has the capital been destroyed now?
Kon isn't as smooth as he used to be in Ichigo body... Seem all drunk now.
Ichigo should be like " hey guys, remember when i killed Aizen after he took all of you out?" I understand they need to progress the story, but come on
the girl is pretty
I really like Bleach but my one problem with it is, when ichigo was fighting Aizen he owned him throughout so what was the point in using the final getsuga- tensho and losing his powers.
I thought the same thing i was like why use your Final you Can beat him with your bare hands
the fusion of him with the sword was the final getsuga
hogyoku OP. If you don't destroy it, Aizen won't go down.
True, Beating Aizen wouldn't have been enough since the hogyoku would have made him evolve until Ichigo couldn't beat him. Ichigo had to annihilate him fast and hard.
Are we watching the same show? Even with the final getsuga Aizen was still alive and would have regened if Urahara hadn't sealed him.
Why can't Ichigo simlply say "I'm Ichigo the guy that saved Seriterei and beat Aizen, why on Earth would I have anything to do with any of this?"
Kon's fatal weakness has been discovered- pillows.
Not gunna lie, this filler arc is sick... Much better than the current arc in the manga.
thank goodness for Yoruichi for pulling Ichigos ass out the fire. She rocks..
Ichigo may be at a captains level, but he does not deserve the title of captain. Way to risky and selfish. We need to see more strategy. Lets go Ichigo

He's at a captain's level in terms of power, but not in terms of mental skills and experience.
Hah, this arc is sstarting off pretty good so far...

WTF is this intro? Who's on whose side ?

this is why bleach is tops!!
