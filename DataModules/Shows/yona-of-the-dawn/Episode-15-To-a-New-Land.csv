I'm loving this series more and more with each episode! Also Hak. Hak makes everything better. :3
@alcon505, do you realize what you just accidentally said. I lol'ed
It seems like most people in this show want a strong central government, not even realizing how good King Il was for letting people do their own thing, govern their own lives.
But the issue with that is that people can't govern themselves and this has been proven before. People need a central government but they will inevitably complain about the government they wanted so much. Basically nobody wins
@KaraZorEl If the people were governing themselves, taxes wouldn't have been collected. You can't take a percentage of people's earnings without granting them benefits in exchange.

Capital of the Earth tribe!? BA-SING SE!
True that.
@Darkmagick8, don't let the smooth taste fool ya! It's those "chill" ones you have to watch.
HOW COULD YOU GET MORE CHILL THAN BOOMY???
Well, Bumi was the king of Omashu, not Ba-Sing Se lmao
For memory: The leader of Ba-Sing Se was the guy with the bear. It was the city with the shadow government and the rock fists.
Not gonna lie. I greatly prefer the old OP. Not just the sound, I think those visuals just fit the old one better. RIP old OP, you shall be missed.
New OP doesn't fit. At all. I thought I had another tab open or something D:
I actually like this new OP more then the first one.
New OP is better happy to see the change.
Same, I really liked the old opening... It sounded like an epic adventure was about to begin. Also, the new ending makes this seem like an old Chinese Opera. lol
AWWWWHH DAMN! When the new OP kicked on, I was like YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH! Don't get Me wrong, I LIKED the original; it was beautiful. This new One really hyped Me up to march through this, the second half of the Series! ^__^

It makes you wonder if Yona was some sort of war god? That would be an interesting twist when she finally comes into a battle.
PLOT TWIST! Kind king IL only forbade war because he realized that yona, who was born with that rare type of red hair, was the reincarnation of the old dragon king hiryuu who hated war. He could outfight his brother and hak! *speculation*
^If he could outfight his brother and Hak, he got killed by Soo-won pretty darn easily. (I'm not sure it would matter much, anyways - it's nice if a king can fight, but it's not important. Far more critical is being a competent ruler.)

@Darkmagic8 He may have been good in battle only because of his dragon blood power. If it passed on and was the source of his strength he would be a weakling when he was killed.
New theme song. I'm not sure the J-pop is an improvement over the more classical sound. I do like the ending theme though.
I don't especially like the new opening song either (maybe it will grow on us a bit?), but I do like the new footage of Yona being a badass. Wish they'd added more of that.
Maybe it is foreshadowing...
The New Ending should have replaced the OP if they were going to replace the OP at all. Yona's original OP reminded me of Inuyasha's first OP (the one from episode 1) & the OP's replacement also reminds me of Inuyasha's OP replacement.
Nah, walk up to the club like, "What up? I got a big Hak!"
I couldn't agree more! Not liking new OP >_>
War games are very important to evaluate and train for real war.
Time to play some Fire Emblem!

^ for some reason I really don't want that to happen
^ I actually agree with you, even though Soo-won's my second favorite character. There's too much hurt for the three of them to ever reclaim what they had. It wouldn't be realistic, and would mess up the show's solid character development.
It really should be, "Everyone is antsy, let's go conquer a nation." It worked for Alexander, right?

I've been following the manga and Soo-won is still an enigma to me. Jae-Ha's observation (manga) of him being a traitor to Yona but maybe not to the country??? Keep expecting the fire tribe general to be his father's real killer.
Same...I find it too hard to believe that the former king would intentionally kill anyone.
Soo-won's mother is never mentioned. In the manga he blurts out that he "can't marry Yona". Not possible that the Queen was Soo-Won's mother? That'd be the only thing that'd be enough to want his brother dead. Pretty preposterous, though...
^I'd think everyone would know about it if that was the case. You can kind of shush people up when the father of a child isn't the mother's husband, but it's pretty hard to hide when a woman is pregnant for nine months and gives birth.
"You have no woman to serve you tea. -34 year old bachelor-" apply iceberg to burned area.
Pampered Prince is such a creepy mask
He's a Yandere.
Don't like the new opening as much as the old one, but it isn't at all bad. I guess I liked the traditional feel to the last one. xD
The old one sounded really good and this one is meh.
I liked the old one partially on the merit it wasn't just more generic techno J-pop fluff, but here we are. You will be missed, unique voice-less orchestral score!
I'm gonna have to agree with you all. I definitely appreciated the old opening more. It reminded me a little of the opening to the non-anime show Marco Polo on Netflix. Way cool.
Although the new op isn't as great, the op animation is amazing imo
The OP itself is fine it's just the sheer difference between this one and the old OP makes it strange
My thoughts exactly - guess I just need to hear/see it a couple more times. Man the beginning of the new ED is so beautiful! - love at first hear!!!
The new OP dates the series; a piece that matched the setting like the original OP would preserve a timeless appeal.
I just can't get over how divine the blue dragons seems. He's so kind and gentle, it's amazing!
Right there with you. I was so excited to just see more Shin-Ah today. His character really surprised me with how amazing he is. http://imgur.com/gallery/EBJ9J
I know! I love him. I also love the strong connection the white dragon feels with him- they're rebuilding their family.
Everything is better with a side of Hak!
Let it be known: Yona of the Dawn is in 3rd place on Crunchyroll. I love the manga, and it was my most anticipated anime of the Fall 2014 season, but I honestly didn't expect it to be this popular.
Good to know it's living up to Hunter x Hunter, its predecessor in the awesome Tuesday show bracket.
I think we will all be missing that epic intro, I thought is set up this show very well.
He was practically guaranteed to marry Yona and become king anyway, but he still killed his predecessor for reasons that likely won't be revealed for a LONG time. With no hint of his motivation Su-won is more frustrating than evil. T-T
It also probably isn't by chance it happened almost the exact time Yona was old enough to marry. Perhaps he is being manipulated by someone behind the scenes?
You can't say for sure that he was guaranteed. I mean, sure, Hak probably would've driven off any suitor but Soo-won, but King Il seemed very firmly determined *not* to allow Yona to marry Soo-won.
The King was completely against Su-won marrying Yona. He wanted her to marry Hak. He would not have been king if King Il was still alive.
He also might have some intel that makes getting the country prepared for war a time-critical issue.
I thought he killed the king to avenge his father and took the throne because of his father's wish? Or has that been disproven?
I hope this anime runs for another season or 2 and continues on following the manga as it has been so far. the animation is amazing and it's refreshing to see shoujo series like this
I like the new opening, but what is the king planning, his smile creeps me out!
That smile is creeping me out too, Opening is very cool.
He is going to show his power, he did match the Thunder Beast in a battle. He is going to shock the kingdom
he didnt match him... hak put yona's life above the fight... if hak had wanted too im sure he could have killed all those soldiers along with soowon at that time...
At the very least, though, if Soo-won had been truly incompetent then Hak would have finished him off before the soldiers could even think to grab Yona. He certainly was sending everyone else flying. This means Soo-won is rather strong.
I think in that battle Hak just wanted to keep Soo-won talking. I think Hak was like 'This is a joke right?' And in total disbelief. Probably be a different story their next battle.
Soo-Won is going to show his true colors soon? I'm not sure I'm ready.
That preview tho. Soo-Won is starting to show his true colors.
