That must have been one hell of a flick for Virgo the masochist to be so pleased by it.
I think we can imagine what she wanted to have done with that watermelon.
@Oldthrashbar lots of naughty things I bet
Hi random people!!!
hey random geazer
I think the watermelon has something to do with a musical called "Dirty Dancing". I literally searched "dirty things to do with a watermelon" and that came up. XD
Those flashbacks with Aquarius <3 I know I say this every week, but god I love Fairy Tail. Gonna miss the old intro because it was amazing, but this one isn't bad and the new ED is really freaking good imo.

So the next filler arc is going to be the opposite of the Golden Zodiac spirits?
@Manofsteelfan maybe
they skipped the best gate
imagin, if all here spirits closed the portal, even you know who, i can see i now, litle snowman dog flying across the sky
Way to make the tarturus arc even more painful
I was just thinking that... It adds alot of feels for the arc lol

Yeah I wouldn't have teared up at the end if I didn't know D:
this ride is going to be a painful one :C
Aquarius D: You were my favorite ;-;
Dat Happy Hair. 10/10

16thore, you might want to add a spoiler tag there ^_^
16 THORE HOW THE HELL COULD YOU DO THAT?!?!?!? WHY NO SPOILER? LEARN TO SPOILER
Damn what did 16hore said
amazing afro

Am I the only one who noticed she didn't give scorpio a wish?!?!
This has been bugging me.
She gave Scorpio a wish if you look at 9:45, but it's up for 3 seconds and no one *knows* what the wish is. Actually, what bothers me is that characters like Plue didn't show. Silver key characters barely show up nowadays. :/
She was thanking them for helping close the eclipse portal and the silver gates weren't opened during that crisis.Though she could have thanked them for their help earlier in the arc, like in the hell's palace tunnels.
Until twobooks comment I though Scorpio got skipped for being a cheating jerk, something would think Lucy would have no sympathy for. Just glossing over him like that fells cheap, I hope its because it comes up later.

You're also forgetting how he also suffered Aquarius' wrath.
everyone suffers her wrath lol
To see a cat being eaten by fish is beyond humiliating for happy for he is a cat
gotta admit when aquarious said make me laugh i half expected natsu to just punch lucy in the face when she said it


ooooo.. I wanna know what happens!!!!!

Is it just me, or does the new opening seem to signify another filler arc. Not that I'm complaining; you can't spoil a filler arc by reading ahead in the manga, and more Fairy Tail is always welcome.
Did you not hear that we're getting an actual filler arc? Don't know how long it'll be though.

the poor clock got shafted.
the clock has been missing in the last 4-6 openings
Yea, I actually really like the clock too... (Oh well)
They also didn't show us what Scorpio wished for at all, although he was shown talking to Lucy & co.

Yay more plue in the next episode. I love plue back in Rave master. It always funny that they describe him as dog in Fairy Tail just like Rave Master. Love the Aquarius flashbacks of little Lucy they were adorable.
Holy *$&! Aquarius has a heart!
That flash back with aquarius and lucy and that moment they had afterward was so sweet. I can see now why aquarius is one of if not the strongest of lucy's celestial spirits, its the deep bond the two of them have.
Ooo that backstory
If many don't know, Fairy Tail will be in another filler arc, so us manga readers have to bare with it till it gets to the Sun village and finally Tartarus
