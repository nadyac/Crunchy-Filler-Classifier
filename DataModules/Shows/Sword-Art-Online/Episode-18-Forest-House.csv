They can actually do their homework in-game? That is so cool!
its pretty cold in Canada right now.
its set in 2025.
It's sad that VR technology is almost impossible to adapt into safe gaming format.. Since people can just "nuke" your brains so easily. The IRL vr tech they are developing centers around manipulating brain static and that means brains would
..be easily destroyed by inputting pretty simple information in them.. like super shocking material. Also human slaves could be possible. Like you know how some malware make slave computers?
im betting there's a way to safeguard against that sort of thing like a program that checks all incoming data and can cut the link if its something dangerous or a surge.
Homework in game... Please take me to that land of wonder
Hopefully this becomes a future :D! I'm a developer (c#, js, c++) and i wanna work for an mmo company. If i do, im making this feature of doing homework in game XD
could be online homework which can be converted and they just feel like they are "writing" it down but is essentially one of those pens that records what you write.
@gonzales007 Euclidean Geometry is based off of the postulates of Greek mathematician Euclid. Things like, "only one line can be drawn through a given point parallel to a given line". Essentially, it's logic based geometry.
this thread reminds me of the MMO game in the movie "Summer Wars"
soooo coooll!!

They mentioned he was married when he said about his wife keeping the Dicey Cafe running, but this gave detail to that.

I just googled it. One look at a page in the manga and I summed it all up. Is it just me or is that a bit cliche?
@airron ooooh you are making me nervous, for something bad is going to happen isn't .
i Know
Time to fall in love with Asuna all over again
*sigh* goddammit Kirito

I've always thought Asuna was a great character. I mean yeah most of her screen time in season one was just damsel in distress but off screen she was one of the top players in the game. She's not as helpless as most people think
Sure, but season 2 she was just a popsicle for that creepy dude, and in GGO to not know what degree Kirito was taking and make rubbish small talk. Somehow her character has un-developed and I don't know if we can bring her back :c
I totally laughed at the Final Fantasy reference at 17:00

Oh how I've missed Kirito and Asuna's romance <3
there a power coupe when they fight, i love their teamwork =)
I agree. I really miss them together. From what I know of the manga, later arcs don't have them together either.
Must be nice, sailing the right ship...
That feeling of being able to just pay up 500,000 casually.
great man Kirito, makes his wife pay for the house
They're married. Their inventory is shared, remember? Her money is his money and vice versa. Think of it as having a joint bank account.
A real man lets the woman pay, but with his money.
There is not no wifi, just not a good enough signal for her wireless
Talk about first world problems. :3
raptor, its only 2025, my cousins up in the north don't even have 4G yet
2054? You've had too much COD AW for one day
^ HAHAHAHAH!!!! Advanced Warfare is awsome, but thanks for the laugh Wheezy-P


Sigh can we just do some retcon and add in another happy arc following this one XD

m8 ill be grabin some tissues and some hand lotion
...I am very VERY unhappy about these events you guys are hinting at...but glad you mentioned them. At least now I can pepare a little bit. I don't handle character loss/death/whatever might keep them away from their true families very well
I wish in 2026 that instead of sleep, your body can sleep whilst playing an VMMORPG. So that's like 8 hours extra of playing games, without compromising on day time
That would be the greatest thing to happen to humanity. Yes, that includes sentient thought and Hitler dying.
This was a great episode! I really enjoyed the dialogue and sentiment in this episode. Every moment had a purpose, nothing felt wasted. SAO going back to its roots is most welcome!
I loved all the little details that kinda throw you back into SAO, such as the massive fish in the lake x3
hope to god Asuna's parents are not trying to marry her off
It kinda looks that way- they suck! didn't they agree to have her marry the psycho NTR villian in the 2nd season?
Run away Asuna!
i wonder if that 9Up tastes better than 7Up
it probably has 2/9ths more calories
It likes you. reciprocate those feelings.
So Kirito and Asuna are officially a old married couple. Asuna entertaining the girls while Kirito is passed out on the Barco Lounge Chair with the kid and pet.
There's no better way to spend Christmas Eve than playing an MMO to catch a new update.

I bought a 12 pack. I still don't think that'll be enough.
Save some for me.
That's verging on a spoiler but I'm glad to hear it all the same.
be wary of the feels, therefore tissue required ahead.
[This comment has been removed]
Ah... The feels are coming back.

So, yeah, I totally want this game. Can't wait for this technology to be a real thing.
