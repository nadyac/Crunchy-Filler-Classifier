am I the only one impressed by that horse jump?
It was not only impressive, but most likely also impossible irl
Ah Sanosuke, such a bad-ass but at the same time a chicken xD
You get a like just for that awesome profile pic. Keep being awesome, that you should.
I like how the animators took liberties to experiment on angles, facial expressions and different movements.
"That thing will suck out our souls!" LOL
OH HOHOHOHOHOHHO
that laugh strikes again!
Kenshin managed to dry off, train a wild stallion, and catch up to a train in the 10 minutes he was gone. What an impressive individual gozaruna!~
Kenshin! Where'd you get that horse?!
LOL that horse sure is trained well
The real question is where he managed to get a horse and what happened to it after the train started moving again. Must be one of those they use in videogames, always hanging out offscreen until you call it, then it's right there.
The art seems different than previous episodes
I hope that photo does not get lose as the series goes.
Seeing that train fight reminded me of the train fight in Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter
"How could this happen? How could I be the only one with a gun in this whole heist, and never take any of the opportunities to shoot?!"
They didn't show it be the horse died.

Sanosuke ^___^ My favorite Character of the series 8D
