What? It's been 4 days since this became available. This is only episode 10 and no comments? APPRECIATE THE CLASSICS BAKA.
maybe they're trying to do holiday stuff. you know like traveling to hometowns, ski trips or warm/tropical weather trips and stuff like that.

Kono yaro, Baka yaro--Bee Sama.yeah!

I just joined 5 days ago and I promised that this would be the first anime that I finish! I appreciate that classics ^o^
So Sanosuke punched the big guy, the big guy fell and disappeared? Where did he go?
I love the 90's vibe this gives off. Especially using the same exact music every time Kenshin is a BADASS.
this makes me think of street fighter.
im back in retro mode! ready for some throwback
lol'd at second Yahiko dwarf-toss.
Im guessing that Streached wasn't the word they mean to use XD
Sano the Worf.

One of the most epic anime ever!
Yahiko can handle fodder grown ups, good to know.
Guessing whoever has the rights to this show is about to release a new bluray boxset?
as long as they re-master and resub it I'll buy it.
