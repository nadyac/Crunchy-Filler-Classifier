I love it when they put this much detail into the fighting.
I wonder if this episode was made by a different team... The animation style is different, there's solid black shadows and more details. I guess it takes much longer to produce, hence the incoming filler, but damn it looks amazing.
That was such a satisfying fight scene.
Yeah in the past there was "strategy" and actual fists... really brings it back
Same. Also...love the fact that they kept it simple. No flashy super ninja confusing ninjistu. Just mostly hand to hand combat, some kunai, and plenty of subtle hints at what they are mentally going through. More like this !
There always has been strategy, only they're using nuke-sized bombs instead of fists. #ThatEscalatedQuickly
That episode was beyond perfect... then I found out next week is a double filler... I wanna cry ._.
its such a shame that from here its just going to be the bad guys are wining... the good guys are wining! the bad guys are wining... and so on and so forth
Im not that pleased about the filler, although a double episode week is nice.
Well their introducing the story behind mecha naruto so yeah :D!!! for those fans getting naruto uns revolution
I saw the title of ep:377 and my mind died from taking 5hrs to realize its going to justify mecha-nauto
I still neither have any damn idea what this "Mecha-Naruto" is, nor do I want to. .__.
Sweet mother of Jesus! Kakashi and Obito
that fight was beyond beautiful. the lack of shading made it look dream like(it was purposeful). the choreography amazing. the cgi turns perfect. the melding of past and present... one of the best fight scenes ive seen in a long time
Animation for that fight scene was truly spectacular.
How is that a spoiler it was in the title?!?! AWESOME fight though!

I Agree this fight was amazing.Animation looked good too but i prefer Hunter x Hunter 2011 animation (example Gon VS Hisoka in Heavens Arena e.t.c) Kakashi vs Obito reminded me of KillerBee VS Sasuke, that was a good hand to hand fight too!
obito's a beast. he said " I'm going to borrow this" kick to the jaw thanks for the hand sign fire style!
That was the best part of the fight!
Obito spent all these years in order to get the finest bodily scales a Jyuubi can offer
And now he's never alone! He's got permanent friends inside him.
xD
Am I the only one that thought that ball was a Pokemon for a second?
I love how Obito is his own bad ass in that he's not simply Madra's b*tch.

I agree.
The fight between Kakashi and Obito should have HP bars at the top, because this feels like a video game.
This was a fantastic episode, that animation, that music. prob 1 of the best naruto episodes ive seen
That was the best. It was the best since Physics face!
Definitely one of the best episodes in the series. Amazing directing and animation.
The fourth is just awesome... sei remains useless. Poor guy...

"Not now Sai, were fighting a war here. Just go off to the corner and doodle or something. You like to doodle, right?"
lol why is everyone making fun of sai?
Cause he's the new sakura.
@redm4mb4 Lololo. The movies aren't canon. Nothing in them actually happened in the series. They're filler.
The fight scene between Obito and Kakashi was great. Also, JUUBITO.
Yay, Jewbito!
obishi !
yes it was like Awsome as fuck
SORRY 5 KAGES.BUT AFTER GETTING WASHED UP BY MADARA.... YOU ALL MIGHT ASWELL WATCH FROM A DISTANCE AND LET THE KIDS TAKE OVER. #SHAMBOLICAL
lol the kages are completely useless now :/

Definitely one of the best episodes since the beginning of the show 10 years ago
Me and my reaction to the last 5 mins "OH MY GOD, 10 tails is inside obito, SHIT. IS.ABOUT.TO.GO.DOWN......(preview starts playing).....f.f..f...f.f.f.......FILLER!?!!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Were gonna have two episodes next week so its fine
its a two part filler... and not the good kind of filler.... (yes there is a good kind) i hate side story fillers that have no relation to the real story.. >< (1st time flashbacks, not the repeats.., and informative r good)
I have mixed feelings about the bad type of fillers. I did laugh back when in one episode you see a long line to the bathroom and Itachi and Kisame were waiting patiently in line
But seriously... mecha Naruto... That's like Bolt doing aliens...
Its to promote the video game which comes out the following Tuesday... Gonna be hype


Only kids from the 90s (Bleach) will remember this.
@Lazyboy12346: you should put a spoiler on that... Though I don't need you to say it, I'm already assuming that... but you kinda ruined it for me by confirming it...
I miss my Bleach
Clorox or Tide?
Damn Sakura's fake smile was much creepier in the manga, it was trollface worthy lol
[This comment has been removed]
it was pretty much exactly the same?
HEY! LOOK, A NEW NARUTO EPISODE! aaaaaaaaaanddddddd its gone....
wow emotional fight well done T_T
OMG superb taijutsu animation! Last time we had a good taijutsu fight was Sasuke vs Killer Bee (Ep. 143) I'm so freaking happy to see it again!
Bro, Madara raping the shinobi alliance was amazing taijutsu as well.
^
i know. everyone is forgetting how amazing madara destroying the alliance was.
i first read that as "rapping the shinobi alliance" and was going to ask for links. lol
@Time2Warp I would watch an episode in which Madara punks the entire Shinobi Alliance through the power of rap.
Kakashi and Obito fight scene is epic as hell!
That ending... does this ever stop getting more serious?
No. Shit gets more real
way more real.. so many hidden clues in this episode alone...
Like what Omen?
Another filler episode with robot Naruto attacking the village (oh and its a double episode)
