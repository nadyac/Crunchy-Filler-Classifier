Aquarius looks like shew wants to kill someone LOL


Muahahaha, that's just the way She is! I look forward to seeing Her be summoned!
the clock guy was Horoglium
yea learn horologiums name. hes saves everyone at least once it seems

Tsunami Warning has been posted for next week. High water levels and dangerous waves will be heading in the direction of a wizard named Lucy. Seek higher ground immediately.
I thought her and scorpio were fighting as well... Things are gonna be interesting next episode :S
aquarius' got some grudge going vs mr odd-looking-says-tai.. thats my bet ^^
Not to mention summoning her from a random/dirty place.
At least it wasn't a puddle this time!
Totally loved this episode! I am sensing some relationship issues between a certain celestial couple of Lucy's o.O...which hints are some pretty funny stuff next week!
I predict Lucy is going to get some butt-hurt next week if that look Scorpio gave Lucy is any indication of Aquarious's mental state. :-P
Is it just me or is Scorpio acting a little... weird? O_o
yeah, he was probably on a date with aquarius and knows she's gonna go crazy
I'm ready to see Erza kick all the ass!
I am totally going to buy a strawberry cake to celebrate her awesomeness too!
OOOh can't wait for Erza to kick ass
Erza's fight with Minerva is one of the most amazing fights I've read in any manga, cant wait to see it in anime form now, especially with the new art style

I notice a severe lack of spoiler tags on that last comment.
Loki was flirtier than usual, gotta hand it too him xD
I concur
Loke is still the same old big flirt, Virgo's dancing is still useless & Taurus cant help but want to rape that "Lucy, Nice Body!" xD
Also, apparently he can see her even when he's not actually present. That's... disconcerting.
Arcadios got some serious iron balls to get that lava. Respect sir
Even if trying to stretch the duration he can last, he should've at least lost his feet. Plenty of the body, at least blood, would outright rapidly evaporate in that situation.
in fact there is an explanation why he didnt burn XD hes got the necklace from the dragon spirit we saw sooner , he picked it around the bones
Much high earned respect to Arcadios but poor Horologium is about to burst if someone doesn't take Arcadios out of him xP
@jadeakl Yeah I was wondering if Horologium was gonna explode or something. Poor guy
Realistically, they should have caught on fire from going anywhere near the magma. But that's no fun, and since when has Fairy Tail ever been realistic?
toasty warm butt is a nice feeling
13:12 - 14:00 ROFLMAO!!!
DAT LOKI LOGIC.
I never noticed the ears before either ><
They've gone with a new art style with the new series. He always had those ears but they looked a lot more like hair spikes in the earlier series
They changed the designs slightly since last season, like how the pumpkin guys face is different too
That panty shot... we missed it, darn it-tai!
Loke is one of my favorite Celestial Spirits! Along with Aquarius
Seriosuly though what the hell Cosmos? This thing you have for Wendy is beyond creepy. And I thought Mest's infatuation with her was bad
Cancer is too apparently...
@falafelraptor Wenco I like that
well cosmos likes cute things (or maybe just cute girls) so her affection(or whatever it is) towards Wendy is completely understandable
Well, these executioners seem to be technically good guys, despite their bizarre behavior and opposing mission. I think we'll get to see more of Cosmos after all this.

Then say I'm doin' a job and a building happens to be destroyed, or I storm into the Council's chambers. Does that count as a sin? No...that always happens. So very true, I couldn't help but chuckle.
well what's a fellow mage of destruction suppose to say? oh ya thats why your a sinner cept on my execution jobs that's happened to me like 500 times....
They gave loki cat ears... I like it
i don't like it, he didn't need em before and still doesn't
Well, he already had them in the manga
He had it before the new episodes ! :O
i don't remember him having lion in the previous episodes, but still i kinda liked it looks bad ass
Lo-Lo-Loki has neko ears?! KAWAII!!
As always Aquarius looks pissed xD
COME FORTH!! She who hates any and all things Lucy-based!!!! DESTROY EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!
You used the wrong element there-tai

I thought of what happened in the manga too and then I got all sad-like and whatnot.

of course you can't remember it if it was so long ago.... because it was this weeks chapter.
-WAILS- TT_TT
I read the manga but WHAT DO I NOT KNOW!!!!
That's cold tai....This guy is a funny man!
forget about the water cause your in deep shit when she calls Aquarius.
I just want to add that Aquarius maybe piss at Lucy for Losing her key again lol
Well, good thing the execution has two toilets running...

Guy jumps in lava, doesnt burn to death . . . . .sting punches his guild master and he died . . . .the logic
