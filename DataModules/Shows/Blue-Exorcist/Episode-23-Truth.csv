Well, for your first question, either would have done, only Yukio had enough weakness in his soul that Satan could easily take him over.
ALL THE FEELS!!!
The FEELS! They're EVERYWHERE!
I loved their mother... She saw things so differently.
Yes I do like how she saw things, but why the hell would you have it with Satan?
Satan, I think, is a pedophile, she was like 12 it looks like
Makes me feal sad for Satan. He just didn't understand life and maby he just wants revenge for Yuri's death.
Well, when You're Satan, I guess it doesn't matter WHAT terrible things You do...I mean after all, You ARE Satan...The EPITOME of ALL EVIL...bahaha. XD
@Chinothebamf That's hot. I mean, given the flames and all...
stupid fuck face of a grandfather!
idr
Fenris...it's the internet. Not much can be done about it.
the fucking grandfather is messed up
well put

Well shit.
I can't figure Satan out, in the flashback he was trying to save Yuri (good action), but he's also been trying to find a body (bad action). still hope Rin kicks his ass though
i want a life too satan....i want a life too...
Who needs a life when you have anime
@Feia20032 so true, lol
Hear hear, Feia! <3
This episode kinda made me like Satan. :/
[This comment has been removed]

I felt sorry for him. He may be kinda crazy but he was just lonely. When you think about it he's kinda like Midas of the golden touch, burns everything he touches.
or the skittles guy
Or the Heat Miser! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_Miser
I HATE THE GRANDFATHER SOOOOOOOO MUCH I HOPE HE DIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No, his fate will be one much worse than death. He just got pulled into basically hell with a mortal body. Yeah, nothing fun's in store for him.

Hm, I like this anime, but dang, a very different perspective of Satan. O_o
ikr
It's awesome the way it's done, though...<3
Still a better love story than twilight!
syra456, do you mean twilight is to awsome, or blue exorcist??? Blue Exorcist TOTALLY OUTRANKS twilight!!!
Twilight is TRASH!!!!!! D:{
no vampires
Vampires shouldn't sparkle.
i wanna fall in love with the devil like how cool
"What in tarnation?" Interesting translation. And they sure gave Satan a closed off from the world lonely type. Then he went back to being a douche. Guess it was all deception from the get go. That's the devil for ya
No, he was always like that, but their mom made him feel alive, so he fell in love with her. He was never calm, it was more like fascinated with their mom.
It's a good representation of how the so called Good guys can carry out the Evil's plans unknowingly. Their firm beliefs of one sided purity are just as bad as Satan's dream of the two worlds becoming one.
Or maybe he just went all batshit crazy after they killed her? o.o
@kazuma1982 i pretty much read your whole comment in rhythm because your first 2 sentences rhymed i thought you should know
The grandfather is NUTS
that awkward momment when satans a girl
Why the fuck do they place the ads where the episode is at its climax... -__-"
^lol fail...


well guys we have about 22 people that are at least 40 and still live with their parents up in here
Claiming there is nothing to watch in the comments section for the anime you just binged on. Have you considered a career as a brain surgeon or rocket scientist?
yuri is the most fantastic heroine!
I don't know how anyone could feel bad for Satan. Using a young girl, who's only fault was being passionate, to bear his children so that he could ultimately possess them to control the world. Yea, that warrants so much pity.

Darkness is simply the lack of Light. How do you remove darkness? Shine Light on it.
Oh god this episode was the most climactic so far, i got waaay too into it lol
Absolutely My Friend! Same here!
I hope that so called "grandfather" has a nice time in hell. Bastard...
Hell Yes! Good riddance!
Are they seriously humanizing satan, ahh those crazy japanese
Rin having demonic powers is just so ^_^
BAD ASS, right? =D
