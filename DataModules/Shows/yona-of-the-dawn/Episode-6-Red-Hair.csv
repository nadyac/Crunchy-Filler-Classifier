"I'm just a passing, handsome boy, so you don't have to remember me." Dude, I don't think that's possible after the word "handsome."
I also prefer the "pretty boy" translation. Since he's specifically using in the "so pretty you could pass for a girl" context. (And yes, Yoon is the best. This is an objective fact.)
He says bishounen which is pretty much "pretty boy". I guess the translators thought handsome sounded better flow wise or something.
agreed, he did say 'bishounen' meaning beautiful boy. as contrast to bishoujo 'beautiful girl'.
New pickup line acquired.
The problem is, "handsome" doesn't even flow that well with the rest of the sentence.
"This place is full of annoying people." The new wind tribe general is Hak 2.0, I see.
Because you cannot nap and chill in a noisy place. -Wind Tribe

that is so true

i did not notice that in like every other anime i've watched
Achievement Unlocked: "Hairy Situation" +20 rage, +30 courage, - long hair, +Luigi Death Stare. Bonus: Fear in the enemies' eyes.
lol
IDK full badass would have stabbed him rather than, or in addition to, cutting the hair.
One level at a time Taro.
I expected her to cut his head off I was dissapointed
I'm happy knowing that she at least will change a lot as a character considering episode 1. Now I can just lean back and not be worried about that and enjoy ;D

Its so awesome to have the heroine in a show like this be this determined! I'm so excited to see how this anime plays out!
Did you forget the last episodes she just became like this
"He is so devoted, is he your lover?" Yona, "No, he isn't." "I feel bad for this guy". Your not the only who feels bad for Hak
A moment of silence for our brethren in the friendzone.
Rest in friendzones
She should have cut his arm off not her hair.
I think she tried to cut the arm, but missed and cut her hair
wheezy's opinion is sounding most plausible
I don't think she was aiming for anything in particular considering she'd never held a weapon before. I think she was just swinging and hoping to hit something
The scene reminds me of Sakura during chuunin exam, when she tried to cut her hair due to Kin (Otogakure) was holding it. I think, this should be a trend for girls in anime... (lol)
Because she is too kind...
Hak: you wan't me right? *gets in Suu Won's face* me: 0_0
I'm sure Yona would approve
your profile pic is probably the face she would make
Yaoi moment. >:D
If Suu-won doesnt want him, pleeeease send him to me!! I could think of a hundred ways to enjoy a Thunder Beast like him!!
Well, this episode made me wanting more!
I think the next episode is really going to spell things out for us, how could it not with a title like destiny!
Doesn't every episode make us want more?
This show is so satisfying! I need moar now! This gives me way more ATLA feels than LOK ever could.
Hak is a boss.
I like how by the end Hak was swinging wildly and relied on brute strength instead of the finesse and skill he displayed at the beginning. It was a good touch to show both his current exhaustion and innate strength at the same time.
The way he moved was really well animated, idk if it's the director or some kind of animator choreographer, but whoever is in charge of that deserves major props.
Hey princess, I think you got something in your eyes. You may want to see a doctor because flaming cataracts can't be good for your vision.
I can't *not* watch this show's intro....every. single. week. XD
Every week I get to the opening and go "I'm just going to skip this" but my hands never move to click ahead. I just love it so much.
It's pretty epic, that's true.
There are some you just can't skip.
@tsuchidoll, most of them you mean. There aren't many that are bad enough to be worth skipping. Some though, are just perfect.
I don't really like it that much,it doesn't have that much "oomph" xD
Dear lord look at that animation! This is one of my favorite manga ever and I'm so glad they adapted it in such a way! This is everything you could ever want! Look at those smooth movements!
Any scenes with Hak fighting are just beautifully sleek. This adaptation is really doing the manga justice!!

Maybe they were at 15f? (Humanity Has Declined)
@rjjourneyd1978 plucked chickens say to go in an endless loop.
Goodbye, long hair, hello, new road to destiny!
Watching Hak fight I sometimes feel like I'm playing Dynasty Warriors.
LOL "Is he your lover" "No, not at all!" It's ok, Hak, if Yona doesn't want you, I'm always available...
Tae-jun may be a selfish dick, but he genuinely cared for Yona as more than just a meal ticket. In my eyes, that has always redeemed him somewhat, though I'm not sure if he deserves it.
Your words are as kind as Yona. But remember, with Tae-jun's father and his ambitions, he is also weak as well.

Hak:"You idiot! Why'd you come out?!" Yona: "Cuz I had to penance stare this fire nation bitch."
Use fire vs fire, throw in some winds... massive fire.
