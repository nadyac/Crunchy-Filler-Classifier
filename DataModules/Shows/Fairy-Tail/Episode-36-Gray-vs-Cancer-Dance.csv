Lucy and Virgo's "punishment" scene was great lol freaking adorable xD
love your picture c; shiiaiananaaaa
Gray is a smooth criminal on the dance floor.
everybody is gay for gray <3
cancer is a fangirl
"You can do whatever you want to me." LMAO Cancer swooned lol.
I was expecting a 50 dances of Gray move, honestly lol
This was too much I couldn't take it-it's too hilarious seeing Gray dance!
LOL.. Juvia's sixth sense is telling her something truly amazing is happening
If Juvia had been there for that dance-off, she would have had an aneurysm. It would simply have been too much Gray for her to handle.
its so funny as soon as i read monyb93 comment i see that part
I think Juvia would have butted in and tried killing Cancer for that... Or she would try to force him to do it again for her.
"Hey Juvia, we're trying to keep the dance floor dry, so whatever you're doing needs to stop..."
Did Cancer just have an "o" watching Gray dance-cause I got that impression. Gray-making all the ladies pregnant
Lol, that moment when Virgo realizes Lucy is enjoying herself no matter what she does.
that means Lucy's a true masochist XD
I was laughing during the entire battle between Cancer and Gray. 9/10 dancing Grays.
there was a lot of rainbows in that dance sequence that much is certain.
MJ Lives on!
What did I watch...
Smooth Criminal Gray-sama kani!
My sides hurt from watching this fight.

ice ice baby.....
XD ROFL oh god, my sides....
i can't stop laughing, you win
well... you win the internet. XD
Who knew Lucy was really a sadomasochist...? The future of Fairy Tail looks quite interesting... O_o!
Well with all the crazy stuff they've all been through its no wonder their all a little messed up.
Why does my zodiac sign have to be so weird...


i like how that is exactly what would happen if gildarts was there
I activate the card !st Master's Rage
I'm willing to bet cancer has Gray's performance recorded and it'll turn up somewhere towards the end of this arc when they are back at the guild....
Well, Hisui and Arcadios were watching the different fights, so....maybe?
^ he said what i was thinking. Cancer doesnt have to tell anyone. Hisui and Arcadios witnessed it and Juvia sensed something happened
Well now we know why he won't date juvia........ he's got cancer XD

Gray Wat r u doin? GRAY STAHP!
Lesson Learned...When in doubt, go to Gildarts!!!
reading through the comments and noticing how many people don't understand that the symbol on Cancer's belt buckle is his zodiac sign and not actually 69 is actually really disappointing
Reading through the comments and seeing how many people don't get that it is still a 69 is disappointing. It's a joke to bad you didn't get it.
my one question is this. Where did Gray's hat come from?
"Icy" what you did there.
did grey just drop some mj?
I think Cancer just became Juvia's biggest competition.
