I can't wait to find out what's hidden within the basement.



Spoilers are ONLY for this episode SoulZC. Also, Dburke267 too. Please delete those comments so nobody gets the show ruined for them.
Natsu_-_Dragneel i read all of those spoiler comments expecting it to be something related to this episode and I'm watching this anime for the first time Legit just trying to forget what i read ffs
Every time I watch the opening to Attack on Titan I get goosebumps.
lol this show is still the best I have ever seen
Im digging this so far. It was a tear jerker to see his mom like that
@ninja_clint i know right when i saw that i started tearing up

@MenzyBee: It's okay. I have cried watching this anime as well, so you're not the only one. I will say this anime is on my top 5
Attack on Titans and Gargantia on the Verounous Planet a perfect right left combo for spring!
@AnimeVocaloidGirl ....You stole my avatar....
Ikr rentadawg
1 problem. Gargantia ended. Sadly.


Episode 1 set the hate, 2 set the desire, 3 looks the be the means for revenge, then time to kill these Titans, chop them all up, hall them back in parts and make them your lunch.
Everything the human body needs... is in the human body. Just watch out for prion disease~
Waiter- "So our special is the armored titan, use your "grills" kids or you'll totally fuck your teeth up... We also have creepy pedophile smiling titan's ribs?" The father-"Uhm...no thanks..... c'mon kids, lets get the hell outta here"
Some of those giants were tiny! Hmm, a day in the life of a tiny giant: "I wish i was a little bit taller.."
Sounds like we're supposed to breed humanity to be like Hannibal.
one titan can actally feed many ppl, but watch out for giant poop in thir giant intestine
OMG where's Kratos when you need him??
Having not watch anime for a good while and coming back to this....Oh man were have you been all my life?
Lolz I love the Kratos Thing!
Who even is kratos -_- sorry if im being nooby anyway if you going to summen someone.... WHERE THE HELL IS CHUCK NORRIS,godzillla would do thow lol
i begged to differ, if we are getting anyone its gonna be batman
God of War 4: Attack on Titan x Kratos
Is it too early to start a Mikasa fanclub?
Rule 34 has that taken care of my friend:)
Okay I'll bite, what's Rule 34?
Aleshanation, Rule 34: If it exists there is a porn of it.

Man this anime's soundtrack is amazing!!!
if there was a Gundam in the basement, dad would have died and he would have gotten in it ep 1.
Don't you think it would be more likely that he is some kind of genetic experiment from his old man, aka the hulk?
He is a coordinator and there is titan fighting gear in the basement. Sorry, I couldn't help the Seed reference. You guys set it up too perfectly. But seriously, that dream seemed more like a memory. Dad's up to something.
the dads a pedo and it was a repressed memory :O
@beubanks7507: Lol, loved the Seed reference there! XD Love your avatar too, and I agree with you on thinking that that dream seemed more like a memory.
this anime has THE MOST EPIC OPENING EVERRRRRR
It gives me goosebumps before the actual show gives me goosebumps!
I agree to @jeref89, I love watching OP and ED. Without them I feel something lacking in the anime. But sometime it depend how to made by creator.
One of the Cool things about Bleach was they would change the open and ending between chapters. Usually the music was pretty good and animations always had characters doing intersting things you wouldnt normally see them doing.
The only person that didn't give this anime a 5 star review (the only 3 start) complained that the opening gave out too many hints of whats happening later on in the show... like wtf asshole -.-
it's better than llamas
they need an underground escape.... seriously... what could the dumb retarded giants do about people who escape to underground.
If they could do that then they probably already would have. To dig under the wall.
That's quite a lot to dig. You know how ants can carry 10-50 times their own weight, while we have to lift our own bodies and whatever we're lifting, giants aren't strong for their size like humans are for their size. Too much work.
Dude, the Titans would collapse the underground escape. If that giant titan was over 50 meters tall, who the hell knows how much it weighs!
Yeah, but it isn't like it is impossible to live underground. They would just need a foundation to stabilize the weight above them. Plus, there are already caves made by nature below too.
@Grayson14508 Let's hope he doesn't have a McDonalds addiction..
Dammit, who let the anatomy models escape
Lol,i was thinking the same thing!
ummm... must be someone who attends a school for giants??
lol ikr
The reason titans have that giant grin is that they walk around naked everywhere and no one can stop them!
Can see Eren going genocidal, killing Titan babies and stuff.
They sacrificed so many :S
finally an anime that has a character that actually gets angry and dark when they should...wow hes actually human what a shock...

I'm sorry. I don't know why this comment makes me so mad, but it does. It really does. If this is "the only anime that has a character that gets angry when they should", you haven't watched enough anime my friend. Even happens in Naruto.
@animeloverr2 True, but they usually bounce back so fast it is like it never happened!
I want them to make him psychotic
Mikasa...you so cool xD my fave character in this show after these first 2 eps, she's got the situation under control for sure
They didnt think SAO would have incest either....look how that turned out
definitely an INFJ
She is complete badass in its purest form. I can't wait to watch her and Eren work together to kill some titans.
Mikasa will hulk smash the titans.

Wow, watching that Titan charge like that reminds me of Football. Breaking it down!
I thought it looked like a giant Tyrant from RE.
the titan running reminded me of neon genesis
When I saw the titan running, I think i said something along the lines of "OH DEAR GOD! The titans have FOOTBALL PLAYERS!?!"
I was hesitating to watch this because I thought it would be all hype and no delivery. Now I feel like an idiot for waiting because this show is awesome.
Same here!
Me to!!
I made that mistake too my friend

The smiles are friggin terrifying!! **Nightmares**
Tell me about it. I don't think I'm gonna sleep well tonight. :/

To be perfectly honest, I am almost 100% sure this is going to end in the genocide of either the human race, or the Titan race... Welcome to the Titan Games!! May the odds be ever in your favor! :|

They dumbed down the Titan detail from the manga. You'd be treated to some horrible female anatomy had they not wash-boarded them all. They also censored this a lot from manga. The Titans din din time is not so artistically done. Still epic
what chapter is the manga up to now?
Looks like 44.
It's not often that you see a female mixed with a male lead with actual strength.
