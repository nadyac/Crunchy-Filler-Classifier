THE MUSIC IN THIS ANIME ALWAYS GETS TO ME!
Especially that little slow tune at the endings before the credits.
haha same here.. Its so nice
it really is
Aye!

For once Natsu's actually going to end up praised for destroying something rather than pissing off everyone around him. xD
about destroying the anti magic, magic absorbing door. Atlas flames fire is anti magic, and natsu/atlas flame blasted a huge ??? ton admantium dragon into the door from who knows how high. thats pretty darn devestating..
Natsu will still be sent the invoice for obliterating the castle though. lol
well, and a good chunk of the city and surrounding areas....
If doing that stops that happening in the first place wouldn't that mean that thing with ul would've never happened?



i cried
As much as I hate to agree, that was the afterlife... Alternate-future Natsu never heard Lucy's final words about wanting to keep adventuring. Present Lucy felt her counterpart is finally resting in peace which is why she cried. :'(
Also she got her right arm back, the credits sequence also shows how Alternate-future Lucy is crying at looking at her returned Fairy Tail mark on her hand.

Dragon Flies?? no?? anyone??
The magic does come from nowhere. where other shows have consistent power levels, fairy tail fluctuates to make it feel more exciting. it's cheap and annoying. also how is Takilyn a hypocrite? everything he said was accurate.
So let me get this right... You're arguing magic, a defined means that defies conventional logic, is not being logical in sudden power boosts? When the show has established to this point that emotions can influence that magic power?

It makes sense they didn't do all that great at killing the dragons I don't think any of them have been fully trained and the only experience they have with dragons besides Acnologia who is the most powerful dragon is with their dragon
WHAT DID ROGUE SAY TO NATSU DAMMIT!! I WANT TO KNOW!!


Obviously it'll be Romeo who does Frosch in. Why, I never trusted that delinquent.
@Ipnintendo aren't they speaking in japanese? you can lip read japanese?

That ending made my day:-)
That ending was hard to watch. It was a strong feelin this time.
I used to ship Lisanna but now I am 100% NaLu. It just feels right.
I still prefer Lisanna but that is mostly because I'm tired of the childhood friend getting pushed aside for the new girl. Just once can't growing up together actually mean something! But I have to admit I can't hate NaLu.
I'm still broken from last week poor Ultear
she definitely deserves a monument and honorary stamp as a fairy tale member R.I.P. Ultear
"I'm not the same man who kept a cat as a sidekick". Anyone else wanted to punch this Shadow Rogue in the face?
I wanted to punch him in the balls... with a chainsaw... but that was since he killed Lucy.
I think the "Shadow" killed Lucy, he's pretty much possessed and his little anger turned to FULL OUT SHADOW CONTROLLED HATRED!
Damn it Rogue, they aren't sidekicks! they are partners!
XD can't wait for next Friday.
Don't forget Akame ga Kill Sunday. WELL I'M SORRY AKAME GA KILL DOESN'T START WITH S D:
and hunter x hunter... tuesday? and RWBY thursday?
Too bad Hunter X Hunter will be taking it's leave soon ):
Yeah My tuesdays will never be the same ..
For me it's SAO! And this. Maybe I'll start a few more Animes? I did just buy yesterday the 1 year Premium. I don't know the days they come out, I just watch the numbers of days go down slowly.
laughing once a days is good for your heart! I say seeing Lucy crying of of happiness is good for your heart as well!
It's really obvious there has been at least a little budget issues cause the animation is less epic in fights but Fairy Tail is still Fairy Tail and it is still wonderful. Never fails to make me tear up :') NaLu!!!!!!
It's always been like that. The anime is really subpar but I've invested so much time, might as well keep going.
No way man, I've watched it all and the fight scenes and emotional scenes were always incredible and epic. Imo though.
I guess I wasn't the only one that noticed the animation being slightly significantly off-model in this episode? Especially when Cubellios turns her heard. Or Elfman's head. Gah, his head!
More to the point, they reused that scene from the original future battle between Natsu and the dragons for absolutely no reason at all other than to waste time.
Only Natsu could single-handedly cause that much destruction =P
Accidentally too.
That's what Fairy Tail mages are all about ^_^
Yeah, I thought I was the only one who as soon as Arcadios said, "...It won't be easy to destroy..." immediately thought, "just bring Natsu to fight around it for a while, I'm sure it'll go down eventually." LOL it actually did!!!
I wasn't thinking natsu so much as "if magic doesn't work drop a dragon on it"

Fairy Tail Episode 23: Directed by Michael Bay
Finally this Arc is Over now the good thing is coming with the Tartarous Arc we would get everything on the next Arc Action, death, power ups, good fights and lots of fan service
There will be at least 30 more episodes.
They usually use stuff like that for filler so I wouldn't be surprised if they did and Grayfullbust3r I don't have any idea what you're talking about I really enjoyed this arc and had been waiting for it for a long long time.
Eh, Tartaros is an okay arc, I think fans overrate it a bit though. There's some cool action, but their isn't much structure to it and it just kind of feels like one huge climax
TheKidUzumaki Ha Ha........ 30? You Say? This'll never END! SAO ended....... I was Sad. Angel Beats Ended. I Cried and My heart was Broken. But at least SAO is back right?
I think this arc is probably the beginning of the end for this series. There might be some small arcs in between before the finale.
Honestly even though this arc had its ups and downs the ending kind of made me tear up a bit. Rough along the way but a good way to end the Grand Magic Games. Go Fairy Tail!!!
Natsu and Lucy need to make babies already, perfect ending. Fairy Tail Series 3?
I wonder if the babies could inherit dragon slayer powers :O! Dragon spirits!
Was the fight as epic as I expect...No. But did it deliver? You betcha! Seeing future Lucy cry of sheer happiness after seeing gang after who knows how long...Yeah it brought tears to my eyes! LucyxNatsu quit beating around the bush already

E.N.D(Evil Natsu Dragoneel), Achnoligia, or Zaref, it has to be one of those three
