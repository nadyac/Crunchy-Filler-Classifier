Madara is the only character on earth that lost his eyes, lost his ability to be invincible and still got stronger.
Not exactly, Yuutang, the 1st Hokage and maybe others would likely become stronger too. When they're resurrected, they say they're stronger than Orochimaru's resurrections, but they don't specifically say they're back to their original str
or it's cuz you can't be the jinjuriki of the ten tails unless your alive... and he likes the thrill of battle


Never underestimate the power of plot armor.


Spoiler much?
Maybe you don't need any eyes, see their original words: "given to those who have activated mangekyo sharingan in both their eyes" They don't say you need to still have those eyes. But see Kakashi activated at least 1 eye, if not both.
It actually states when Sasuke first gets his that the only way you can use Susano'o is if you have the Mangekyo Sharingan unlocked in both eyes. Its also supposed to make you go blind if you keep using it, unless you steal a relatives eyes
Some of you people are just being plain silly and stubborn. In earlier episodes when Sasuke overused his "Visual Prowess" he lost the ability to form susanoo and grabbed his eye like it was throbbing, ASIDE FROM THAT, They screwed this up..
did anyone else cry when the part of the old man showed omg i tired it was very heart warming
Very nice scene.
That old man rocks

at 6:01 is like the revenge of tails beasts on Madara
It was an amazing scene
KAKASHI used POKe BALL! ... Oh no! The GEDO broke free!
Madara was able to capture the Tailed Beasts because he uses cheat codes. Kakashi should try that.
A+B+down is not a cheat code, it's a skill!
Up+Up+Down+Down+Left+Right+Left+Right+B+A Infinite Masterballs Go get em Kakashi!!
Gotta catch'em all!
Its interesting
Lol, now even Gara's tailed beast shikaku is having flashbacks!
yeah, i think it was done to show u that even he is starting to love humans too.

Nothing gets past you Ellie
Now I can see why Gaara was so messed up as a kid. Shukaku was always... well... a little off.

I like how everyone says they like something stupid, not saying that im not part of everybody. English is weird.
the only reason madara survived is because of plot no jutsu.. the tailed beasts could have easily killed him by just firing some tailed beast bombs.
Also where the hell was Sasuke here? It's unrealistic that during the whole battle scene he'd just sit back and watch while all that went on.... So yes this episode is full of plot holes
You'll see where Sasuke and most of the others were in the next episode.
@VickyViviVicci madara doesnt have the unique ability to absorb chakra. all he did was absorb nature chakra from hashi, and he didn't absorb the amaterasu, his armor protected him. he needs rinnegan to truly absorb chakra..
lmfao "plot no jutsu"
HAHAH lol... plot no jutsu...
Did it have to end there? Ugh, cliffhangers.
You're surprised that it ended on a cliffhanger? I've come to accept them as being normal. In fact, I think it's proper name is Cliffhanger-no-jutsu...
Next weeks episode is on christmas and its going to be a good one. I cant wait!!
Well, I watched it on a diff website and I really hate to do this but, Naruto and Sasuke almost di-
Tailed Beasts use: Tail Whip It's not very effective...
The Anime-No-Jutsu is effective... There is no reason why Madara's survival up till now should be possible. I'm not saying the dude doesn't have mad skills and powers, but come on. Fighting all 9 tailed beasts, sasuke/Naruto, and the 1st
Sai was also there, sorta, kinda, not really...
Wait until you see which single fighter puts up the hardest fight. Can't wait.
@xanxa I seriously love that fight, its really good in its own way I dont know how will they animate it but cant wait to see that
HOW THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSE TO KILL THIS GUY!!!!!

Guess passes, enjoy. :] L953FPW75UN AD773XPXPSD GJHNHUCKEH9
Thanks! I took the last.
Based on this episode, guess all the tailed beasts will eventually have these damn flashbacks now. Just in time for Christmas enjoy guest passes: 3MJSPV7VDKW X5AZ83BLR37
F6XUSBE7VHY 966QCQF6LP6 happy holidays yall
thx!!!
That shock on Naruto's face when he thinks his indomitable Talk no Jutsu failed.
I guess Sasuke was still lost in that smoke jutsu
OMFG NEXT WEEK THOUGH, I READ THE MANGA SO IM NOT GONNA SPOIL IT, NEXT WEEK IS THE SHIT!
FUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK WHY DO THEY ALWAYS DO THIS LOL
