lol thats definitely Sa-chan. love how almost all the Gintama voice actors are in this show. Sa-chan u bat crazy (o3o)/
Love gintama i should probably finish watching it lol on the side note This chick is fking crazy
miranda...is...nuts.. XD
I watched Gintama at first, but after the second or third season I stopped watching, it wasn't funny anymore. I wanted it to be a little more serious.
"im looking for a timemachine" such an early yet hilarious joke
Gintama is a bit boring at first honestly, but it takes awhile to get accustomed to and into. There are a ton of characters in there, and many of them are given a background story which is really good. My favorite arc was about Hosen/Yato
Kon singing the theme song was a nice touch
Variation did the ending too. That was equally funny.
And I thought that something was wrong with the opening theme as it sounded differently. xD
Best reason for wanting to live. Forgetting to delete your search history.
we finally saw his/her boobs!!! woooooo
Sexy transgender for sure
heartbreakingly good looking transgender
I'd hit it.
So would I. o_O
you do realise that u would have to go in the backdoor...and ur gay... im just saying
crazy to a whole new level
Miranda is totally nuts. I like her! I hope she becomes a recuring character. A show this nuts needs a character as insane as she is. Imagine the havoc she'd wreak if she fell for Erec and the bishies one after the other.
Imagining that hurts my brain....
Kon finally learned this episode that you just can't fight crazy.
like a natural disaster on two legs. how unfortunate for anyone that gets caught up in her wake.
how can such lovely lumps of goodness belong to a man?
Magic, that's how, glorious sexy magic.
AWwwwwwwwwwww NOOhohohohoho what special programming was more special than this !!!
New years apparently :(.
I don't care if she's cute/hot, she's INSANE! DO NOT WANT! *runs away ASAP*

I agree. I get the sneaking idea that Miranda is going to follow them though.
Wow! A prime example of Grandiose delusions disorder.
Seriously! Gives some serious insight on how crazies' thought process is.
Somehow I want to punch that girl in the face like there no tomorrow.... She so creepy and she a stalker o.O"
just like sarutobi from gintama...except a lot more physically violent.
i see that tsunderes really do annoy the living crap out of me. miranda had better not ever appear in another episode again. unless kon is beating her to a bloody pulp. :-D.
Man, what an annoying new character
Miranda is very annoying and Kon need to kick her in the balls.
there goes my sunday funday >.>
Crazy chick!
the opening... I love soo much
More Miranda please
