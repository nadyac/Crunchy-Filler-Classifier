It's like watching a bunch of rhinos with them noses.
Don't forget about their pointy ears!
omg you people are going to make me choke laughing and snacking.
They are just like trolls!
the nose is a lot better than the "3" face in world trigger.
I hate those 3 line eyes with a passion
So he doesn't have time to get to Aoko's house but, he's got time to set up fire works and program a building's lights?
But which one was better?

he could have given her a good birthday present though, just something small, like her cherry
He set up the lights beforehand. He was just going to be there and show them to her, but he ended up calling.
He didn't program the building it was a projector.
So let's see, Nakamori blows off his family (despite apparently being a single father) and wastes how many millions of yen in tax money trying to catch a glorified vandal (since Kid never actually steals what he takes). What a prize idiot.
Police pride. Also, take a look at the Conan movie "Last Wizard of the Century". They mention how much he's stolen in value. It's a LOT.
All that window replacement can't be cheap XD .

Magic Kaito has such a great opening. Love it.

I wish Crunchyroll had an edit button. *ahem* Agasa is typically too nice and will gladly give away his inventions (typically because they go boom or malfunction, so he doesn't want that coming back on him in a monetized way).
He actually monetized the voice modifier he made for Conan (because it proved to actually work successfully), but it was pulled because it could be linked back to Conan and put their lives in danger.
He made it into a Kamen Yaiba mask, where it was locked into Yaiba's voice print, but all a very smart enemy had to do was see who created the mask, link them back to a suspiciously smart kid that appeared after Shinichi disappeared and...
I'm not sure it actually makes sense. Agasa should be able to recognize his gadgets being used in high profile heists, and realize it's only the gadgets he gives to a certain friend of his. There's no reason for him to keep quiet about it.
BTW 1412=KID

Did anyone catch Hiroshi Agasa's car @ 4:38. I love all these detective conan easter eggs XD

Pay more attention to the dialogue, Kaito implies he set it all up earlier. He just wanted to be physically preset when it happened, which he wasn't able to be.
can payphones even be called?
The real question is do payphones even still exist?
^ wats a payphone? l0l
Last time I saw a payphone it was a few months ago @ Disney's Animal Kingdom & yes if you know the number you can call the phone in the beginning. But the ringer may be disabled or incoming call service might be disabled nowadays.
Awwww that's awesome.
I really hope Conan or the Black Origination have a few episodes over here
dude is that agasa hakase's car at 4:39??????
At 4:35, why does it cut to the shot of the car? Is it to tease that Kaito is being watched? If so, that seems a tad out of place.
Usopp? IS THAT YOU!?!
I wish my dad was Char Aznable.... Kaito is lucky....
This is great! I've never seen detective Conan nor do I plan to because of the 100s of episodes there are and the little time that I have, but man is this a good alternative.
Not to mention the number of movies....but you should, it's a good show. I say that, even though I'm behind by about 300 or so episodes....

kaito is really mean but once in a while he does something nice
