I laughed so hard at Juvia and Cheria fighting

@Oldthrashbar Why are you still watching this anime. nearly episode you've had something bad to say??
@pitty93 maybe he likes predictable anime.
@Oldthrashbar "Predictable"? I don't know about you but all these twists with Kagura, future Lucy, and basically everything, has got me on the edge of my seat with a heart attack waiting to happen. This is anything but predictable. -_-
he is being sarcastic
I feel like fairytail wizards don't fight at 100% until they have to...
@AnamixBlade One Piece isnt very much like that at all. Mostly because theyre not put into situations like that. Except for that one part on Sabody where everyone gets wrecked but they lost that fight
lazy bastards
Really does ANY Anime character...? I mean C'mon.
@AnamixBlade well, who won't go all out if you saw someone close to you get hurt? It doesn't have to be explained by anime logic.
I think they do but then their spirit boosts their fight up to like 200%
Minerva doesn't just cross Erza's moral event horizon, she dances across it juggling baby heads while giggling.
yeah, but what's with the cheap gimmicks? why did they have to make it seem like Erza was at the very least cut by Kagura in the last scene of the previous episode? completely unnecessary. '-_-

I stopped reading, thanks for mentioning it iAge =)

She's in"cut a bitch" mode
There is badass.. then there is epic badass-ness... then there is Erza-I-Will-End-Your-World-Cause-You-Made-Me-Mad badass-ness...... and the angels wept....
Eh, I bet Morgiana could take her. Who else is for a Magi/Fairy Tail crossover?
It would indeed be interesting, but Morgiana doesn't hold a candle on Erza imo.
I'm saying that Kagura from Gintama could wipe out Erza... it'd be a close fight I'd say. Since Yato's are monsters an so is Erza.
omg lol i love kagura shes so bad ass shoot erza to death with her umbrella and super strength
Thepoorfool The doctor doesn't like violence..... oh well...
darnit, just get to the part where minerva and erza actually fight already
i hope erza destroys her
I wish they'd quit jumping between fights. One at a time, please (with Erza's first)
Too much filler, I want to see uninterrupted battles DBZ style
rebuild_eva01 You have said the best thing that could be typed in this section of the chat!
@rebuild_eva01 So you want them to remove all the filler episodes and sub-plots just to use 20 minute long power-up sequences about 6 times per fight? There are multiple kinds of filler. X3
You know what really sucks? Living in of those houses that is near Laxus and Kagura's Archenemy attack this episode....
Well, they said the city would be fixed with magic, so.....

...unless you don't attend, then what? Won't they make you temporarily live elsewhere? This tournament is a great cash cow now that I think about it...
Minerva is a true savage

lmfao if only ....but no
I wish that would happen.
I think they keep fucking up the princess' translation whenever the princesses says "she" it's suppose to be "that person"!


i love Fairy Tail!

Still, it is Fairy Tail and I look forward to each episode.
who dosent love fairytail :3
Sad peoples
I'm still so happy that I get to see new episodes after that long hiatus. Also I get to see and hear new episodes... with Happy.

wait till the Erza x Minerva / Laxuz x Jura / Gajeel x Rogue fights, that's then the real epicness starts
What about Cheria x Juvia that fist fight was intense! Not to mention the rivals Gray x Lyon after all they did train to fight to see who's stronger.
Did anyone else duck for cover when they saw the face on Erza? Be honest here.
I did. : (

Erza Vs Minerva Laxus vs Orga Vs Jura lol thats gunna be one hell of a fight :3
You forgot about Gajeel and Rogue

it's true; orga's face drop the second their fists clashed. He knows laxus would rape him. So seeing Jura show ...well GG
Dude this shit doesn't hold a candle to what happens after the battle ends.
minerva made the worst mistake ever, she made erza mad
Even worse, tried to kill Erza's friends
She didn't try to kill them because if she did she wold get arrested (and the guild disbanded?) anyway she just sorta half-killed them so she wouldn't get in trouble (although they still could die from injuries after the fact).
@hmmmmmmmane uh true, but I don't think Kagura has a lot of life left after that attack, on the other hand millianna has a better chance of living.

Yay they survive and we get to see Erza use her super saiyan powers.
the last person you would wanna anger is Erza
OH Juvia, we just love Juvia. And that Gajeel vs Rogue fight is going to be intense. Fairy Tail will always have a place in my heart. ^^
Rogue probably shouldn't have said that he wasn't as strong as Natsu ( even thought it's true ).
Am I the only one who is still very suspicious about this "future Lucy". Something just doesn't sit right with the whole situation.
@Plucker: C'mon, nothing about any Lucy ever is suspicious. She could say unicorns are shooting skittles from their horns and you'd have to believe her.
Where is it written, that the spoiler tag is for current episodes? I'd rather say they are for things happening in future episodes. If something shouldn't be done, then it is commenting (or reading comments from) an unwatched episode.
The comments are for this particular episode, therefore, the spoiler tags are also for this episode. Manga should be discussed in the forums. This is pretty much how crunchyroll works.
How is she even remotely suspicious we knew that she would be involved with the eclipse project. So she could easily travel in time and warn the princess.

Did she lift that big ass rock with one arm? What the hell was the point in saving her then...
Gravity powers yo
Erza's just awesome that way
So the future lucy took the effort of coming back to the past to try to change the future but is slow on telling her guild on what will happen and how they can help, while the lay-back princess waits before taking action that can save life?
