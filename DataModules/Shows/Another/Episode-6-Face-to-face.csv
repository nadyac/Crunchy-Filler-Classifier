When they started dancing around i was cracking up. Looked like something I would do if I had been them X3
i couldnt stop laughing at the dance scene xD well now i think it's safe to say he likes Mei
Probably... i mean she is sort of badass with her almost emotionlessness
If I was being treated as if I wasn't even there, I would find a boombox and play the loudest music I could find.
If I didn't exist I would set up a drum kit a play in the most obnoxious distracting way possible.
I would throw things at people and say "YOU WILL DIEEE!!!"
I would probably just draw on people's faces with markers cause I don't exist, do I? They cant do anything about it anyway hehehe
Id probably be awkward about it and sit on everyone's lap just randomly. Or their desk. Or face.
The thing about the naked stuff is that they're just pretending you don't exist. They know you're there....And they can see you naked/fapping or whatever the fuck you decide to do.
I can't help but think that Kouichi has a crush on Mei. Seriously, does a friend daydream about dancing with another friend in class. Plus he keeps hanging out w/ her even though he doesn't have to. Still think he's the dead one.
man !x!
I'm guessing its the countermeasures girl that's dead, either that or she has some motivation to keep it hidden if Kouichi is dead since she did say that that she checked and he wasn't, and since she could have checked everyone the same way
What if the dead person is the countermeasures person like aDrowningFish said but is also the ghost of Kouichis mom. That would explain why she thinks she knows him O.O
THEY NEED TO MAKE OUT ALREADY
Well if he is the dead one, wouldn't the doctors and nurses at the hospital have noticed that sort of thing?
Is the teacher gonna make a salad??? What happens NEXT? :O
lol..."I did everything I could to make you healthy this year...but you keep eating junk food. IT'S TIME FOR A SALAD BOYS AND GIRLS"
oh man... now there is a great cook there!!! wonder who gave him the idea!!!

irresponsible father.. or maybe he doesn't know, but I would NEVER get near the town again or let any family near it.
But how could he know? The calamity scrambles your memories, so it could be a honest trip and he could have forgotten about the calamity after his wife died and it could be assumed that she died in childbirth and not the calamity...

I thought It was two heads.
ya... school days Makotos head!!! he is the EXTRA student XD


^ That actually doesn't make very much sense
I think the reason the charm didn't work is because two dead people came to class this year.
His fathers lung collapsed before so what if half of him died, and his dead half is going to school now? and the year that it stopped midway, they must have found the dead person.
But he wasn't there at the beginning of the semester so wouldn't that mean that he can't be the ghost? How could his mother have died from him? She'd be too young to have a kid in that class and die from it. I just don't know yet.
why do they keep showing the water tower on the school roof? Dark Water anyone?
omg i had the same thought!

Yeah.... unless he's got some guns in there or a shit ton of other knives, I doubt that one knife would make that much noise. Even with a bunch of books in there as well.
dead body part or something looked like he was being controlled
He's probably going to kill himself out of grief of a dead loved one--that is, a loved one who probably died via the curse in some fashion. Either that, or he's gonna try going after Kouichi/Misaki. Wonder what happens when you kill a ghost
maybe in the bag he has A BIG machine gun!! LOL!! just in case if knife doesnt work!!
this kid dosent give a f***, i swear he wants everyone dead..
I wish that dancing scene was real....:(
STOP. Dance time!
if i were a non existing person i would do every thing i want i probley would take a shit on the desk and tell the teacher to eat it or throw it at him

Sssooo, his dirty fantasies are of him and Mei dancing together. Doesn't set the bar high does he?
I loved the daydream <3
I think being nonexistant to the classroom sounds fun now, you could pretty much do anything you want. It'd be fun to just whip out your electronic devices once you finish your schoolwork.
OMG they should kiss... Cutest and Non-Existent couple 2013!
Don't Exist Huh? No Need For Clothes Then Or Even Homework, Why Couldn't I be Shunned When I Was 9th Grade?
umm maybe cause the rest of the god damn school can see you lol
