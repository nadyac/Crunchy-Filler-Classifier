"It dodged me like I was nothing!" Maybe because you shouted right before hitting it? What did you expect? Lol
Imagine you're enjoying a walk and some little bug comes flying out of nowhere with a weapon screaming "AAaahh". Im pretty sure i would dodge it also. Then step on it for being annoying.
Lol I never knew Asano and Chad were dating.. xD
LOL I caught that too
My exact words where "wait... what?!"
wait... what? ahahahaha thats funny theyre not gay! haha ...right?
I'm boarding this ship all the way to Karakura town, YEHHHHH
lol thts the same thing i said he like "it's a great place for dates me n chad went the other day" like wtf ctfu chad say we had fun
poor ichigo, i remeber when i lost my ability to go super saiyan:/ its sad stuff
lol nice!
me too

that comment just made my day lols
I got to admit,to those who say this would have been a good ending,defenitly,but it's so bittersweet that i don't know...i felt like Ichigo died...
My eyes actually watered up at the end.... i was like "well damn..."
And I was like: There is still the manga to read after all this
How have people not noticed anything weird going on in the world? Suddenly walls fall off buildings, and so on? I mean they can't see Hollows or Shinigami, but they do see the damage they cause.
They blame it on earthquakes.
See the earlier episodes again.... their minds get altered so they think it's for instance an earthquake or something. So they in Karakura Town really should think about moving, since there are so many catastrophes there...
Global Warming
omfg rukia and ichigo moments!! so sad!!! ): i can't help but cry.
there there
T_T ICHIGOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!1111
the ambiguous ending piss me off, I mean like what was Rukia going to say to ichigo before she faded away.
"Bye, Rukia. Thank you." Crying. The ending was beautiful. :')
Ichigo hasn't been to school in like 2 years LOL dude is forever in the 10th grade
Oh man, they HAD to use the Senna music didn't they? QQ I love when it's just Rukia and Ichigo, the true essence of Bleach. Could've at least let them hug. Fuuuuuuuuu.
Rukia and Ichigo held hands...! Bleach bliss!
yup they totally should have kissed
ichiruki ^^
ichiruki <3 ^^
i'm not going to lie, i'm a little emotional right now. great episode, even if this is my 20+ viewing of it, still tugs at those good old heart strings
COME ON! Bleach needs more kissing! that was a perfect kiss Rukia moment... seriously.. it doesn't get better than that.. >.<
I always viewed them as more of a brother/sister relationship.
Yeah, Rukia and Ichigo should've kissed. I mean, forget about IchigoxInoue. Ishida has a thing for Inoue. She can be with him.
Are they really painting Chad as being gay? Even at the end he wants to cuddle Kon!
12:45 "It's not that big but it's a pretty nice date spot. I went there with Chad the other day!"
eewwww, just ewwww!
atleast Chad and asano are doin good. Poor Ichigo always stuck in the friend zone or watches the girl disappear in front him. This is as bad as Naruto when it comes too the main chara's personal lives.
@Irimi1983. I don't agree at all. Ichigo isn't trying to get with anyone like Naruto is, but we all know Inoue loves Ichigo, and Rukia kinda has a thing for him. At least she's close enough that she could fall for him when he's more mature.
I love that Ichiruki moment!! And what a sad ending..
The last part was not a filler but infact it was in the manga.
If they have to end the series, this is the way to do it - unless they do a distant epilogue, where he dies, goes to the 13 courts, and meets Rukia again.
I wouldn't doubt that the author originally wanted to end the series here, but the company wanted to keep the series going? Just a thought, it would have made a great ending.
No, in the interviews, Kubo said he wanted it to go another 10 years even before this point.. theres a good reason why this couldn't be a reasonable ending if you read the manga.. Ichigo is much more than the anime has let us see.
The ratings weren't good right? I feel the rushed feeling of the manga story now, I bet he changed it to what his vision originally was . But then again...10 years really? What else could he have done?
