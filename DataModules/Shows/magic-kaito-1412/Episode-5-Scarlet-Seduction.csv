I can't wait to see more of her!!!! =D
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaagic.
Aoko, if you hammer that tsundere button any harder it's going to break!
Well I know who I'm picking for my snowball team.
His face isn't covered by more than a monocle. Even if they can't tell his identity, surely they should be able to tell that his age is different from the Kid of 8 years ago...
-senses harem-
Harem senses tingling?
One for every color of the rainbow...
your profile picture made that really funny
I like how last episode he's like, "Psssh, Batman is a comic book character." and this episode he's like, "Oh, shit, witches are real."
So a white Valentine's Day is a big deal in Japan?
Worth the wait!
I don't know how I felt about the inclusion of magic in this series... Usually in these types of anime, things never really exceed the realm of reality, only stretch it. It was a bit disappointing to see that it was just some all powerful
force that simply couldn't be fought or argued against. I was expecting perhaps hypnotism, but not fullout MAGIC magic. It just feels like sort of a hack in a series like this. Just my opinion though.
Did you ignore the whole, 'Gem of Immortality' thing from the start? That's magic.
I kinda just assumed it was bullshit

Akako looks like she could be Parco Folgore's (from Zatch Bell) sister.
Shed a tear and you lose your witch power? LAME!!
Just watching Magic Kaito lifts your mood
Why is this kind of valentines thing not mandatory in the USA? DX
Don't ever interrupt someones monologue!
Kid's magic is the real magic here, he conquered someone today!!!
So smooth.

lmao! kid is pretty fair eh?
