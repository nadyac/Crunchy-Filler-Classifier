Total obidience! OBEY!
That song gave me a boner for some reason.
you are really really sick,,,
lol
wat type of fucked up shit are you into dark?
At 22:15... is it just me or does the controller look just like a dick? O.o Or maybe those jokes are just getting over my head...
now that you pointed it out ...lol
Why did you think Erec was always trying to get a hold of it? =X
absolutely, i noticed it early on too. full helmet lol
"size isn't everything.." he says while Erec is reaching for the dick shaped remote lol! also erecs balls are gone rofl lmao lol XD 8D
the princess looked really cute as a devil when she was sitting on top of everyone while singing. perfect leg cross sitting method
DAMN variation was pretty good
yes indeed .. Kaji kun has a very nice singing voice, He sang this ballad in the K Project , very nice. Suzumra too ( Gustave).
Awhh this sucks.. 2 things.... Wish that song was a real one... and wis he song the intro/outtro song..
I believe those were their character songs, and the ending credits had the names of them, so. They're real songs. Yeah.
The princess's alternate outfit toward the end was quite appropriate.
hmm im glad we got to see the evil princes again
I don't know about you guys but I want to hear more of Kon's song.
kon sings the anime intro o,0
and the outro
I'd have liked translations.
Hime's song was awesome.
I really liked Variation's song, well the small part of it that we heard anyway
Uhu i played it about 10 times wish it was 3 minutes long

My dynamite swings from side to side?.. such...imagery...too much!!! *0*
06:30 The start of the melodi, reminded me of the dragon ball theme song:D
It totally was!
Pointlessly rediculous and random anime, yet for some reason i cant tear my eyes away.
lol loved the ending
OMG Marian's song. Where to download? lmao
Poor Erec-sama never got to sing...
what happened ...This one seem to disappear from the list of anime , I have to do a search for it.
I want to hear Variation and Gustave sing more..
i laughed my ass off with this episode!!!
the princess is one spoiled evil bitch.
the awkward moment when your mom walks in at 20:15 and your not sure what to say...
