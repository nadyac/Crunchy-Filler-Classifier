Moral of this episode-- stay in school.
"I wouldn't die even if they killed me!" Shirou disapproves of this statement.
Someone with a shameful past trying to turn things around but being harassed into going back and having to have Kenshin and co. save them...this is becoming quite a pattern isn't it. =0
There is usually a formula for filler episodes. Not just in anime filler episodes, but in a lot of television shows. ^w^;
how do they always find him.
Seriously... Kenshin's groupies must follow him around waiting for the opportune moment to jump in and "help".
This is the worst episode in this fantastic series so far. Come on,there is no way a fight like that could end without at least a few deaths on either side. I guess this is a bit too light hearted for my taste.
I'm pretty sure one or two probably drowned in the river. Either way, there's nothing wrong with being lighthearted every once in a while. And besides, this is a romance, really.
so... his secret attack is missing, so he can attack the EXACT SAME WAY again. Bushido Blade style cheapness. Wow.
Shiden no tachi... AKA a really fast sword thrust... what an amazing hidden move -.-
Then Toma becomes the third strongest swordsman that was an assassin and lives to repent his sins by.... how exactly? Oh well, he's a filler character anyway so whatever. xD
