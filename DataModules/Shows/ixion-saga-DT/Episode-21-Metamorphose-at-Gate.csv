sex you want you ain't getting...sex you getting you don't want.
So she finally found out he is a virgin XDDD
That was funny. But I wonder why Marian started tearing up when she found out Kon was a virgin.
why to take it from him of course! lol
Maybe Marian felt bad about earlier when she was teasing him on her episode where they covered her "backstory"
When Kon asked to be made a man and sainglain showed up i thought ewas gay Team Mysterious Kon
Marian would give it to any guy not just Kon lol.
I totally laughed when the knights said "ah...finders keepers!" I'm glad this anime is going for at least 1 more season.


The eye color is wrong. That's the best clue.
At some stage I was also thinking that the princess could turn out to be Alma Flora, regardless, the difference between the eye colour. Since the possibilities are still endless as long as alma technology remains the core of the story.
yea their eyes kind of have the same shape/style
She could be one of the princesses seriously there's at least 36 of them. and that would explain why they look alike.
Sailor Moon reference, haha good job Ecarlate
lol loved the sailer moon refrence.
I think the symbol on marianne's hand was a G Gundam reference to the king of hearts or in this case queen of trans...genders

Surprised no one mentioned street fighter...
lol or barve 10 the demon king sold i keep going

My favorite moment lol Only Kon would say something like that.
Please make me a man. I will make you a man. I laughed so hard when i saw it was sainglain.
Yes warriors, all you need is money

lvl 86 super saiyan
over level 9000
its more like th 9 tails from Naruto
over 9000 tails
I suspect that SS is one hair, SS3 is two hairs, and beyond SS4 is 3 hairs. Each hair is at least 2 levels of saiyajin power.
Poor poor Kon, so dumb he actually thinks he's gonna have sex with that woman. lol
why wouldn't he have sex with her?
@17:29 Sailor Moon!
lol i had missed that
lol yeah that was funny, but to be expected from the Princess! Sailor Moon probably wishes she had her power levels lol
Am I the only one who loves this opening song so much?!
Well, I guess its good we got answers, but...aren't there only 3 episodes left?
no news on how many episodes there will be yet... could go on for a year or end in 3-4 weeks bt the way is going might be the year....
OMG....that ending just kills me every time! Hahahahahah!!


if that's what he wants, Kon should've played LovePlus instead XD
LMAO Ending credits star with somthing 'ERECTING' xD thnk god it was jus Erec's finger o_o

Actually it said at the end of that episode that Kon's DT remains intact meaning it didn't happen and Marian was only teasing him.
i love this anime lol
