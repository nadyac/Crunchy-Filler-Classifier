these don't really count as fillers sense the main story is over. in 50 years when bleach is still going, im going to tell my grandkids i watched it from the start, all 2928 episodes.
I REALLY hope that happens

They are not really fillers since they are talking about Ichigo losing his powers
Yes they are fillers since they were not part of Tite Kubo's manga.
The teamwork between the Captains and Yoruichi is so freaking awesome~! x3
What ever happened to the 3 lil mod souls that helped with the Bounts? Why are the not helping in anything else the just disappeared!?
They are hidding with Nel and the other people that are not allowed air time on bleach. XD
They are filler characters sorry guys they never made a real appearance in the manga. Their being added in any part within the main anime was just the decision of the anime designers deciding to add them in nothing more.


Those 3 are sitting with Inoue at 04:33
go MAD scientist kurotsuchi
Now you're thinking with Portals.
Lol, that was a win of Kurotsuchi's part.
that last twist in this episode made me laugh fairly hard
woot go mayuri!! (never thought i'd say that)
Myuri is fit for Head captain or higher but i can see why he isn't cuz he is very unstable i didn't even realize that was him that is seriously scary man everybody in the seireitei should fear him he is like the Pharoh or the reapers lol
On a Bleach binge tonight. Trying to catch up.
oh my god thats why mayuri is my favorite captain
Teamwork!!! That's unusual. Especially for people this powerful.
I should have payed more attention to the battle, but whenever Byakuya shows up, I can't help but look at him with his torn clothing.
so basically kagerosa can manipullate all space and can record and rewind attacks to make it simple he can copy and paste
loved how yoruichi and the captains teamed up together! such amazingness
Mannn. All of the "oh no" *grimace I'm dying* followed by "fooled you" *smirk* so annoying.
Epic battle.
hard rock makes the action scenes better. for me anyway.
Okay, that was an superb last 15 minutes, and an excellent reminder of how the Soul Society has survived for several centuries without our favorite red head. By being incredible.
hitsuguya is a fucken pro he has really gotten better after the aizen saga. figuyring out that guys moves. and he took a blow from kenpachi and still got up! he really is a boy genuis mad props o him
