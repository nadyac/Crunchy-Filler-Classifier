It's a shame that this show has to end on a weak arc like this... it's not like its totally awful, but its far from the best the series has to offer
Sano Interrogation works best!
What's surprising is that Sano didn't get lost, must have been a great horse.
This was back when fillers where actually enjoyable.

She can't die her and kenshin have to make babies so great great ..... grandson Gintoki Sakata can be born.
Except Gin Tama takes place like about the same time as Rurouni Kenshin.
