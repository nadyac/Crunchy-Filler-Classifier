Kenshin is pretty awesome, that he is.
The japanese yoda, kenshin is
same thing i was thinking! Yoda all the way he is!
Thats because all us nerds think alike! That I love.
A thought just occured to me, that guy must have some extreme planning to manage to float by and snatch up Kaoru. I mean seriously, must have practiced that for days.
Please, take my like, I didn't even think of that!!
The subtitles are horrible, that they are.
There are even a few places where there are words missing, that there are.
Oh my, Kenshin's making us do it too, that he has...

Such a spoiler comment
no spoiler there unless u didnt watch the first episodes they been callin him the Battousai since the start
Besides, this show is almost 20 years old now, the statute of limitations on spoilers is long past.
It was sarcasm... As in there was no need to make the spoiler warning.
Oro ?!?!
Kenshi is crazy in man mode
I can't help but wonder why Jinei didn't just kill Koaru, I mean seriously, that would make Kenshin hate him far more than simply kidnapping a girl.



The music made it hard to take the fight seriously lol.
If not one of my favorite episodes from the series.
Those blood red glowing eyes
It was kinda bs that Kaoru broke the spell but then again, the spell in the first place was even more bs so....
She broke it because her love for Kenshin was stronger than the spell.
And see what happens.. Lol
That was a close one :c
