anyone remember when banki was the sacred almighty power of the strongest shinigami and only envoked in the most dire circumstances?
agreed, but I think in this episode its intentional to highlight how ridiculous the situation is, everyone going all out over a kite festival. I enjoyed it. =]
so while ichigo is training his butt off every one else is doin this
no one could fly either
I remember the espada's wouldnt even draw there swords for no one
pepperidge farm remembers
HINAMORI & TOSHIRO PULLED A TEAM ROCKET! EXTREME KITE FLYING! i love the yoruichi & kenny kites too! this episode is so pointlessly awesome <3
why was hinamori scared of falling? they can all fly!
Love the reference from Munch's painting "screaming man" on Kira when Soi Fon show up with the Yoruichi kittykite! Anyone else noticed it?
Lolz. 17:29 Renji does the moon-walk.
Holy shit, that is fuckin hilarious! xD
Awww Byakuya!
awwwwws i wanted to see rukia dance! ):
I want to see you dance.
...

series celebrate the new year with a special episode and people are bitching about it? grow up
Head Captain Rule: When flying new years kite, NO BANKAI
Just because it's a filler ep, doesn't mean it's automatically bad.... I for one loved it ^__^
It's so strange seeing a Hinamori that is not psychologically broken... or run through with a sword.
"when your toes are tired put a chili pepper in your sock" i must try that.
that was hilarious.
whey u see a kite that said 69.....it dawned me.....hisagi has a sex position on his cheek.....~cough~
If you think about it, Ichigo + Rukia is kind of weird... I mean, he is 17, and she is 150+... That would make her pedobear.
I love filler episodes, esp. ones that take place in the seireitei
what the heck was Kaien saying
I really wanted to see that dance.
I want to see a Quincy Dance Recital!! LOL
