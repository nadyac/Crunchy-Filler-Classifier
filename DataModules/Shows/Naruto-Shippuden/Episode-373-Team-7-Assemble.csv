Sai, epic fail.
he had the courage to attack at the center and he did his best, that makes him a worthy shinobi. Also, he was able to assess the situation.
@KaraZorEI Really?!? She was badass when she fought Pain, against all odds.
It's too late for me to really care about Sakura trying... I mean I just power ran through the entire series of Naruto and up to here in Shipudden in like the last month or so and I always though everyone over exaggerated her... But nope XD
midblue79 said, "yea sai started out with potential but this episode just made him feel like an add on, like he didnt belong at all... " s1Lykos said, "filler episode..." In this case, Sai was the "filler" for Team 7. LOL
screw the camel in shades....give me a smoking ninja frog on my cig pack any day
looks like we have 3 new legendary sannin

@SirManguydude Sakura isnt as weak as she was 3 years ago but "Just that one regeneration technique puts Sakura on par with So6P power." A little too much? :/
It is not like Sakura does not know anything original. If you think about it, Sakura was not born in a traditional Ninja family. She does not have a Sharingan or a Kyuubi inside of her. She's not a Senju. Still, she made that far by herself
@AlMitchu Whaaaaaaaaaaaat? she wasn't born in a traditional Ninja family? So what the heck is the Haruno clan? chop liver?
the Haruno clan is part of the civilian side of Konoha, not the Shinobi side :3
That was the fastest 20 min episode ever. Hehe im not a sakura hater or lover.. but she looked good with that healing mark lol
Pretty fast yah since I skipped half the episode No offense to Sakura but we've heard the "I'm strong too" speel already
It's that big forehead
billboard brow!

she wasn't a total waste of a character for these few episodes
Narutos face when sakura goes all badass is about as good as Minatos when the 1st and 2nd were bantering at the Uchiha Hideout
Yeah that made me laugh out loud to man!
Yeah that face was epic...lolz
XDDDD So funny I so wasn't expecting that face at all and then there's sasuke as usual just stays quite and tries to look cool.
That part was hilarious! XD

Gamakichi has quite the growth spurt.
I dont' think you can actually kill the Summons as it's a contract so unless the contract is for them to fight till death they'll probably just be sent back automatically when injured enough.
Thank heavens they didn't censor that giant cigarette in his mouth to avoid a joe camel moment, since a lollipop in his mouth a la what 4 kids did to Sanji would look beyond stupid. Not a cig fan but making characters look silly doesnt help
Nope they can die did you forget Danzo killing a Messenger Frog
Didn't Sasuke kill Manda when he summoned him during Deidaras bomb?
flamerdance58 orochimaru's snake was killed by sasuke to protect him from deidara's self destruct bomb when sasuke summoned it to eat deidara so it exploded in it stomach and caused it to die
Sai: I'm a part of team 7 too. Consuela: No, No, No
Goddamn it, the Consuela reference made me spill my coffee, good one.
Best Consuela Reference EVER!!!
lmao consuela
wow good one


I think that last part was worse than all the other ones before it combined.
Def not Schwing approved.

hahahahahaha thats gold!
@MintSharpii Hilarious
Would of been funny if sai said "i'm gonna go for the main body, and become hokage"
Seriously, that's probably why he almost got killed. Since Sauce's declaration everyones thirst for hokage has them stepping out and stepping up, he took it too far on his own, way out of his lane. Next he'll probably try to solo Madara.
lol Team 7 just got a handicap! Everybody gets 1 Sai! That was your mulligan!

"Technically I'm part of Team 7 too!" Ten Tails: Nope!
This comment ... So much Win!
All I hear is "LUUUFFY-SENPAI!" whenever Shikamaru talks now...
Damn wonder if its Luffy from One Piece, don't know who this Bartolomeo is haha only on ep 311
@MikeFoSho, You've got a ways to go, haha but it's hilarious! If you want to know what they are talking about though, just youtube bartolomeo L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-UUUUUUFFFYYYY SENPAI and just watch that part of the clip. It's hilarious,

"We should all aspire to become Hokage." *Akamaru barks* Even the DOG wants to become Hokage!
They can dream, but we all know who is becoming Hokage!!! Sorry Akamaru! Maybe you can create a new village with Kakashi's team and become their Dogkage. But don't forget "It's the ones that are acknowledge that becomes Dogkages"!
@jmc0228 i sure everyone acknowlege Akamaru
Idk, the Village Hidden in the Dogs doesn't sound too good...
Takes "everyone and their dog" to a whole new level.
Squad 7 back in action!!
*Toad* I'm gonna light up a cig before I get summoned guys. Watch how badass I look
Hinata, if it took you that much energy to defeat one, we'll see you in heaven xD
lmfao made my day man thanks xD
Yeah, I'm glad they're all showing off new abilities made for taking out hordes of enemies. I'm sure that wouldn't have been handy against the endless army white Zetsu clones.
@ Lightestcube408: I was thinking the same thing LMAO. All that for one? smh
I knew it from the moment that they started showing off new moves that someone would take down a single opponent like its a great accomplishment. Shino should also watch out. Will every enemy stand there as a beetle crawls down his arm?
bobmonkeys: To be fair, Shino outclassed everyone in sheer brutality with that move. Was it practical? Nope. But it was damn cool to watch.
When a Sakura stereotype Sakuras you right in the Sakura
Quit Stephing it up...
^ no game no life bahaha

I think he likes what he sees.
^ Sasuke likes being dominated so the "new" Sakura is right up his alley.
Sasuke needs to take Sakura so Naruto can have Hinata :3
yes i hate fake ass sakura
I think Sasuke might be more into Naruto than Sakura.
fucking amazing cant wait for next week!!!!!
Damn, pretty thrilling episode, I mean the 10% that wasn't just a bunch of flashbacks.
10%? more like 40% it finishes officially at the 11:30 mark
Not often I skip ahead to pass flashbacks but I did this time....twice.
It's less than 30% if you don't count the OP. There is new stuff between 3:50 and 7:20.

Sakura is such a Steph.
Absolutely
Agreed.
Poor Sai and his failed attempt to shine. Kuchiyose!!!!
Well Sora could actually find a use for Steph, give him Sakura and Idk....
