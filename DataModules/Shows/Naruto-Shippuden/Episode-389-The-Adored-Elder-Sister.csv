I'm usually completely against filler.... but it's loli Hinata and Hanabi filler. I could die of moe.
Its filler, but its Hinata filler sooooo
Filler is anything that isn't an advancement of the anime's plot meant to use up or "fill" time. It isn't necessarily just anything not in the manga.
Filler is annoying because you know that absolutely nothing that happens will have any lasting consequences, so nothing is at stake.

They all knew Hinata held back.. That's why they turned their back on her.. Heck, it was pretty obvious from the way he talked that the entire point of the fight was to see if she'd hold back.
Her dad even said, "She's too kind."
my god, hanabi has a bigger forehead than sakura
Forehead? How about head in general? Her head-to-body ratio is insane lmao.
Was thinking the same, they kind of overdid it with the child-proportioning XD
I'm not so sure, she's actually that young.
Could be a suitable weapon of some form... Or a place for a curse mark... Just saying, you know...
So much for "filial love."
As the president of the NaruHina community, I support this filler. Hinata shall not disappoint!
This episode reminds me of how much I hated the villagers
Not going to lie, that cursed mark activation looks painful as hell.
Yeah it did!
i know right
poor neji
Totally did not stop working on a paper and started to watch this >_> But this episode was adorable... And so are you: PFMK93F6VSW
Chibi Hinata FTW! FYCSUQE7STZ

Yeah, i know right? why would i watch naruto when im supposed to be starting an essay that is due tomorrow and i havent even started? that would be so silly.
*sees a small glimpse of neji* *sobs*
It's a filler but, this was actually interesting It was cool seeing Naruto as a side character from someone else's eyes.
For a second I was very confused because I used to use that same picture for my Facebook profile.
so wait...Hinata LET her win? ...man that changes a lot
hinata did it on purpose so she could be closer to her boo ^_^
No. She is not that selfish. She did it because she couldn't hurt Hanabi in a battle where win and defeat counts.
Hinata didn't let her win; she choked. She hesitated in a crucial moment and loss as a result. If Hinata actually wanted Hinabi to win, she wouldn't have been so miserable.
Yes, let's be mean to the guy with the nine tails. That will make things better, as if it ever was better in the past treating Naruto's kind in such a manner.
How awkward must it be to be the Mask shop owner when he runs into Naruto, the hero of the Hidden Leaf Village. Not to mention in the Future (you know what I mean).
Poor Hinata....she's so strong, but she's too kind to cause serious harm to others. And they scold her for it...
Can you consider thi sfiller though? These two episodes are obviously meant to give context to the movie coming out Friday.
I cant wait for an Hinata episode, even if its about Hanabi!!
Hanabi is pretty great too!
hinata-filler is the best filler! n_n
totally agree
All according to keikaku...
!! ;p
I can certainly understand why Neji looks pissed most of the time.
jeez...talk about a powertrip though...
