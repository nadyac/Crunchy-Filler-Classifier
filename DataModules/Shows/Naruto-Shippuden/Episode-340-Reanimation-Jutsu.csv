Uchiha Madara is a cheat code.
@modo24. Just be patient. Madara will explain the Rinnegan and how he has been involve form the very beginning with Tobi.
In order to have the rinnegan I thought you needed to have both Senju and Uchiha powers, but I could be wrong
its been stated multiple times that the ninja world was on its way to demilitarization so it only makes sense ninja would be weaker than before when war was so common theyve simply gotten soft
The Rinnegan is an evolved form of Sharingan, yes. But, they need Senju blood/cells to activate it. Nagato had Madara's Rinnegan implanted into him, and since he was an Uzumaki he had the body/spirit to be able to use it.
There's a difference between being "one step ahead", and having Plot God Mode on. Madara qualifies as the latter; that rule he cited about reanimation jutsu came completely out of left field with no precedence.
After singing his silly song so many times, Naruto still manages to forget "Old Man Beard"s name in the end.
"Old Man Beard" seemed a little miffed that Naruto called everyone by name, except him.
Hold on a minute... weren't there cloud ninja in that gourd?

But.. if he's completely revived , then that removes that fact that he's immortal.. right?

Itachi is da best


i wish ppl had known it was itachi who was responsible for stopping edo tensei
i completely agree.. idk i feel that some comments should not be made even with a spoiler tag, simply because they give too much away
Spoiler tags should be used for the current episode only.
so true...
Itachi isn't a hero, he's an Anti-hero. He does things regular heroes don't do such as stick to the spotlight.
@Arthus Itachi is a real hero, not an anti-hero imo. Reason being...an anti-hero has a certain edge, or ruggedness to his methods...like riddick. Itachi just straight up stepped up to the plate and did the DAMN thing ! A true hero really !
Madara is admin surrounded by players and npcs
lmao

he was under confusion
My Toe! My Toe! (TMNT: Turtles in Time)
lols i know right :'D
I call HAX!!!!
lol, cheat code
At this point the show will never end. Madara and Orochimaru refuse to die.
Oh Madara will lose, but he will first have his way with Hashirama... Oro on the other hand... He'll most likely kill Kishimoto, then he will be the writer..
"Up Down Left Right AB AB" *Check Infinite HP, and Infinite Chakra*
UUDDLRLRBABA, actually.
Still not correct. It's: "Up up down down left right left right B A"
ZweiNor wins
forgot "start"
Everyone losses!
Is it just me or does that intor song get better for each epposide for no reason?
Not just you lmao..it totally does and im ok with that XD
T.T *sniff, They said itachi is a hero
Naruto knows who stopped it - he'll probably make sure to relay it to the right people so Itachi can go down properly in the history books.
Naruto, killer bee, kakashi, guy, and sasuke know Itachi did it. It will get out evenually
remember one thing.. itachi did tell naruto that the villagers are not supposed to know the truth.. so that may not happen, but then again, sasuke will probably tell the villagers
He only told Naruto not to tell the truth about the Uchiha massacre, he didn't mention anything about not telling anyone that he stopped the edo tensei.
lol i guess u could take it that way
I miss Itachi already
Naruto and Bee......DOUBLE UPPERCUT!
Not-Madara is doing WHAT?! Pretty sure I know, but isn't that kinda breaking the rules? And starting the End Game? Is this the beginning of the end?!
It's getting there.
they are still missing more episode

Happy Thanksgiving!
thanks you to
Wow that episode was quick!
It seems like as if everyone has forgotten about Jiraya.
In what sense? If you mean the reincarnation, his body is at the bottom of the ocean & out of reach. Although Kabuto stated the blood on the Six Paths of Pain's weapons may have enough DNA to raise him, he never followed up on that.
^^. What the post above me says. I will also add that came from episode 264 of shippuden.
I think xMike94 has Tsunade and Dan in mind...
An episode that goes directly to the OP? Dis gun be gud.
Time Lapse No Jutsu!

Yes, literally. They are literally in sexual congress with royalty. Literally.
