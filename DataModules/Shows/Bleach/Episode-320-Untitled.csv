ahahahha i love how there all in ichigos room. xDD
I love how Kenpachi posted himself right up on his bed lol.
haha they all in ichigo's room lol wow i bet byakuya wanted to stand right there bc he didnt want to sit next to nobody haha that is my husband for you
Hey, at least Byakuya was in there. Soi Fon was around the corner.
This episode was brought to you by Rangiku's boobs! xD

It was funny that they were all crammed into Ichigos room... but I still think this episode was really stupid... God I hate Kon...
I hate Orihime....so damn much.
Finally there arn't 6 min recaps, gosh....
why do I have the feeling that somewhere in this arc she's gonna say "i wanna go back and have barbecue with everyone"? LOL i laugh if she does, so cliche
Nozomi isn't very polite....
Yeah, definitely a better filler than most. My pet peeve is fillers that don't fit into the story or timeline AT ALL. But this one is being made to go directly after Aizen. Good job!
Yea, not only that, but it also was written closer to the style of the manga too. For example, while the Bount arc made sense in the context it was in (didn't interrupt anything) it was written in such a way that it didn't feel like Bleach.
i wonder what would've happened if the chili powder worked LOL
I want an all out war.... Right now.
I am saying that all this filler is to give time for Kubo sensei to get the new arc about Ichigo's power completed or at least enough pages to get Bleach back to the manga story. Its either there is no Bleach or have fillers for a while.
does she like the barbeque... to be continued! lol.
With the honor that byakuya has, i half expected the imposter (who as they say is near perfect to the original) to realize hes an imposter and kill himself. But nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
MY MEAT LOL

wow nozomi's a bitch.
don't worry, shes just in "tsun" mode
no ofence the green hair girl is cute but is a Beep maybe she will warm up. I know kon is annoying sometimes but people need to be nicer to him.
Why does everyone have to step on poor Kon??? xD
it's like going back in time. 1:30 intro and no recaps. thank you Bleach. now if you could let Ichigo be a bad ass again
kon is a N3WB
seriously if soul society is nirvana (heaven) then what does hell look like?
watch the hell chapter movie
