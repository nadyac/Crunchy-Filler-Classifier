Is it just because Im marathoning or are these episodes going really fast?
Wait does that mean that Kaito cheated on his last move or did he actually have skill??
He cheated, but that is his skill.
The truth hurts @Koske1
i can't stop looking at their noses
gotta be careful gonna put someones eye out
Seriously, can they just not turn sideways ever? Aoyama's style is not THAT ridiculous...
i still prefer akagis nose. that nose could slice someone in half
he changes aoko's outfit o_O
man i love this kids shenanigans
Aoko your drunk go home!
Ha, Aoko getting drunk without actually drinking any alcohol.
Well, the bartender that gave her the non-alcoholic martini escorted them to the secret room, so a different bartender gave her a refill, probably with alcohol. Unless he heard the whole "Martini no alcohol" bit I doubt it's placebo effect.
What I'm impressed with is how the bartender knew what to make with an order like that... Sure there's appletini's and such but they're different cocktails. A virgin martini is just ice and an olive.
Or how she didn't notice the switch given the rather stark difference in taste.

Well Martini's also are not served on the rocks so it would really just be an Olive.
the magic is drawing me in is this a trick?

What kind of bar serves chocolate ice cream so perfectly like that XD ? (and how the hell do you make a virgin martini? XD )
You put an olive in a Martini glass?
Kaito and Aoko make a cute couple!
I'm entranced by this anime...its so good
The pool hall is called "American in front of the train station"? Couldn't take 5 minutes to think of something just a little bit better?
Obvious names are obvious. Kaito, Jii, and now Hasura the hustler, heh.
Why is Akai (Ikeda Shuichi) Kaito's dads voice now!? What is going on!? Kinda sorta threw me off for a second there.
He has always been Toichi's voice actor
i didnt know the noses were lethal :'D
Not a hater or anything, but there noses become really long when they look to the side.

For a second, I thought those cards said "fuck" in the opening...
That was over the top, by using invisible strings to win pool. He should have got 2 balls in two different holes, not the ball being 'driven' to all 4 holes.
