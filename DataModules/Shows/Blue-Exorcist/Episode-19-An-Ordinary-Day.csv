xD Give a demon a cake celebrating the birth of Christ, that was hilarious!
@Skills47 She is probably just trolling. Don't let her get on your nerves.
a very funny joke there. also in regard to posting to top comments, I look at coat tailing on top comments just like posting right after the show goes live. if it's relevant or interesting, glad to see it; junk and irrelevant is wasted
The kitchen goblin must get bored with Rin doing all the cooking.
something about mephisto's "Fantastic!" was hilarious
In October, no less! (I think, if I have any capacity for memory)

^ but until then I shall enjoy this delicious cake represented in your honor. XD
the cake was so good it made him speak english
Son of Satan with immeasureable demonic power!!! ...flips out over stuffed pinky bunny...
I mean, who wouldn't!?!
Man, that was the best part! xD
are you kidding? it would be awesome to get a pink stuffed bunny
I loved it when Mephisto said " Oh, Fantastic ! " xD
omg!!!! rin is so mean he jumps out of the window "pssst you take care of the rest!" and leaves!!! what happened to never leave a man behind!? XD thats so funny i couldnt stop laughing!!!!! XD

i bet you only hhhhhh
The Christmas cake made me rofl! I like that they couldn't tell what was wrong with it. Hahahaha!
They sure didn't get out much as kids! haha
woaah. whatever rin's brother was doing at the beginning was suspicious...
I think he as testing his blood to see if h to inherited Satan's flame. . . I'm guessing
I think maybe he's got some kind of injury/infection or curse and he's hiding it from everyone, but that's my guess.
so he had holy water and there was some sort of reaction to his blood so it can be assumed that it is a demonic thing possessing him or something such as that

LOL MEPHISTO
that cake so good demons even like it lol
Never heard of Devil's food and Angel's food cake?
LMFAO, Mephisto's Reaction Was Hilarious .
Omg the part with Mephisto and the cake Killed me. xD Good episode overall :33
hmmm.... you're all focusing on the cake, but am I the only one who caught the restaurants name Magnaria? flip over the M and you get Wagnaria!!
I noticed that as well.
12:44 epic brother moment
Are we going to completely ignore the giant real picture of a cat on Izumo Kimiki's newspaper?
I didn't get it the first time I watched it because I had not watched much anime at the time, but Magnaria hahaha... I came back to this episode specifically to watch the cake scene with Mephisto.
When she said "Bir-" and then finished with "Birds of prey" how did that translate so well into English? 'Cause they showed a bird in the background.. Was it just a coincidence?
That I would like to know as well.
lol I always wonder about those things myself when they happen in anime
I screamed when he said his birthday was dec. 27!!! we have the same birthday except i'm the son of poseidon haha
