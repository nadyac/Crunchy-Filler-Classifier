That getsuga tenshou was so powerful that it made my computer lag.
I had to move cus my house exploded
Lol
When he fought Aizen the universe imploded and unmade itself, and then the after shock of the fight cause another big bang which brought us to where we are at now. So don't watch the fight again... otherwise we'll be in a unending loop.
i alredy did iv watched bleach 5 times what d i do ?
@HonestWing BEHOLD THE CREATOR HAS ARRIVED!!!
"That was just the force of swinging my sword." Brought tears of testosterone to my eyes.
Wait - wasn't all the friends in that house he cut in half?
iils all the sole reapers opens the oken and kills theroyal family and becomes god like izen planed to the freas izen and they become friends?
LOL
I don't why you down voted him, HonestWing's idea is awesome!
Genius Urahara Strikes Again! I WANNA SEE MO OF HIS DADDEH!
His friends were in the lower floor like Ginjo said. Ichigo destroyed the top half so they must be just scared at what happened.
dam these guys are assholes ive never seen ichigo cry
Usually he just yells at the ground and tells it to make him powerful
he was a cry baby when he was a little kid
Yaaa...have you seen when he found the Hollow that killed his mother? It was a brief period...but he did cry. Also when he got his ass whipped by Ulqiorra.
hes tears made my computer lag :v
lol johns commet is hilarious. but true. he does tend to yell at the ground and tell it to make em stronger
Well it looks like Tsukishima is now the proud owner of a huge sun room =D.
DAAAAAAAAAMN, now THAT'S what I call a Getsuga Tenshou!!!! "Heaven-slicing lunar-fang***
Fast forward to 3:00
God that episode made up for like 3 months of crap. What a pay off! just amazing.
Uh.. Ichigo. You missed.
First shot's always a warning.
ICHIGO YOU FUCKING IDIOT!!!!!! THERE'S STILL PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING HOUSE!!!!!
*Again* ...His friends were on the bottom floor, probably passed out.
so? he just raped the sky, ichigo can bring his friends back


"You've become so strong and mature since the last time I saw you... NOT!" *KICK* LMFAO. I MISSED RUKIA SO MUCH. :'D <3
Man i wasn't the only one who screamed like a girl when I saw Rukia with a Lieutenant badge right?
Ok this ep was a Mind Fuck lol, then it turned Awesome! ! !
The beginning was so slow, but than I saw Rukia and SWORE it was over, but it was only half way. Felt like two episodes.
Rukia is come back with vice captain badge??
Lesson learned: Humans, even if you have special powers, should not mess with Soul Reapers.
To see the look on Ginjo face at the end(GETSEGETENSHOU) epic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop ruining the story for people. Not everyone reads the manga. How'd you feel if someone told you everything that happens next on the manga? It gets rid of the surprise. There's a spoiler button for a reason.
Rukia.. the perfect woman In this episode, pretty much.
I noticed something. All the captains and lieutenants show up all grown up and tall...then there's Toshiro.
