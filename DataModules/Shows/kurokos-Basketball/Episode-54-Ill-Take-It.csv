And the MVP awards for the last season goes to...Kagami & Kuroko's shoes, for their outstanding service from highly demanding usage.
Akashi's eyes are scary...but cool. :3
Moneeb23 i never read the manga. That is what his eyes look like to me.
ararararagi senpai
Interesting... I just googled heterochromia.

^ i was wonder why they were the same color in middle school but not now. thanks!
She knows what shoes size he wares lol, bet she all so knows all sizes for Kuroko
wears*
LOL well they are OP.
Did you see how scared he was getting when he realized she knew his shoe size and the brand he wears. Amazing! Bet he was thinking she was like a stalker. I guess she needs to know EVERYTHING about everyone who hangs out with Kuroko.
She claimed she loves Kuroko and his girl.. but.. she always over Aomine... XD I wonder~~~~ :XP I bet she knows the size of THAT as WELL..... :XD
@HEEDLESS: I'm fairly certain that Momoi sees Aomine almost as a little kid that she has to take care of or he'll go and do something stupid. I don't think their relationship is at all romantic. I'm pretty sure she only has eyes for Kuroko.
I like it how Akashi calls Midorima by his first name. It feels weird listening to it, but it makes me want to call him "Shintaro" from now on
I like how he does that with all the generation of miracles, too ^_^ it makes them seem closer somehow
Is that the extent of that delinquent guys' appearance?. Akashi is cool and all, but I was hoping for more
I mean that's their first name. Like, do I just call Kim Jong Un... Un? Or Bill Gates... Gates?
actually kim jong un would be jong un. lol.
Why is crunchy roll like 2 episodes behind?
They don't have the rights for new releases until two weeks have passed.
The dribbling intensifies.
The suspicion is because some of Kuroko's backers are invested in another streaming site, so they simulcast it there to promote it. The copyright holder dictates the license and the delay was apparently one of the terms to CR.
Who cares... it's back.
Sucks they are behind but crunchy roll keeps me busy enough with other animes that I don't mind. I am just happy they are back.
Finally Rakuzan plays.
I have been waiting so long to see Akashi play!!
TAKAO! TAKAO! TAKAO!
Isnt Aomine starting to be from a jerk to tsundere? Like how he gave an excuse to give his own shoes to Kagami despite Kagami losing to him xD
He wanted to go 1v1 he gave no shits about the shoes.
Totally. I think Aomine has had the most character growth out of anybody in this show, which is one of the reasons he's my favorite GOM member (Akashi isn't far behind though!)
Agreed!

Everytime I see Baby Kuroko I pretty much forget everything i've seen for the past 24 minutes
Aomine gave Kagami a pair of his own shoes, such a nice guy.
Anyone else get bothered by 'more higher' ._>
Kagami and Aomine are my Brotp.
At first Aomine was an a-hole. But, he really is a nice guy when it comes to taking care of your friends.
Oh Akashi, how cool you are. They do so awesomely with the anime adaption. Just makes everything that much better and even more intense, including Akashi's scary...authority-ness.
