DAMN! The animation was amazing on this episode! <3
Soultaker78, I was about to referenced that episode. When Naruto drops a rasengan on one of the Pains it looks quite awesome in the manga, yet cheap production reduced it to one frame.
it sounds stupid but why dont they destroy the moon somehow and then they will have no moon to proceed with the infinite tsukuyomi
Because that is the one thing that 8 & 9 tails could do to put a stop to this but the show needs to go on.
and im sure the moon is pretty important and unreachable
Destroying the moon would kill uncountable innocent people and ruin the ecosystem. Even if it were possible it'd be a dumb idea.
I WANT MORE I WANT MORE I WANT MORE!!!!!!
@HeiseiSnipers -.- Watch the manga?
I meant Read xD thank you @TheForeverOtaku
ahhhhhh i want more can't wait for the rest to come out
@TheForeverOtaku Presumably he'll read it while he watches.
OMGIEEE!! TEN TAILS IS SO FREAKING UGLY :F
So basically after this battle, everyone has to learn new maps. "Wasn't there a mountain range and a river here?" "There WAS."
I was thinking the same thing
Cartographers are gonna make a killing selling their services re-mapping the area, and then they'll rake in the cash when they sell the new maps. They're just waiting, out of range, for the fight to end so that they can get to work.
Good thing Nami from One Piece isn't in this universe, or she'd be killing the Ten Tails with her bare hands by now xD
@DeadlyOats No I'm suddenly imagining an eventual filler episode where they fight of evil cartographer-ninja trying to cash in on the violence
I was REALLY looking forward to see this part when I read it in the manga. I was not disappointed. This episode was just AMAZING!!!
Same!

more like it'll cast Genocide No-Justsu

Tecmo Koei need to make Ninja Genocide No-Justu game
@SpiritWolf15 No filler either.
Itachi mastered genocide no jutsu
I imagine some shinobi standing in the far back of the allied forces: "Psst... Can you hear what the heck they're saying up there?" "Dude I don't know, just nod your head and smile when Naruto says something."
Everyone must have superb hearing lol
CELL PHONE NO JUTSU
Lip reading with Eagle Eye no jutsu?
Hmm, so we were all thinking that. They hear when you want them to, but don't when you don't want them to.

Maybe they were infusing their voices with chakra, so they could be heard across the battlefield.
I think THAT is going to happen in next weeks episode Omg but this was a great episode showed off how dangerous the ten tails is
Many tears are going to be shed.
Probably the very next episode.
no episode next week
I am going to cry a lot. This part was particularly hard for me in the manga. I'm not sure I'm looking forward to this episode. I may be depressed for a bit after it.
if only people wouldn't spoil from the manga. knowing 2 years ahead of time what is going to happen kinda takes the shock and denial parts away.
Amazing episode! The Allied Shinobi Forces strategy was soo sick but LOOL Madara and Obito were like bosses "they aint got shit on us, so let's just stand here and talk about their strategy". PS: I miss Tobi

Does not make that comment any less disturbing.
Actually yes it does

that feel when a new episode of naruto works better than viagra god bless
i don't even know how to respond to this
Like that.
Damn Nature You Scary!
WIN
shit just got real
shit geds real in this ninja war soooo many time XD
So much shit getting real. Gotta start watching where you walk... Have a guest pass while you clean your shoes. R9UQ836X3XU
Now THATS and episode
That Vel'koz Ulti so OP XD
his kda went 1M/0/0
hahaha It's true, the ten tails even looks like Velkoz XD
I laughed harder than I should have when Madara told Naruto increasing the number of losers won't make a difference. Naruto's simple retort "I'm not a loser!" made it all the funnier.
Great show with the dreaded cliffhanger.
To bad there won't be episode next week.
The next episode is in two weeks, check the wiki.
So long to wait.. at least they could give us 2 episodes then : (

The Secret of Nisesatoshi & Megashinka" Pokemon Special XY is than on air for hour normally it 30min Pokemon and than Naruto
They really went all out with the animation.


It's not going to happen in the next episode though, It'll probably be at least three more episodes before that happens. You know how they like to drag everything out.
they could of killed somebody else.it should of been the shinobi equivalent of the red shirt ensign with no name going on an away mission and is the first to die.do we really need kankuro or the cloud guy who is alway sucking on a lolipop
oh yeah.... for the next episode, im torn between wanting it to come, and wanting it to never be shown, as if it'll somehow reduce the reality of it. its gonna be an epic episode nonetheless!
We DO need lollipop guy
How can they hear each other they're like 400m apart lolz
I think that was a joke :I but if not they use telepathy
I think its only for the show..
I alwasy wonder about that too
