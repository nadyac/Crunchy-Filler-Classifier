Wow, did you see her spin the guy like a rope. That's insane, Best kill by far.
Damn Krista you got game
evryone loves krista
whyyyyyyyyy must the episodes end like this!?
Krista - the goddess that brings bread and horses and beloved by both genders as well
i love Krista <3 :3



No, I'm guessing based on the actual episode endings -- sorry for the confusion. The short character count doesn't allow for much explanation. But if you watch during the credits, there are clearly two cities painted on the walls.

@maybe America, some of the dialogue involving Mikasa like 5 episodes back suggests their on a different continent all together

thanks i thought it was going to be about the episode but thank for the spoiler
@ScornfulAngel Germany isn't in Asia.
@sean-connery i also think its germany because the amount of german names in this show and the fact that the opening line in the first intro song was in german
Can this episode not end? I don't want to wait another week for the next one. Dx
I don't know but waiting a week for the next episode is torture.
I read the manga once Eren got swallowed, freaking out over what was going to happen next. I can say this: Even after reading the manga, the anime still isn't spoiled for me. I'm still getting the shivers watching this.
Well Cliffhanger level - Over 9000!
reading the manga will just pose even more questions. result: you'll be more frustrated.
hAHA suck it Im watching it TWO YEARS in the future so I dunt have to wait FELL ALL OF THAT TIME TRAVELING PAIN AND EMOTION BUILD UP! YOUR PAST SELF COWERS AT THIS COMMENT.
GHHAHAHAHHA. That female titan is ridiculous! I can feel it, the epic Dual between titan Erin and The Female Titan, you know its coming!
The manga is from 2009...

what if the girl titan turns human or another one comes and turns human an her erin have kids and the kids change into colossal armored titans and they save the world that would be a bad ass lookin titan though
I'm gonna murder someone for ending it right there. I mean really what the hell -.-
@aznzishu Bzzt. Wrong.
Damn some of you need to learn how entertainment works. You leave at a climax so people want to come back and finish it.

I guess we have to wait...
Ah, let out behind yo- dang, to be continued. *rage flips computer*
Those cliffhangers....I'm in danger of falling
Let me catch you.
^ No sure if that's meant to be romantic or creepy.
I almost punched my monitor when "To be continued" popped up...... >_<
really because you most not been watching all the episode had been relevant in a few way.

what the hell kinda nonsense are you spoutin', derpyhooves47?
kamikuroso
I don't get it..
Wow. Longest week ever.
I blinked and missed the episode


I know right? I blink and nothing's happened. Five min recapping the last episode, five deciding what to do next, another five running through the forest, and bam! end.
lmao i laughed so hard with your comment. true tho
Rhapsidian always gets thumbs down, I saw your comments on Free! and I was like "Damn!".
this episode was fucking insane, I mean I know whats coming next but this blew me away more then it did in the manga. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen and the 3D is amazing. This show is worth all the hype.
I haven't read the manga, but even with the spoilers from dumb people on the site and random people I talk about the show with I'm still totally obsessed. I got people who don't normally care for Japanimation to drool over this one! So good
It really is, the animation when Eren was swinging through Trost before the boulder part was amazing, along with the 3D Maneuver Gear close-ups and a lot of stuff in this ep. Beautiful animation.
@Theraphosidae: Please, Please, PLEASE don't use the word Japanimation to describe anime ever again. That is an old, outdated and slightly racist term for it.
That felt like 5 min
This anime takes so much time on explaining on its recap..... its about 3-4 mins for the recap and oppening
they're probably doing all the recapping because otherwise they're gonna catch up to the manga too quickly, and it's been on pause for a bit. the recaps let them stretch the episodes out longer so the writers have time to continue onwards
The creators should of made these 1 hour episodes. 30 minutes is way too short!
HERE, HERE! I only get so much time to hide from my kids. An hour a week would be wwaaayyy better than 30 min.!

CLIFF FUCKIN HANGER!!!!!!!!!!
^ Pretty much.
I read the manga, and this was still one hell of a cliffhanger.
Well currently the manga is on its biggest cliff hangers ever so i don't know if its a good idea to read it lol
We got cliffhangered.
*Falls off the cliff and gets hung on a branch!* AAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!
This episodes cliffhanger.. YOU CANT BE SERIOUS LOL?!1!
NOOOOO I DONT WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK -collapses-
I don't either! D: next week will be the end of my free trial </3
Just be sure to be signed in when they release it. First few comments are usually people giving out their free trials
THIS IS BS...
While else screamed "WHAT?!?!?!" at the end? OMG!!!!
[This comment has been removed]
i yelled that - over 30 times lol
Is anyone going to talk about how the female Titan kicked that one guy and his horse 15 feet into the air?
That scene was amazing. So brutal...
She fucked him up!
That Titan is a total badass. I originally thought she was going to throw the dude she was swinging around at him. Oh wow, he got lucky, oh wait, NOPE!
Her yes disgust me they're so ugly and freaky looking.
gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!~ right as it was about to get good
Has anyone else been waiting for the moment it was released? I was ^^ :):):)
I've been waiting here for the last 3 hrs... lol
Same here!
OMG! What a cliffhanger!
I was waiting for so long that I started up an Attack on Titan themed run of Xcom:Enemy Unknown.
I've been waiting for a week
Why can't all the episodes be 60 minutes??? 25 is too short!
Damn! shes too much lol
i think baby is gonna kick mamas butt xD
I believe that this show is currently in a second season since they changed the opening and ending songs. Also I wouldn't be to sure that the show will continue. Sword Art Online was just as popular when it came out and it looks like...
... the show may not cover the Gun Gale Online and UnderWorld arcs.
Yes this is the 2nd broadcast season, or "cour" in anime industry terms. What the others are talking about i a "sequel", which often gets confused as a season among Western fans.
