Just push it out of the way, go for the gold.
I dunno, episode 5 pretty much qualifies him/her as a trap
IITS A TRAAAAAAAAP!!!!
Has to be the mirror trick.
Princess, stop, youre only making him horney.
so, does anyone know if Erec ever gets his balls back?
You smell like me. I've never laughed harder.



Mariondel and leon seem to be a Perfect Match for each other.... their both into Bondage lol...
what happened to all the lotion...
Leon Complete Masochist XD and i love how they do Stupid Definitely stupid Stupid and a masochist -.-
definitely hearing more Sogo in Gustave lately...(yes same seiyu im aware)
also, Sainglan and Leon is like reliving Gin and Hijikata...this ep was hilarious
This show is such dumb fun.
That's exactly what I was saying! lol Plus the similarities are pretty crazy. Sainglain is hard-pressed no-nonsense warrior (like Hijikata), and Leon is silly, always refusing, just like Gin. Too awesome.
