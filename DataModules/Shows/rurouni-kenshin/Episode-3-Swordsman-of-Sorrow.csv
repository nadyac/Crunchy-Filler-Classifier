Whoa, 94 episodes. This'll be a good Christmas.
I'm kind of over how the term Boss or Badass is thrown about lightly nowadays. First, there was Kenshiro. Then there was Kenshin. Nuff said.
apologies to Goemon Ishikawa, Duke Togo, Gattsu and Eikichi Onizuka- have I missed any other classic pre- 2000's BAs?
hahahaaahahahahaahahaahahaahahahahahahaah! I don't know..,
yusuke yurameshi....? u missed the alpha male of bosses...
well, he doesn't really fit with theme of the character you named but don't forget Goku.
Ah police oppressing the people...
still happening
That is exactly how the police be like in my all black neighborhood.
All this police officers better recognize! Kenshin has much higher rank than all of them.
I want Toonami back
Toonami is still there matter of fact cartoon network all december is showing a anime movie every saturday although its not same as toonami use to be its still called toonami
toonami exsists. its on adult swim every saturday/sunday at 11:30 pm with One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and more :3
If you forget that. Then you are just a usurper.
What a beast.
Sorry but I hate the culture of begging when you feel helpless always fronting about being strong then having the characters beg at the last moment gets annoying through out this series...
It's human nature I guess. You think you're so strong. When you face an opponent who is so much stronger than you, and you're so far from their skill. What's the next step? Beg for mercy.
awesome!!!!!!!!
This is my first time watching,and I feel like there is going to be AT LEAST one time in this anime where someone is going to hurt Miss Kaoru really bad, and Kenshin is going to go full badass Battousai mode and start slaughtering everyone.
