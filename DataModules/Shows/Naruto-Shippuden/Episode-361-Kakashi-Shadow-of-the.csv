Shu Shuriken.... WHATEVER JUTSU...! Jiraya Pls why you so talented!
I feel really out of place, I started Naruto when I was 12... I'm still twelve
I am 11...maybe started watching early june my b-day is june 24...it's august...uh yea...
really hope they show kakashi's full face instead of doing what bungie did for halo 4 where they give you 1 second to see Master Chief's face and most of the major detail was in the shadow...
@crunchyrolladmin1 The camera only showed the Master Chief's eyes, their was no hiding details in shadow, and it was just under 2 seconds. Beat game on hardest setting so I know.
@Skullie03 Mate my b-day's on the 24th of June too and I started all this 'bout march this year off an on.
The nostalgia.Damn its already been 12 years. I feel so old.
When I hit the retirement home I plan on holding up in my room streaming anime 24/7. Since I am 34, I have plenty of time to perfect this Jutsu!
i was getting tingles for half the episode and my eyes were prickling for the rest
Anime Otaku For Life
I'll be turning 20 soon and I started watching when it first came out in english on toonami
I'm 25. Whenever I do get old, I feel like the retirement homes and nursing homes will have to be filled with computers and gaming consoles. I've grown up on anime and video gaming and I don't want to be bored just because I'm old!
These are the flashbacks that don't piss me off. I always wanted to see Kakashi's point of view ^.^ Finally next week we get back to the main storyline! Some great stuff is about to come I guarantee you
@DaveJo, if someone doesn't know by this point, it's their own fault. It's been shown many times, and besides, every episode is on here so there's no excuse not to watch it.
I thought that explained that within the manga, I remember reading somewhere that the hidden mist put the three tails within her and were chasing after her therefore being the reason he killed her
Shelia219 spoiler
half a spoiler, someone already mentioned this in a epsiode comment section
kakashi helped sasuke trained in the chunin exam and naruto was a lil jealous but that's bec kakashi feel more responsible for teaching an uchiha than naruto. And sakura doesn't any sensei to teach her in the chunin exam. she's not useless.
I was dreading this episode recap. In the end it turned out better then I thought it would.
Right, this is either the second or third time they've retold this portion of the story and it's probably the best retelling yet. Nice to see another appearance o Sakura's parents.

I really missed Obito being crushed by that rock... hmmm... no I really missed that rock!! lol
Ok I might have cried a bit at this one
Mee too - but that's what I love about this anime
dem feels
2stronk
Hands of precious fallen comrades pushing him forward with love = tears x feels + nostalgia.
I teared up a bit too XD
So without Kakashi, there really wouldnt be a show here. Since he taught them to never abandon your comrade, that's why Naruto is so desperately trying to get sasuke back!
The Third thought Naruto would just be another Jiraya. He thought Sharingan was necessary to help Naruto control Kurama, but it turns out Sasuke is the one who needs help.
I have to say that I never realized how much of an impact the Third Hokage actually had here... Think about it, he chose the team by hand knowing full well what he was doing... He set the whole series in motion
What's weird is that I swear they originally said they were chosen at random.
Why would you tell someone we choose you specifically for this purpose? It would slow down or even ruin any progress to happen in the future.
If we're talking about who started everything, I think we are forgetting Danzo and how he created like every enemy Naruto faced in order to become what he is now.
The nostalgia in this episode will be strong <3
It really is amazing how everyone in Squad Seven has changed since that day. Back to the Fourth Great Ninja War next week!
especially seeing naruto the way he was at the episode's end compared to where he's at in the outro, so cool
Ah yes. Good 'ol Squad 7 days. Kakashi's life really changed when he met those brats. hehe But for the better. He's such an amazing Sensei~
that ending says it all!!! the feels!
Watching this when first comes on Crunchyroll is totally worth staying up till 4am. Love This Show
Kind of glad that its 9pm for me.
I wait all week just for a 20 minute episode...it's torture

Wow! Interesting how this episode kind of lined up with this week's manga chapter, and the end part with Kakashi talking to Obito and Rin made me tear-up T_T ... And next week back to the canon storyline!!!
Exactly what I was thinking. Identical flashback/content as what we saw in the manga this week. I doubt they could have timed that better if they tried.
I agree as well.
It was timed. At least that's what it said in the newsbite about how kakashi Anbu arc was to coincide with Naruto Shippuden.
filler or not still I enjoyed every bit of it!!
As far as filler arcs go, this has to have definitely been the best.
This is the only filler arc that I believe should've been included in the Manga. Fleshes out Kakashi sooo much more.
I thought the first 3 Shippuden arcs were decent. Twelve Guardian Ninja Arc was so-so, Three-Tails arc was pretty good, and the Utakata arc was my favorite.
Even the Third Hokage thing Sakura is average
thinks*
lol Yeah, she literally was just there as the love interest to spur on the rivalry, who MIGHT develop into a decent/good kunoichi... Classic.
The Third saw Sakura as another possible Tsunade.
or possibly the third saw the "love triangle" how Sakura was infatuated with Sasuke, and that Naruto was infatuated with Sakura, basically someone to glue Sasuke and Naruto together at the start
honestly he kind of said tht team 7 reminded him of his team u know tht one girl who starts off basic but grows super tough, then blah blah blah u get it xD right...RIGHT?! @.@"
Imabout to cry , ;')))))))))
I love your picture!
OMG Jiraiya is KILLING ME in this episode.. Enjoy the free passes since Jiraiya-sama got my ass rollin BGHTS6VVKCE YDDHWKPT74C
Thank you! took YDDHWKPT74C
can you guys pls show me how to use the free pass code
Cannon next week baababy!
I would consider the Kakashi episodes cannon.
don't
Anyone else had to rewind the video to see that awesome opening again?

now i want a jiraya/orochimaru/tsunade filler arc at some point.
I'd be really interested in seeing that dynamic as well as how they became known as the three legendary sannin.
It was in a fight against hanzo the salamander. He gave them the name because they fought him and survived.
Back to normal next week yassss
And it will stay normal for the rest of the year, I believe!
Honestly not that impressive, we're like halfway through the year, the Kakashi arc long overstayed it's welcome. Plus all we go back into are more canon flashbacks. Yaaaay.
...d-does this mean the story will continue next week?!?
It might. Unless it jumps into a recap episode or two to remind people that yes, apparently there's this war going on, stuff happened, and more stuff was in the middle of happening when the Kakashi arc started. Not that I didn't enjoy it.
