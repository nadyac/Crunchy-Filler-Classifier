I swear thanks to another certain samurai anime, when I hear the name Katsura, all I think of is "Zura ja nai, Katsura da!"
Casserole?

If you've been following the manga, you must be wondering where Saitou Hajime's afro is, why he talks so much, and why he doesn't end each sentence with 'Z'.
Sigh.. just love that ep! It brings back some seriously good old memories!
I know!!! Just awesome....
I remember practicing the Gatotsu and Hiten Mitsurugi styles on my buddies trampoline when were kids because of this episode! LET THE REMINISCING BEGIN!!!
God I remember how excited I was when I first brought home the VHS with this set of episodes on it. So good!
Wow, what an episode! Dat fight.
Every Big Man has that annoying twit who repeats everything they say.
This is getting good...
So far this is my favorite episode of the series. The first half was so amazing I will never get enough of it.
Well...that's one way to power down from Hitokiri Battousai level.
Kaoru is so annoying. She keeps ruining the atmosphere.
Kaori so annoying...
Now this is where it gets good... ep 30 landmark.
Wow! The hype about Saito was NOT unwarranted.
This is the episode I remember most fondly. I could even recall the unarmed segments almost completely after several years of not viewing them. The eyes and blades glinting in the dark make this episode.
Is it weird that I almost, yea, DO like the expressions Kenshin made while he was in pain from being impaled? Almost arousing.
