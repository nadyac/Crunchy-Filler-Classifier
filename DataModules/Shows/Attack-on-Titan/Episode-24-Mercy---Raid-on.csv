Damn someone get Eren one of those rings, he's nomming on his hand so hard I'm starting to wonder what it tastes like :/
everything tastes like "chicken" to meat eater eating other than beef or pork
Vsauce on youtube confirmed human taste. Taste like veal. If you dont believe me why dont you try some? Or just watch the video
love_lost20... having sucked on my boo boos enough I can tell you that blood tastes nothing like chicken... if I had the equate it with anything I would say its a mix between bonemarrow, 9v battery, and a really nice red wine.
im so glad i stop to read the comments sometimes, you guys are great
Between Naruto summoning giant anthropomorphic frogs and Eren turning into a badass german beast with long hair, I think I've seen enough of people biting their fingers and making the crunchyroll sound.
daaaamn, Mikasa has the scariest faces in this episode.
if looks could kill......

I thought it was cute
Eren's when he transformed was Face Was Scarier That was some Creepy pasta Shit
I still have a raging fancrush on her still. Don't even care.

if 1 more person spells eren erin I will slice there head off
erin
http://www.crunchyroll.com/erin
*to everyone who spells Erin like that* they're all just constipated and having a rough day -Captian Levi
Lol what if he said "hell yeah i want to have titan babys
I like how Mikasa put into action much of what she learned from Levi in episode 21. Still can't spin as fast as he can though.
ShhShhh... Sonic found the portal to this series and found a way to transform into a human..
he is garen.
When Levi spins, he reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog. "Gotta go fast"
^^^Oh my god now all we need to do is figure out who Tails is
I tried showing this to anime club, but they thought it was to gross! How dare they this is AMAZING!
Well, the amount of gore is pretty high with this anime. That combined with the hopelessness on some of the episodes turned quite a few off, I almost turned away... its the unique story that held me as I continue onto episode 25.
I watched this in my anime club at school too. People who weren't even in the club started pouring into the room to watch. Just shows how badass this anime is.
I'm in an anime club that is 7th and 8th graders, and the teacher who monitors that club said it was too graphic to show there, so we're watching SAO instead
We watch ecchi in my anime club.
just don't know good anime when they see it

Levi is not fighting because he hurt his foot because of Mikasa.
Damn why did Levi ended with a sprain or break curses the most badass warrior out of commission due to injury. JDS77 I agree that was a very disturbing look.
It seems like this show loves to just flash the uncanny valley with every character, titan or not, like a gun likes to shoot...and they do it so good!

it ought it was a great look
Eren's hand must taste delicious the way he noms on it all the time...
He just needs to sprinkle a little paprika on his hand and he'll be good. Nom away Eren, nom away.
@Lvl100Magikarp HAHAHAHAHA just nom away
The entire time eren tries to become a titan i'm thinking about the tea spoon and how easy it would be if someone had one.
Honestly, I was cringing the whole time Eren was forcing himself to transform. They got the nom factor done all right!


Levi - Deadly with both swords and words. :-)
Sassy doesn't even begin to describe Levi
wait for one week just to wait another one. This world is cruel!
I heard from other commenters that this Anime will start up again next year. I have not looked for an article that says so myself yet.
Probably will to allow more manga to be written.
I spoiled myself a little by looking at the jp manga covers, it looked like this was vol 8 of the 11 available. So either they'll wait until 16 is out, or they'll start early and pad it a bunch. Honestly I hope they wait...
Yeah, episode 25 is going to be the last one for this season. It's better to just take a temporary break until more material is available instead of relying on filler episodes. You know there will be another season with AoT's popularity.
exactly, its gotten so popular they have to make a season 2 now.
My heart's pounding. That was not 20 minutes. There's no way
But it's a good cliffhanger, leaves you wanting more!
the OVA is also canon and is linked to the manga.
Interesting I will gladly wait for the OVA
I think this episode made my heart stop.
Wait for it, wait for it... SUPER HIGH SPEED PUNCH OF GET OVER HERE DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!! *Destroys a building*
When Mikasa was talking to Eren about Annie...she looked as crazy as Hanji Zoe!!

That OST when Eren transformed... Every time I hear it I wet myself. Also Mikasa basically asking Eren if he had feelings for Annie as for why he couldn't transform. That's such a woman thing to do. XD
^I must know also x_x
I asked this before but got no answers. I figured it out myself though. You can stream it on youtube here. /watch?v=J0_aYOXzhqc at 10:56. the song is called "attack ON titan"
i know right. i transform all the time when my girlfriend does this to me too.
@valdrinemini Do not ask questions to manga readers here please. We get enough spoilers on everything already. ask them to send it privately or go to the forums.
Oh god! What an episode! And forgive me for saying this but I was seriously hating on Eren for the first half of this episode and beginning of the second part. I was like "FUCK EREN!! YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!!! SHE KILLED PETRA!!!!" ROAR!!!
This bad bitch needs to die HARD for killing Petra .. I'm still upset over her death. Petra was the closest thing to a moe character Titan had.
@chris49ford Did you forget about Christa (or however her name is spelled)? The goddess?
@bobmonkeys ,, yes true Christa Renz (aka Historia Reiss) does possess some moe qualities .. but she definitely lacks the presence of character that Petra had. Good call, though.
probably because she hardly ever got any scene time? Anyway, strange, maybe a crush on Annie, but all this time I thought to myself, she did all those horrible things yet still, I want to see more of her. There was just too much mystery
@hmmmmname who cares if it was filler? It was still awesome, get over it.
I think after 24 episodes of stressful and horrific events the least this group deserves is a shoujo beach episode.

@zipzo the poster from Megami Magazine: http://s14.postimg.org/q7re2imep/snk.jpg
So basically (going by the start of this conversation at the top of the thread), the only guys here who would have a problem with a muscular girl are the ones who don't have muscles themselves.
She really made Hanji made by killing Sonny and Bean. Bad move.
I thought the Female Titan had the most terrifying face (mostly the eyes) in the series. Hanji's crazy face outdid that like nothin'.
She is my crazyass hero next to Levi
I don't know why but i just laugh when i see Mikasa's eyes when it zooms close to her face when she's talking to Eren XD
lol anyone notice that cat just sitting there like it knows everything going but doesnt give a shit either. lol atleast thats what i see.
I think he's scared more than anything. Eren, SAVE THE CAT!
I can't save anything without sacrificing something. Sorry Kitty.
Damn they really amped things up didn't they like for everything. For once I didn't cry, but damn my chest hurts with all the feels ,and cringing . Was mikasa channeling L those intense looks,i cant get over how adorable/badass armin is.
THANK YOU! I was hoping somebody would say something about that cat.
Meow~ Look what happened to me.
my god another week but was a great episode
Cat is all just chilling, probably thinking, "fucking humans."
let the cliffhanger begin!!

People, for the sake of stirring up enough excitement, STOP TYPIIING!
@ExtraordinaryMuzik exactly, because people who insist on watching only the anime will have to wait months for the rest.
Jfc ppl, everyone is so vengeful and angry DIEDIEDIE to Annie. You saw her crying in titan form right? Do you honestly think she wanted to kill any of them? If you are gonna hate and be angry at anyone, be angry at whoever made her a titan.
I have a strange feeling it was Eren's dad who made her a Titan... I've had a bad feeling about the guy since episode 1...
