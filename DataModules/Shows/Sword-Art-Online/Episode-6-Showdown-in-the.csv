strangely his lady killer abilities got stronger again, he brought her close so naturally.
I want to see Sinons reaction when he tells here that he is a surviver of sao.
I want see what happens when he tells her that he's the famed beater and what happens when he has to face Death Gun
that be awsome cant wait if it happens
Now that someone brought it up, when are they going to get married!?
I know what'll happen. Her strength complex is just gonna make her want to kill him even more
I'm quite surprised sugu hasn't killed kirito yet

I have to reiterate that Sinon doesn't look like that in real life. Say what you will about Asuna, but she is traditionally prettier, and he knows what she looks like face to face. Plus, they have a kid and all that bonding time.
asuna looks better IRL and in game
@ NeonShocker: In real life?
I was thinking that the whole time!
At this point how would Kirto know that Sinon was a girl in real life it could be a guy.
Kirito is such a player, both in game and girls
@cstrboy12 that would be a great idea it might happen
Asuna is the only girl for Kirito, he's just really nice to other chicks
@r3dd34th: Too nice. Asuna is gonna have issues with him about that sooner or later...

YESSSSSSS
Welcome to the Harem Sinon!
Have a pamphlet to read while we get your uniform and name tag.
*IN PAMPHELT* *IN BOLD*"1.DO NOT do anything (romantic) to Kirito in FRONT OF ASUNA! Cuz they are boy/girlfriend IRL and married in game with a kid. PLEASE feel free to do whatever you want with him when Asuna is not around." "2.HOW TO ..."

......
I think Asuna would slap Kirito for holding Sinon like that.
I want everyone in this thread to imagine if all us guys were casually talking about slapping Asuna, for whatever BS reason we came up with. It would not be OK. Handz 2 yo-self ppl!!!
First it was Asuna, then Saachi, then Silica, then Lisbeth, then Suguha, and now Sinon...what do you expect? xD
yes but he always came back to asuna and that wont change though when she finds out his bollocks ill be sore
look SinisterFiveOh, it would not be okay b/c if you guys slapped asuna, her head'll snap back & die. there would be hell to pay. asuna slapping kirito is not okay but it's certainly not going to kill him & no, kirito would never harm asuna
Asuna was busy with a Raid Boss in SAO/ALO. It was YUI that sternly disciplined her dad, Kirito, for his indiscretion.
DEATH GUN: Kirito, I am your fahter
lmao he hates his father
LOOOOOOOL I LAUGHED SO HARD AFTER I READ THIS. The typo kinda made it funnier. xDD
@semajnamssiw Losing his right hand would be a tragedy to him IF he didn't have Asuna...although after what happened between him and Sinon, poor Kirito probably isn't getting laid tonight. Better hope he cleans up for his right hand's sake.
lets remember he lost his hand once before...and it regenerated, lol.
Kirito: "NNNNNOOOOOOOO!!!!!" LOLOLOL
It's been a while since we've seen Kirito flip into berserker mode.

HEY! Do you guys talk physics when you play games, especially MMO's? Now's not the time either lol
Yes, rutherford, I do. Although it's usually to complain along the lines of, "DICE, What the hell did you do to the steering on this thing?! I HAVE ICE CUBES FOR WHEELS!"
"Dice, I don't mean to be nitpicky, but why are your bullet velocities all over the place? and whats with this 'gravity affects some bullets more' crap i have been seeing?" I know your pain all to well daedra
Well, it's not a Hecate, it's actual name is the FR 12.7... fire power second, to that of the DSR 50
It's because math is not real.
oh man! I wish they just put the entire series up in one go and i could just binge watch
Yeah that was some serious flipping out it was done really well. I can really see somebody flipping out and hyperventilating because they know somebody(s) are out there and are going to try to kill you again after all that time but now guns
But then your dopamine receptors would become immune to the SAO awesomeness because you'd be flooding it with too much of a good thing. The waiting keeps you excited and wanting more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BTGgCEFuQw
I've read the Light Novels and Kirito did mentioned about Raiding Laughing Coffin's HQ. But it wasn't really "shown" in the Light Novels. Although, I'm glad that A-1 Pictures actually animated the Raid. Keep it up, A-1.
@ dallnatt same here, I went on a binge read staying up over 24 hours in some cases.
i pretty much binged SAO over two days. its is an awesome series, well, block i was, anways. it will be hard to beat it. still great. DAMNIT, WHY CAN'T I TIME SKIP TO SATERDAYS?!
And the harem grows. Better watch out Asuna

A well-founded confidence. He's never once shown the slightest interest in anyone but her.
They were married, and had a kid. Game over Kirito.
In my hefty experience of watching anime I have learned that harems always grow.
That is one of the Golden Rules of harems!
Asuna: Primary. Sinon: Secondary

@Gene die in a fire

Kirito > Logic
Gotta have a back up... even though Kirito has about 7 or so
Aiming for his left leg? Sinon you liar... you know it was the third
One has to protect his third leg in all occasions.
@anikevin, um.. I do it at ALL TIMES!
She was going to make him a girl.
Anyway that was supposed to be in Rex from Rex Kwon Do voice lol.
Bwahahahahaha! If only I could give you two thumbs up. This comment is hilarious.
Can someone please explain why Kirito refuses to ever mention SAO when he is in the game? And, do people not Google? I would think the name Kirito would be pretty well known throughout MMORPG games
People weren't instantly killed when they died in SAO. There was a ten second delay or so before their brain was fried. That's why Asuna didn't die, because Kirito cleared the game before she could.
It could also be that kayaba decided to make her not complete the death process for a set amount of time as per the request of kirito
I think that everyone forgets the air of uncertainty regarding death in SAO when it was still active. There was no actual proof that when you died in SAO, you died irl. At least not to the SAO players themselves, as outside communication wa
s prohibited. I bet a lot of LC members used that uncertainty of the finality of death in SAO as justification for their actions in the game. Even though they had no problem with murder in SAO, don't assume that killing irl would be easy.
If he told them about SAO, people would know exactly who he is and would be able to train themselves to be stronger than him. Thus it would become next to impossible for him to do well in GGO.
Ah, shared PTSD. I never thought that would be way to woo a girl.
Man...I just don't want this to stop. Why must I wait another week!? This is torture! Also, I heard Sinon and Kirito don't get romantic with each other, but it seems she's gonna be like another liz. Side line babe waiting for Asuna to leave

One girlfriend, and 4 bitches. What a player.. LITERALLY
He's the beater, gets all the bitches. You might say he's the bitch beater. Wait now it sounds like I'm condoning domestic violence.
I think we all know when someone says that it's impossible for Kirito, Kirito always breaks that barrier.
He fought in SAO for two years and climbed to the top of the rankings there. That experience has since translated into becoming a warrior.
Well, at least confident...
Na, the author just likes to make his main character over powered.
Deus Ex Machina to the rescue! Because it has saved every Shonen or Shonen-esque character since forever. I'm kidding, but if you can tell by now, he will overcome anything that he comes across. I would gamble my life savings on that, kiddo
i dont think an OP character is nessesarly a bad thing. its all how you do it.
Will Sinon finally take Kirito as a friendly gesture? Would Asuna be furious if he saw Kirito do that to another girl? Find OUT NEXT TIME on...Kirito's wonderful of Harem!
Somehow I don't think Asuna would like that bit at the end.
@Stewker its cuz they made her seem incapable of protecting herself as if kirito wasnt around she'd of died long ago. only cuz they made her seem so weak compared to kirito towards the end which she was much more independent in the begining
had they shown a couple scenes of her maybe solo killing a decent scary looking mob to maybe collect dinner materials as a surprise meal for kirito so something along that. i think most people would feel differently about her
@OmenofOmega, In Volume 1 of SAO, there's a scene that shows Asuna going agro on labyrinths 1 month into the game.
That was SAO progress vol 1
@bulletprooff1k Lol. I just noticed that. XD
Kirito...still smooth with the ladies...lol
