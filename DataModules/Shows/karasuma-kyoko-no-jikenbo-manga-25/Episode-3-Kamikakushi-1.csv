The wordlessly changing scenes are expressive, but you have to pay attention. At first, it made no sense to me, but a rewatch cleared it up for me. The story is getting deeper, but the VA was hit & miss, & took away from the enjoyment.
I'm certain this series is aimed at an acquired taste, I feel like the show gives you so much that you feel time slow down; maybe because it reminds me more a graphic novel then a anime, I didn't notice these wordless scenes.
