Heck yeah lmfao.
Er... so, more subbed episodes are coming, right? Because it's like 40 or 60 or some ungodly number of episodes to Kyoto and I am *not* watching them dubbed.
Glad to hear more subbed episodes are coming, nothing against dubs but I grew up on the Japanese voices.
Already here it seems, all of them.

Thanks! I just love hearing the little voice-cracks in "Oro?!"
"No officer, this is not a sword, this is obviously a light truck."
Sanosuke!!!! The second best character in there series!!!
But Saito is such a badass.
I wonder if Masato of Little Busters! was inspired by Sanosuke? Big muscles, bigger heart...
Spiky hair...
Man this is show is still great, but it just occurred to me that... I mean, it'd prolly be better for Sanosuke to take up some kid of martial arts with that absurd strength of his, I mean that big ass sword can't be practical.
People are talking of Dubs....but where s the dubbed option because Knshin's voice is obviously a Japanese girl -_-
"I felt a presence, that I did" are fighters in this series like the immortals from Highlander?
Man this anime has some amazing characters.
The intro song is so good (:
Sword looked like it was made out of stone
oh these are hard subs. =|
Skip intro at 1:35
Best walking scene in anime ever created :3
I love Rurouni Kenshin
Maybe TMI, but when I was younger, I had a manga-crush on Sanosuke lol. He and Kenshin were my favorite characters in the manga. Kaoru is pretty awesome, too.
"I'm sure that you won't ever find a guy that would marry you!" After reading the manga for the last arc that was never animated, this is quite interesting.
