"Will you protect me forever?" Get in line Sinon

That's right! There was a camera in that cave! All the GGO players that were watching were probably like, "Sinon + Kirito = Yuri!!"
@shaddar english is a proper noun
@emilymosterkitten English is a proper noun, english is incorrect.
Not being funny this is the internet, people can spell how the bloody well please.
all i can picture is Asuna hair flying everywhere with flames behind her and she's "KIIIIRIIIIITOOOOO!!!!" angrily or she has a calm smiling face while saying "Kirito-kun"
she would have a calm demeanor..."Kirito kun...we need to talk...(sharpens knife) :)"
My God Epicuriandreams Thats Murder Already XD
"KIIRRRRIIIITTOOOO!!!!" or "Kirito kun" Either way, he's doooommmed.
Except she knows he already picked her
yeah... i think asuna is pretty confident and secure with their connection, at least enough that she wouldn't freak out lol. though the previously mentioned scenarios are still freakin hilarious
Sinon realised after 10 minutes of hitting Kirito that she had killed him by witling down his health
@KayTana it did by hurting her hand
I loled for real when I though of this scenario.
I've always wondered what the official difference is between a hard slap in SAO and something like the time Kirito killed his attacker by using his bare hand to do a sword art ability. The game could obviously tell there was a difference.
Oh! And that'ld be the second time Kirito got a hand imprinted on his VR face! LOL
@Aldones The LN explains that he picks up an 'unarmed combat' skill set somewhere along the way. The same quest is the reason his informant had cat whiskers drawn on her face . . . it makes sense in context

He was hit by Gunner X.
@KenobiSon yea, but... they are at ep10 and this is like significantly through the books (there are 2) and there are supposed to be 24ep. what are they going to do after hum... i am guessing at this rate 2-6ep at most? ep from rosario?
It never said they spent a whole week just checking the stadium
@yousif It was a joke about how we waited one week in between episodes and he did those things off-screen at the ending/beginning of the episodes. We all know that they weren't there for a literal week.
he ended SAO...
I'm just waiting for Sinon to realize she's in love with Kirito and then find out about Asuna and Yui... That will be ugly...
I'm not really into Kirito as a hero. It feels like this anime is all about how many females he can wrangle and leave out to dry. Sinon was way cooler than Kirito before the last few episodes.
@Biggle Queen ment he would feel the wrath of the mother and daughter for having an affair behind the family's back XD
I think the problem comes from Kirito NOT SAYING THAT HE ALREADY HAS A GIRLFRIEND! Up until Asuna in SAO, he merely made friends, but every female friend he makes falls in love with him, but I don't think it's mutual.
lol im just sitting here wondering if they can see all of that on the in-game video feed
Oh no, it's the part that Asuna and Yui finds out about Sinon that's really Ugly huehuehue
Klein during this: "Damn you Kirito! Why does everything good happen to you?!"
Oh, I noticed that in the first series, with every female character he helped falling for him. Hah. That doesn't bother me, as Kirito himself isn't treating it like a harem.
true
Kirito is pretty awesome
Who is Klein?
really hate how every time a male protagonist finds a bunch of female friends it's automatically a 'harem.' They all know that 1. he's committed to Asuna and 2. he doesn't return their feelings.
"SAO Survivor"... your a bit more then that Kirito, more like the "SAO Liberator".
Only a few people know that he released the Seed, and only Asuna knows about the Heathcliff ID.
He pretty much open pandora's box because he wanted to play vrmmos lol
@Mexider Why is the company sketchy? Because they won't divulge private information about it's users to a random government that just so happened to want it? That could be just as destructive as Death Gun himself...
No Kirito isnt a "SAO Suvivor" he is a "VRMMO God"!!
not sure the ID would even work in GGO, yeah it comes from the seed, but ALO was specifically stated to have borrowed heavily from SAO. then there is the implication that Heathcliff is still alive on the net to some extent if not entirely

@dougeprofile What you just said contradicts. You say irreligious people are more barbaric, though you also say ISIS revels in that. If you fail to see the contradiction and think Christianity is the only religion... I feel sorry for you.
@Wyndeon Even if you combine all religions together (nuts since they're all unique worldviews) it doesn't equal the number of people who have been killed in the name of secular statism in the 20th century. ISIS is just playing catch up.
Nothing says evil like riding a robot horse.
Pale horse of the apocalypse, and its rider death. Hue hue muh biblical allegories.
all that was missing was his western bad guy hat and an evil laugh as he gains ground on them
It would of been more awesome if he was set on fire and so was the horse and they were being chased down by that, then play a song similar to Ghost Riders in the Sky.
@Spacemarine58 that's what I was thinking too!
Actually I'm pretty sure the whole bit is an homage to "On a Pale Horse", by Piers Anthony.
how many times am i going to hear and see the raid party footage
@DarkVoltron seriously. You'd think that event would be a pretty big one shown in the last season considering how bent up Kirito is about it...
@Resident_Gundam Humeray flashbacks are Marito's version of 'nam flashbacks
I'm glad that A-1 Pictures actually animated the Raid. I read the Light Novels and Kirito did mentioned it, but it wasn't "shown" in the Light Novels. For how they did so far as a whole... They better not fuck up like 8-Bit did with IS2...
Actually, while they did make it up to fit this story, they did introduce it neatly enough. Posting it as his first kill, and basically PTSD.
They make a bit of a bigger deal out of it in the LN and explained it a bit better. They might still in a future eps but unknown for now. I recommend you guys check out the book after this season though! Next arc is also great!
Dat lap pillow >.< Imagine if this is being broadcasted and Asuna is watching LOL
actually it's being watched live.
The Scan doesn't work because, that's for the people in the game. What kind of big Tournament doesn't have coverage anywhere on the map? What if they battled into the cave? "Sorry *NO SIGNAL* In The Game WE Created Because Of....... Cave"
I think the crows are what are used to broadcast. I didnt see any in or around the cave
Clarification; Asuna's not watching. She was watching the match last episode in ALO, but then signed off because... You'll find out later. But all in all, Asuna's NOT watching what's going on in the cave with Kirito and Sinon.
So she was in a game watching the progress of another game?!! Can you take a break from shooting people in GGO & sit down to watch some pixies on dragons take down flying fairies ?!
Love how Kirito totally downplays how he was actually the best player and actually was the one who freed everyone
We don't actually even know if Kirito really WAS the best. One of the best perhaps. What everybody knew was that he was a SOLO player and it took more skill and guts to do so.
Heathcliff straight up tells him he's the best. It's why he was given dual-weild, and tells him "you were always meant to face me in the end"

In my mind, there are three people in SAO. The SAO liberators; the frontline soldiers who worked to clear the dungeons. The SAO survivors, who were the merchants, etc. And the SAO escaped convicts, who were murderers trying to ruin the game
That's not the way he thinks, in his mind he was just doing what he needed to do, nothing special.


Yes, but all the other girls are watching, and it focuses on the fights. So they all saw him princess carry the girl to safety. Don't think Asuna won't hear about it
Hey, I read the light novels too, Scowly. You don't have to spoil it for the non-readers.
@Scowly that was a spoiler disguised as a "The World God Only Knows" References right...
Yeah Scowly some of us want to "see" it play out! Spoile it for yourself but don't ruin it for the rest of us! BAKA!! >:P
Oh Kirito, somehow you always know how to manipulate people's psychology, Mr. "I'll Shoot it With You"...
"...Just the tip."
It's never just the tip.
The profile pic...and then the username....XD Well played, colon013.
"I hate you, but let me lean against you." You're so romantic Sinon
Weird sense of romance, this one.
It's called a tsundere, buddy.
@akumanomi that's not what your avatar is saying XD
Yeah, chick logic... just try not to understand and go with the flow.
Writer's logic, actually.
it's a good thing that the tournament probably shows the people that are fighting cause if the girls saw Sinon lean agains Kirito he would have some explaining to do. now I have to wait a week to see the action


He had like 3 girls in SAO!
soufen - but the majority of Bond girls die that he likes which is why he always gets a new one
@wrek 4. Liz, Silica, Sachi, and Asuna.
Dear A1 Pictures, Anime episodes are supposed to be roughly 24 minutes. Please stop making 5 minute episodes.
Na-uh. I don't care that the clock said 10:00am PST when the episode finished. It definitely wasn't 24 minutes.
It just doesn't feel like it was 24-25 minutes. I was watching the episode then all of a sudden it was over in 15 minutes but it was actually 24 mins.
They must have a time perception-manipulating dude employed just to fuck with us.
the show itself is only 20 minutes, you have to count the fact that the opening theme and ending theme are both 2 minutes and change a piece. so... yea still only seemed like a 5 minute show
They were talking in that cave for like 15 minutes!!!!
This episode ended way too fast :c
true
No. This episode just went way too slowly.
all the episodes end to fast
Why can't episodes be a hour long like the walking dead or under the dome or other American shows?
Im calling how Death gun dies, in their final fight death gun will some where along the line drop his pistol and Kirito or Sinon will pick it up and shoot him with his own gun. actually the more i think about it it will be sinon will do it
Then in excitement, Shinon accidentally kills Kirito. Series ends, all remaining arcs are nullified.
Good prediction. Unless Death Gun is someone we know from the real world. Then that would be seriously f-ed up.
i love these comments ^
My prediction is similar, but add to it an enemy accomplice who stays in the real world and does all the actual real life killings. Not sure who would get the most poetic justice rights to defeat them in the end, though. Asuna maybe?
ooooor, she will get the gun, and choose NOT to kill him
Lmao at 'You already live inside me.' What a smooth operator you are Kirito-kun, your player skills are truly unprecedented. I be sure to use that next time.
He was waiting for the moment to ask her to let him live inside her. Then get to what every male in anime does in caves when they are alone with a main female character. But she started punching him instead and the mood was lost.
I support Sinon as long as the harem ending is enabled. If it comes to Asuna-Sinon-Leafa-Liz-Silica, I'd rather Asuna > Everyone else.
Intabus - I don't normally humor this nature of comment, but I see where this is going. He would be in a cave within a cave. Cave-ception.
Yoo Google or someone start make games like this people
