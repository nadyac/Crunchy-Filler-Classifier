"You know why" "Because I was born into this world" Such strong will Eren has, that is why I love they way he is.

@Rayray To add to that logic if your out numbered you can't lose. If it's one vs. one, be prepared for a epic fight.
Sir! We're surrounded! ------ Excellent! We can attack in any direction!
i feel sorry for jean... he just wants to live lol and he always is in the thick of it
what the fuck was that when eren turned with that face and punched the shit out of that building
Dr. Armin; one of the many therapists you'll have once the giants break into your walls.
Damn, Armin sure grew some balls in the past few episodes. Enormous respect for the kid.
Had one of those when I was a kid.... I'll never see them the same way again. Thanks.
@DeadlyOats Comment of the year right here.
I was thinking the same thing
I believe that was from South Park, if I'm not mistaken, but still funny as shit.
DeadlyOats made my day by just saying that. Laughed so hard by the way he says it.


@larryfilth we should get the Amish, i work at an amish furniture company, and they will get the boulder moved, shape it, add intricate detail, and put a weather proofing on it by the time Mikasa can kill the next Titan!

@DuckQuickly You're an incest child aren't you?
lmao haidi i dont doubt it ive seen em work they took out about a mile wide area full of trees in about 4 hours
Mikasa blushing :))))
Mikasa has a brother complex >.<
i love how many different formes of love are featured in AoT :3

Mikasa has a crush on Eren this whole time! >_<
Mikasa has a deep unconditional love for Eren. She's shy to show her true feelings so she masquerades them by saying he's her "family". Family? Maybe family as in husband lol. It's soo cute, she really fell in love with him when she met him
Attack on Cliffhangers
[This comment has been removed]
Hey better than it being Attack on Plot-holes or Attack on Filler Episodes.
the second season will have tons of fillers....backstories :}
Oh... will they?
Would rather have Attack on Filler than Attack of Filler Episodes.

I feel ya!
If i could i would leave it a few weeks so didn't have to suffer the cliff hangers all the time....but...to addictive waiting 1 week is long enough haha
Hence why I love coming into an anime that's already done. NO NEED FOR WAITING! But yeah, some of them just can't be stopped: you have to watch til the end.
The day they change the opening will be the saddest day of my life
Same goes for the ending for me.
Yeah, the first opening is usually best, seems like. Hard to imagine AoT managing to one-up this one.
Both songs on this are perfect: the opening for setting the tension of the anime, and the ending song...idk, it just seems to emphasize the fragment of hope they hold on to. That saying, I don't understand a word of it, so I could be wrong.
I LOVE THEM BOTH, I FIND MYSELF NOT SKIPPING AND JUST SITTING THERE LISTENING.
Everyone complaining about the "slow pace," keep this in mind: the manga is a monthly one, do you want the anime to catch up with the manga? See how well that ended with blue exorcist. This isn't slow at all, they cover over 50 pgs in 1 ep.
I don't think it's slow at all! As someone who's read the manga, every episode is like one chapter! And like some anime today, they could just take a break for one of the Seasons, then come back the next. Heck, Gintama took 2 1 year breaks!
Wait, people say this show is... too slow? What???
I watch one 25 min episode, and it feels like 5 mins. AND PEOPLE SAY IT'S SLOW! O.e
I have absolutely no problem with the pacing. It is just right for this series.
In my opinion it's moving almost too fast! But in a way that keeps me wanting more *-*

Jean is one stand up guy. He has emerged as a hero for his people.
Given what they are facing, having warm bodies present at all is a major feat of courage and tenacity for humanity. It takes a lot of internal strength to overcome the primal fear of being eaten alive: a fate to which few of us can relate.
The reluctant hero is a nice archetype. Jean seems to be very shrewd and makes the hard decisions, even if he doesn't really like them. Definitely a personality I like to see.

Oh this show.... Nothing happens, but everything happens. And still it's awesome every week. Love this show!
Hah, I did the same thing and watched 5 episodes in a row, It was over for me after that, waiting was out of the question.
lol I just marathoned the first 12 episodes
So did I =)
I'm sadly not a good waiting person so i always wind up wasting the day of the release pressing the refresh button to watch it the moment its updated I'm a sad person I know. ;(
I only just got into it and it is awesome being able to watch it mostly all at once. I am dreading getting up to date only because it will become a weekly torture, lol!!
That moment as a kid when you opened your Christmas gift and you got what you wanted=the moment the AoT countdown reaches zero. Mikasa's blush made my day.
Mikasa so brave!!! I'm totally surprised she did that!!!
My favorite part of this episode was the focus on Mikasa's eyes when ordered to leave Eren behind. There were actually quite a few great close up shots that delivered some real emotion. I can really appreciate an anime that gets that right.
@ Trahma, just wanna let you know, awesome fraggin profile pic you have. That game was so fun. Definitely looking forward to that studio's next title, The Transistor
@Dragon You may not care, but Bastilon was also released for GNU/Linux which is definitely helping get Steam some AAA games for their Steam box and Linux as a whole. Nice to see something worth while before the junky Xbone and the okay PS4.
yea, i loved her eyes when they got scary
What is really cool about that whole thing is that the leader of the Elite Corps was more afraid of what she would do, then of fighting all those Titans.
^ NEVER get between a woman and her man!
Why do I watch AoT? Because I was born into this world, why else?
Seems like Armin is one of the only people who really gets anything done around here.


they were always green owo were they not? still, next episode should be promising.
why AOT always gimme a heart attack at their endings? Armin is showing importance in the last 3 episodes...
How to grab your best friends attention? Stab him in the arm and whisper sweet nothings into his ear.....lol
