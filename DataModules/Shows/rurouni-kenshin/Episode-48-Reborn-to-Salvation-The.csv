This is honestly among the best anime I've ever seen. The action and pacing is great, the philosophical aspect is always interesting and never overbearing, and the characters have a real depth to them- It's great!!
Even more so because they can't go back.
This always makes me tear. Anji its one of my favorite characters of all.
SANO!!!!!!!!!!
he aint dead lol..... that poor monk he even wore her ashes under his eyes like kratos now thats badass
Him punching Bhudha in the face was quite reminiscent of Kratos punching Zeus in the face. To death.


Great episode. The only issue I have with the show is the score and incidental music. The music that starts at 12:15, and has been used in earlier episodes, is basically a derivation of the Terminator theme, and too simple and repetitive.
