Wait a minute, did Hannes transfer to the Survey Corps? I know he was in the Garrison 5 years ago, but he has the wings of the Survey Corps on his arms and back now!
@Ramenth, No the animators just screwed up, he is still part of the Garrison Corps.
It's 2;39AM here and I have to get up at 7AM :-( WHY!!!! SO good!!!!

JEEZ! who did they base the Army trainer off a serial murder lmfao? I was scared shitless when i saw his eyes at the doors.
I think all drill sergeants take time to learn "Intimidating as [expletive]." It's like a pre-req for the job. Though, he seems to have surpassed that, into the full "aura from hell" perk..
That door scene? He reminds me of the ghost that appear in horror movies. xD
He reminded me of Palm from HxH.
weird.... at this part... i laughed, and screamed " OH SH-- PEDOPHILE!" o-o... i mean... seriously .... the dude was peeking through a door with a facial expression of Disgust, and... "Intent" ....
I've dealt with scary MTI's before, but "scary" doesn't begin to describe that guy. ... Damn. Our military could use a person or two like him.
When he said" Hey there, it's been five years."...shit just got real!
ME TOO OMG GKNGCGKDJDS
When it appeared, I felt a jolt of fear run through me... 0_0;
Yup, I thought it was him thinking back to the first time he saw it. Man, these kids can't catch a break. They were just excited about eating some meat and then the Titan showed up
When the Colossal Titan showed up, I imagined him saying "'Suprise Motherfucka"

That "Now you Go Reiner" facial expression had me rolling on the floor, lol the most epic pissed off face ever!
I'd spend a few days with her tossing me around if I could.
Gigity... but no seriously a few days of that with her and you would almost be a deaths door.
@relkin43 oh? damn, i wanna read the manga but im enjoying watching the anime way too much. i cant do both xD just the way i am. but thank you for clearing that up. i was like wtf lol
@Caeneth "almost at death's door", he'll be in death bed.
Eren's face is scary......hahahaha
What!? Potato Girl is evolving! Your Potato Girl has evolved into Meat Girl! Seriously though this cliffhanger is killing me. The moment that the lest few episodes have been building up to finally comes, and then the credits roll.
Seriously it's torture ;_;
She went from Potato Girl to Bread Girl first, then Meat Girl. Meat Girl is her Ultimate form, can't wait to see Mega.
Potato Girl deserves her own spinoff series!
Maybe she can eat some titan meat, yum
pay attention students: hihou suru means fart in japanese.. now go out into the world and start a conversation!!
@a11jks Doumo arigatou, sensei.
She already does. It's called Legend of Korra.
Potato girl was really getting off on that package of meat.

3d gear looks pretty cool in motion.

I want that 3D gear
No Gintoki, you need to have at least a teeny bit of maturity to use it.
Next episode is going to be insane!! Cant wait.

my chest is pounding and my breathe is fierce!

That's why they split it into parts.

Well.... I'm off to bed.... Wake me up when it's Sunday again.
hey wake up its sunday dude!!!!!! but i think we have to wait a lil longer so never mind go back to sleep
Potato girl...still the best

AcidK - we all get that you've read the manga. Now please shut up - don't even use the spoiler button because that's for spoilers from THIS episode, not spoilers for the whole series. Just keep it buttoned - we don't want to know, okay?
@mistersaxon: Thank you. I assume it's safe to click the show spoiler button after I have seen the episode. I almost don't want to read the comments anymore because of all the manga people who feel the need to ruin shit for everyone else
Find fine, will remove the comments.
The music at the end when she is on the wall with them, when she shows the meat was awesome. At first it has bagpipes and then what sounds like a fiddle, the music sounded like it came from the tv series, "Firefly." The music is awesome.
Herro I'm back
...heard you all talking about meat, mind if I have a slice
That titan practically is meat and bones.
bones make good soup
That guy could probably feed the entire city once or twice.

Having read the manga I feel I can say that Attack on Titan is much better suited to anime format. Not that the manga is bad or anything.
To all of the people who have read the manga. Please shut your damn mouths about it. I want to read the comments without you ruining the story. The spoiler button only pertains to this episode. Not spoilers in general. Thank you.
I know what you mean. That's why right now I'm very careful on reading comments. I usually only read comments with high rating because spoilers rarely have high ratings.
No you're wrong, spoilers are about AFTER the episode (including manga). If everything which refers to the episode has to be marked as spoiler, well, then all comments would be spoilers... I prefer not having to click each of them to read.
Simple watch the episode first, then read/write comments about it. It's logical.
"Oh look, such a peaceful ending" *Lightning Strikes* "Shit just got real...."
Just let loose a hungry Sasha and she'll eat all the Titans.
Think Eren's motivated? Just let Sasha see you put some salt and pepper on the Titans and it's all over.
I love the fact that this show has really strong female characters in leading roles which is something we rarely see in anime. This show is awesome.
