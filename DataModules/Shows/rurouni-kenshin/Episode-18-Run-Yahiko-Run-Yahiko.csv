Those poor nuts
And Gohei's balls too.

What are they going to break on that guy next, his feet?
I guess they could like...Stitch his lips together, then use fire to fuse them together XD

The episode preview picture is the best part of this episode, for me. I don't even know how to describe that expression!
Let's use the wood splinters to slowly cut the rope....instead...of....the sword....
Battosai the manslayer... meet Yahiko the Nutcracker!
When Yahiko used "kimi" on Kaoru while waving his foot at her I almost died. How impudent yet so damn funny! xD
I think a nut broke.. not sure
oh the ending feels!
gohei agen!? gosh what is this a super hero show?
cannot get enough of the opening!!!!!!!!!!!
