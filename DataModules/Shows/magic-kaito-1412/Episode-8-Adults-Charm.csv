Lucifer is like...who dares summon me? Akako is like...shutup, I got what I wanted so get out of my face.
Kid, your greatest illusion is how you stayed on that tightrope wearing rocket powered rollerskates and a cape that was obviously being blown around by a heavy wind!!!
And yet somehow he still can't manage to ice skate 2 feet without falling on his face.
Logic lol Maybe it's psychological and he doesn't notice he CAN ice skate lol
I'm still dumbfounded how he survived that fall last episode...
Maybe he can Ice Skate, and he just pretends he can't. Sort of like how he is with pool.
That moment when you realize Lucifer knew who the Kaito Kid was (including what he'd be doing later that week), but did not know who hell summoned him....
Do you know where episodes 9 and 10 disappeared? did he use magic?!
Standard for that sort of summoning, part o the spell. Ya don't want that sort knowing it was you that called'm up.
summoner using restricted chants/spells
Its old magic. If you know someone's name, you'll have power over them.
That moment when you realize Lucifer tricked her into making fun of herself.
how?
My guess is this: He knew what was going to happen and thus knew she would make a fool of herself and be unable to do it.

LOL!!! THAT WIPE OUT EVERYTHING AND STUPID LAUGH PART JUST CRACKED ME UP
Man, Kaito. The shit you say to Aoko. It's cool when you're a supersauve thief, dude, but as a highschooler, you need a punch in the balls.
Akako should hurry up and notice she is in love with Kaito.
So, he can pull those stunts on rocket roller blades, but he can't skate, or even walk on ice? okay Kaito.

y no episode 9 and 10
wtf where are episodes 9 and 10? Did they number them wrong? or should I check another website?
CR only started this show with the second season. They're releasing two S1 episodes each week along with the new simulcast. It's right there in "Availability Notes" at the top of the right-hand column under the video window on this page.
I love how this show seems to have forgotten its own continuity, Akako should have lost her powers forever, now she lost it forever again lol

he's some high level sorceress or a Winchester with binding and cloaking spells to block that demon XD maybe the devil is powerless against Tsundere girls unlike Kid which is why he cant be charmed by her XD he just teases her naturally
were is episode 9 and 10
Idk if i'm super into this sorceress running around every other episode like a girl on her period...
