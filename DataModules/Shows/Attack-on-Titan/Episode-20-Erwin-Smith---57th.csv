Well this anime sure knows how to punch you in the junk and the end of each episode...



I love a good punch to the vagina.
I love a good vagina lol
Great job Hanji... AIM FOR THE BUTT! Bl

^pretty sure that was reiner.
"Does that mean you sprayed it everywhere while mid-air?"

"Shut up, do u think ur on a picnic? We're outside the walls... I didnt piss my pants either, Eren. o///o" Haha your argument was invalid after you you told Eren that.
That's the most disgusting question Eren Jaeger had ever asked! Oh man.
I used to be a titan, but then I encountered Captain Levi and Eren Yaeger,


could be her. most definitely. but she is not there because she is military police
Did you not see that ass? That's Annie!
i thought Annie joined the MP o.O

Did anyone else realize that the three main characters symbolize the three main components of human beings? Armin = Mind Mikasa = Body Erin = Spirit Maybe I'm just late to realize this, either way I found it interesting to say the least.
Bladerah150 I didn't know either.
cool!!

Love this anime so much omg.
So, they're basically the Triforce?
I fear the cliffhanger for episode 25. Waiting a week is painful waiting for the next season is going to be agonizing.
shit, the manga's even worse - it's a MONTHLY release.... and it has plenty story left to tell
If it ends up where I think it will, it'll be one heck of a cliffhanger, but it will also be an epic way to finish off the season IMO. I can hardly wait!
I'll be reading the Manga the moment it does... That's what I've done with a lot of anime.
I know what part you guys are talking about.
Seriously - don't read ahead. You will ruin watching it for yourself...
Was whistling the first opening at work today and a coworker recognized it and we started talking about the show. *Massive fist pump*
My coworker is manga reader, and he spoiled the whole female titan's identity to me. Although my guess was correct.
Imagine if it was your boss. One week later, I have noticed you work hard.Raise
epic WIN
People at my work suck and make fun of me for watching anime.... Oh well their loss haha
You got that right, it is agonizing
Intense, suspense, what else? This episode is perfect.
So Petra...DID you spray it everywhere midair? Important question.
Did they really have to fire arrows in to that titans ass? Kinky survey corps.
they should launch a tree up her ass
@IglePigle To be honest, Hanji kind of puts off subtle lesbian vibes to me. :x Or maybe that's just my imagination.
No. More like the type that takes pleasure in giving and getting pain.
@DeadlyOats Should'a been guessed that Oats. You see how Hanji tied up Bean and tested him. Even gave him a break with the sleep over camping. Hanji knows how to treat em well an keep em in check.
@Snowmand000777 You know? Now that I think of it, that also makes her an exhibitionist. She routinely has her troops in formation, watching the "experiments."
Ummm...now would be a good time to bite your hand Eren.
But the Spy is also obviously trained to kill Titans so It's somewhat a bad idea too.
But the spy wants Eren alive, so she wouldn't kill him.

She wouldn't kill him but who;s to say she won't kill the titan.... the body that is.
What would have made my day is if all those titans that were running, ran like girls as they did in other episodes.

that actually turned out roughly the way I was anticipating. the person attacking looked to be well prepared ahead of time with info and strategies. the commander was thinking the same thing I was as well after the screams drew the titans.

And that kid's. Is how I met your titan.
I'm not sure there are any words in existence that can describe how Awesome this show is!
Imagine how EPICALLY mind-blowing of a live action movie this would be?!? (If Hollywood doesn't f*** it up). I'd pay ridiculous IMAX prices to see it in 3D. 5 times.
A Movie?! Really? Well after James Cameron (Avatar & the upcoming sequals) is done with Battle Angel Alita I hope he gets a nod to direct it or Joss Wheadon (Avengers) or Paul Verhoven (Robo Cop, 1st Total Recall & Starship Troopers)
No. No way! They are not about to make a movie..... they'll ruin it so hard.
So, why'd I got 4 thumbs down for my previous post and not a single comment to add their opinion - i posted to hear what others think, just getting thumbed dwn is lame - Speak up or plant you thumb elsewhere!
I'd prefer a game.
Gunna be a long ass movie
NOW I HAVE TO WAIT TIL NEXT WEEK NUUUUUUUUU :C

spymoft => There are things in the anime I never noticed in the manga, if they were even there. Watch from 16:40 for a few seconds and tell me if you don't raise your eyebrows.
At least you you're a member. ;-)
@albedo21 I guess i'm blind because I didn't notice anything unusual.
I posted previously that the manga is a monthly release so once you get caught up you will still be left wanting MORE! like a strung out Titan junkie & just be back her posting... wait a min... I need a life :G
HOOOLLLYYYY SHHHHHIIIIIZZZZZNNNIIITTTTT
does that mean you sprayed it everywhere while sitting down?
ahhahsahsdah WHATTTTTTT
Uh - oh xD
Oh shit.. that piss joke going to be floating around for awhile..
Unless it hits a tree. Well no....it would really soak in. Everyone would see it for much longer then.
Every episode keeps getting better, I really did not see that one coming lol
This is why you don't talk to your captive and tell him/her what you plan to do... I suppose they couldn't have predicted what she did, but surely they expect the unexpected at this point. Oh well.
I think they wanted to protect her, or hurt her. Either way, it looks bad for them.
