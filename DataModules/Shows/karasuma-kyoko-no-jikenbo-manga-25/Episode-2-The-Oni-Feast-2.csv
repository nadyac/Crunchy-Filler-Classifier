I actually like this series, and its dubbed. Rare enough wonder on Crunchyroll, I like the way the art style is done for the animation and think its a refreshing change of pace from the usual fan service or copycat anime we're subjected to
I still can't WATCH this series. But I do enjoy listening to it, the animated storybook style puts me off, but turn off the monitor and all is good.
The story got kind of weird for a bit, but it wasn't a bad episode. The voice acting improved a little bit over the last episode, and I was able to watch this episode without my right eye twitching from some of the flatly delivered lines.
Dear CR, I actually appreciate the new premium content even though it's dubbed and technically not an anime. In the end you've added value to my subscription and look forward to content updates daily. Please keep up the fun!
