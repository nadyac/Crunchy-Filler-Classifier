honestly among best anime ive ever seen action pacing great philosophical aspect always interesting never overbearing characters real depth its great even more so because cant go back always makes tear anji its one favorite characters all sano aint dead lol poor monk even wore her ashes under his eyes like kratos now thats badass him punching bhudha face quite reminiscent kratos punching zeus face death great episode only issue show score incidental music music starts 1215 used earlier episodes basically derivation terminator theme too simple repetitive
