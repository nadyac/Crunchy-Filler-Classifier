Is it bad I wants to do that toooooooo? D:
I think everyone wants to do that I know I would
If I could turn demon every time I unsheathed a sword... I would sit in front of a mirror, and do exactly what Amaimon was doing xD
He has his own special Clapper "Lights on, Lights off"
LCS17, i totally agree with u


THAT WAS AWSOME


The useless characters always end up powerful in anime, i expected something like this, but it doesn't make it any less awesome !
Ya know, there are very few male anime characters that can really make a pink Yukata work for them. Mephisto is one of them.
The person who plays that new female character also plays Misaka Mikoto in a certain scientific railgun
The episodes are getting pretty prevery and not to mention the love story with them
Mephisto is awesome <3
I lurve mephisto and amaimon TOO. DAMn. MUCH.

7:19 Anyone notice the "go to hell" sign on the rollercoaster?

Wow...Who pissed in your cornflakes? ^^^
^ Satan did.
Ewwww................ I wonder if his piss is blue O_O?
Kinda hard to miss that sign, no? Worth a comment nonetheless
My boyfriend and I watch this anime together but I never confessed to him how hot I think Rin is

Japanese animation is designed to emphasize the beautiful parts of the human body, so things like nails, hairs on arms/legs/face are left out. Notice how there are not many old or over-weight people in Anime as well.
Unless they are suppose to be
and the old people have aged really well
and don't forget the old people are usually crazy strong and agile a shit
'GO TO HELL'~Best advertising call to action I've ever seen! Love it!
HOLY Crap, Can a Hoody hide so much.... Impossible XD
wtfff Wasnt what I was expecting 0_o
Like Assassin's Creed

That's way she had the bandage suppressing her chest lol
You'd actually be surprised at how clothes can make boobs look smaller...although baggy clothes tend to de-emphasize your boobs by making you look fat all over instead of skinnier.
Rin: "What do you mean?You know you were just staring at Shiemi's boo-" SMACK! "THAT HURT, FOUR EYES!" That was funny! LMAO
"You little pervert! I wanna' squeeze 'em too..."
I lol'd when I saw that as well. Ha!
Wow, that bra top was incredibly too small for someone as big chested as her!
well she has to have room to pull out the sword...
That's not a bra, it's a bikini top. XD

yup. shiemi is just too cute! just so goofy and funny
I'm glad they didn't make her boobs larger than life that really pisses me off
great another girl that whears barely nothing --_--
You'd think that Japan would be tired of it by now .__.
you can never get tired of girls wearing almost nothing
Tea cups of death lol
Anime gives you unrealistic expectations on how large boobs are affected by gravity. =(
LOVE THE SOUDTRACK TO THIS ANIME!!!
Please tell me im not the only person who thinks Amaimon is smokin hot.
You are far from alone... A good number of people find him sexy.
what a pervy child lol
big difference without the kimono
i never get tired of the opening :p
i was just thinking hey that's probably a girl...
