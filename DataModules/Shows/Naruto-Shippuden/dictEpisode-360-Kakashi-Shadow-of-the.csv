very deep episode feel like can understand kakashi better now see him first couple episodes naruto differently naruto picture made laugh lol made day~ such beautiful episode made smile so much especially lol 20082023 kakashi blushing im so proud his students learned came back him lightening his heart bit by bit thought weird pervert first such beautiful episode made smile so much especially lol 20082023 kakashi blushing im so proud his students learned came back him lightening his heart bit by bit woah just realized episode 360 360 degrees circle made full circle right back beginning naruto very nice observation dayum thatsjust amazing show even more awesome little surprising element well would beginning naruto shippuden not original naruto pic naruto lol although symbol nazi party believe were used far earlier nothing do ideals could wrong but think still common place some cultures correct used various cultures usually meaning good fortune until nazis used now most folks only remember bad imagery similarly pentacles were good until flipped vertically now only seen demonic omg want last pic naruto poster put wall its too funny didnt know who might actually think scary which just makes funnier lol swastika symbol traditionally meant peace hinduism buddhism entire world hitler hijacked used way not intentionally meant bbc documentary youtube dicussing believe pic 2nd episode naruto think not gonna lie would totally want guy sensei jonin leader can feel youth here guy your leader youd never get bored thats sure lee nejiwhatdoesyourbyakugansayabouthispowerofyouth neji itsover9000 lols xd youd probably feel like went through navy seal training every day too more like whole weeks navy seal training everyday see what doing now everyone going watch first series now dammit happens exact same naruto original episode im calling shenanigans what would an easier way fill time than same episode played again after all will show different perspective though actually final episode naruto shippuuden series now entering loop where next week episode original naruto series will continue infinitely look preview its fresh new animation old one can tell because characters look more shippuden stylised sasukes hair shorter all three faces long thin rather than childish looking kakashi awesome darkness his heart but knows do something about oh goodness mine too hots him since first started middle school im now college let sad fact sink xd did anyone else see kakashi blush 2015 give thumbs up did did learn good lesson but not one kakashi wanted lol thats throw back narutos wind style training lol can see kakashis beloved comedic side emerging this comment removed haha thought made naruto retake photo guess not xd those pictures were taken ep right after became genin before meeting kakashi ep 34 ish naruto another picture made later must taken place right after graduated no naruto did not get another made show another ep lady tsunade andor shizune looking narutos application pic saying should get re done something thou do not know ep thou probably homage moment saw kakashi blush kids said very graceful greatful awwww being under guys guidance looks like so much fun basically adoptive dad lol naruto picture flashback fillers all kakashi point view restart aaagggghhh child sasuke wakes up itachi thats why dont touch pudding sasuke eyes go back normal smiles its very deep episode get character development kakashi his father committed suicide what drove him darkness then lost two teammatesits got worse all makes sense why 3rd hokage wanted sasuke naruto under him actually during chuunin exams sasuke gaara fought kakashi told gai personally asked 3rd hokage train sasuke but train him personally chuunin exam after team formed yeah remember felt suited since only leaf nin left sharingan 3rd kakashi both wanted sasuke all seem forget sasuke wanted by everyone beginning like his first kiss naruto kakashi fucking awesome those students deserved fail especially those pricks who were trying attack each other oo wouldve gotten an a+ hidden mist suppose already know punchline next episode but would interesting see kakashi transitions being coldhearted being mentor never really do get original naruto run only one more filler who complain about kakashi arc likely never suffer indignity waiting whole week see those kids chase lost dog woods mission following week being clip show honest want see more itachis life shisui also life first second hokage shisui died pretty young tbh dont think would much show first second possibly others well lets not make spinoff series every character naruto shall oh first hokage second hmm will get plenty origin story madaras origin story leaf first formed later real interesting arc manga cant wait see while true wouldve liked see more tobiramas story danzo tried kill 3rd hokage anything hes worse than uchiha why didnt go extinct rest understand its technically filler but long nothing contradicts canon think kishi would probably give same status cannonthink another pov expansion kakashis character do realize all shown episode happened right not filler all all talked about discussed referenced numerous times get right son uh yeah those things may not canon but fit right his style also not all bs did give itachi ultimatum killing off uchiha save sasuke even his ties orochimaru were real sir unlocked crunchy roll achievementfirst viewer think danzo done nothing wrong congratulations lol danzos crazy took out clan so could put all sharingans into his arm these new episodes great showing students growth teachers perspective hereeee weeee gooooo like new intro finally some hinata naruto can really dumb most time xd so naruto both imo needs just choose hinata already but hes still after sakura even after bs pulled going after sasuke see ever since sakura tried cozy up him land iron hasnt acted inlove her shes still important him but saw painful truth time; would only eyes sasuke hinata couldve really cool character her entire screentime didnt consist her swooning every sighting naruto her one cool moment 1v1ing pain save naruto but never talked her about think naruto probably blocked event out because struck nerve him doesnt wanna lose again lol narutos picture made laugh id forgotten about pic lol wow its almost like were right back where started actually wouldnt mind kept going zabuza arc its still favorite lets not get carried away would like see zabuza arc through kakashis eyes but love god dont do now make side series something but need get back what going naruto madara all madara who naruto restart but through kakashis eyes lol naruto restart but without filler well paced ie without dragging scenes out sake dragging things out
