I wonder if Lee is wearing his training weights?
Agreed I haven't watched this for 4-5 weeks..

I believe he has the training weights on. At the end of the episode, in the preview for next episode it shows him dropping them before fighting the sand taijutsu guy.
the ultimate
i knew.. even it's a filler.. but I still like to see all the new scenes....
The fillerception is strong in this one.
Yo dawg I heard you like fillers, so I put a filler in a filler in a filler. And I also heard you like guest passes: Y7E8ZW55ZQR
Filler-ception O.O

Fillers make you lose all that tension and energy built up.


Anyone else see krillin? lol
WHEN THEY WILL ABLE TO CONTINUE FIGHT MADARA
I'm seeing it in 4 days! All set, hopefully they still have movie posters.
I'm seeing it in two days!
Hell yeah! I'm going to watch it locally on March 4th here. Can't wait!
U guys do realize if u havent finished the manga then the movie will spoil a rediculous amount of stuff?
I already seen the movie

It made sense to me that they were weak. From the dialogue, you can tell sand team aren't taijutsu specialist while Team Gai is taijutsu specialist team. In a battle of taijutsu, well..yeah. Besides, Neji is freakin Jounin level already.
I was wondering about that. The waterfall guys r keeping their jonin level a secret but y is he allowed in?
@Shifisu You said you wanted it more realistic in the first comment, but in the second you point out how its not real life and they can make it however they want. Contradictory much?
They're trying to show that violence isn't the answer to every conflict, and that the shinobi world is changing.
@Shifisu Just because the desert is more dangerous doesn't mean its the same type of dangers as the forest. Desert heat is more likely to be the most dangerous thing.
I respect these Taijutsu users way more than most shinobi in this show.
Yo dawg, I heard you liked Lee's story so let me copy paste it in another village dawg!
Impending battle of the taijutsu nerds?
Taijutsu nerds? Sorry, but I sincerely believe they are above that. There's taijutsu noob, taijutsu user, taijutsu master/nerd, and finally, there's rock lee. They are both Lee. lol
DID SOMEONE SAY GUEST PASSES? DA49Z8YHJGV 5FQVFFN3ZVA NEXHC8MDUA5 KMZECAETSAZ t me later.
Thanks! I got 5FQVFFN3ZVA
Thanks!!
this might be filler but atleast it is good filler that explains how they all became chunin and how gaara became kazekage soo easily
Yeah... But then again, why??? The manga ended already and the transition to filler was horrible, we (who don't read manga) don't know WTF happened to Naruto and Sasuke =(
My guess is that they have a certain quota of episodes they have to meet, and just adapting the manga won't allow them to reach it.
U mean the company has a certain number of eps to reach. Its all about the money, dont kill the cash cow till shes dry.
Hopefully the lack of budget in this episode is made up for the next one.

SMKC37496DB XMG6U4UFAUF HVW3456J5HN Here are some important things that happened.
Took HVW345... you wonderful person!
I wonder just how old that "loli" is supposed to be...
Those following the main story know what happens to the Jinchuriki(sp?) character by the time of the 4th Ninja war. I wonder if we'll see Shira when we switch back?
Hey!
you won't. shira is a filler character to a finished product. he doesn't exist.
The anime staff has added filler characters into canon stories before. Shira might show up in the background somewhere.
fillertastic...
nice, thats the whole show in one word.
A filler battle inside a filler arch next week and the week after a filler flashback inside a filler battle inside a filler arch. Then Rock Lee gets an 11 tailed beast and rules the world with the ultimate tensugami inside a dream.
Perfect, r u a naruto writer? lol
