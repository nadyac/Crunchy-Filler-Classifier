Nice of Treebeard to help her out... must've mistaken her for a Hobbit
He is an ass. He should just leave. Acting like a boss when he isn't the one with blue flames. Now Rin is a Badass.
I don't see how people are bothered by a simple 'lol', that's just childish, I feel like I'm the only one mature enough to ignore it. Poor old LienaShizuku isn't majorly spamming whatsoever... _._
@Hurlak I understand I actually gave it a thumbs up cuz it is funny!
I am Groo... I mean, NEE!!
LOL marshall092
Guess what? The owner of this anime channel said that if enough new chapters can be made, they will make a second series! YAAAY! I love Blue Exorcist, it awesome.
have you tried looking for it online? there are some free sites to view or download it
@kurushikumu @Dan_Nguyen Well guys, it's been two years...
Lmaoo !! @Hurlak
Sorta like the 4 year gap between one of the seasons of slayers.
didn't JoJo's bizarre adventure go through something similar?
just what else does she keep in those boobs?
[This comment has been removed]
aren't we all just dying to find out?
You can just read it online on Ten Manga, I think that right now they have 47? I don't remember. I read Attack on Titan on some manga sight.

I think the real question is, what DOESN'T she keep in those boobs??
im getting attached to that little green thing
Nee! :)
its nee, hes AWSOME
He is a true knight that says Nee!
Neeeeeeeeee! =D
So okay, not only will I take that garden, but I'll have a buttload of those adorabe little Nees to go with it!
When you look closely at the baby little nee things, they look so cute, <3 Shiemi was amazing in this episode, and Rin was just as good (:
i love it when rin turns into his demon form ^ ^
I want him to beat the shit out of ME <3
^^^ Are you a masochist? o.O
^ Kagerou Shoukiin might have something to say about that.
^ I totally got that reference. Inu X Boku SS
Same here! It's almost like "BAN-KAI!" XD
Sheimi was really cool in this episode, she brings a good balance to Rin.
Too bad she is only a supporting character =P
What does it matter that she's a supporting character? Secondary characters are just as important to the story as the protagonist is, you know.
^true
I find it just hilarious how all the guards are pointing their guns at Rin without shooting while he is attacking the blond guy XD

I'm rather impressed with the level of thought put into these divergent episodes.
the girl had a "I see no point in living, if I can't be beautiful" moment haha
this show makes me feel better about the world
The ending song makes me want to do the robot XD
"Yeah, Bite Me, Dammit!" That line just made my day. I swear this gets better and better by the episode. I hope this show gets dubbed. It would probably get more views than bleach and naruto.
i prefer subbed
I'd rather not read subtitles....although I'll take those over bad VAs.
The dub is just as good in my opinion
I like either subs or dubs but I cant focus on the show with the subtitles. Its kind of exhausting
I don't think it'll get as many views as Naruto


Gotta admit...the OP and ED songs for this series are the best I've heard in a LONG time!
NEEEE! NEEE! NEEE!
We are the KNIGHTS who say... NEE!!
Best anime on right now.
GOTSTA love Blue Exorcist! <3
she is a cutie, the wife
Dat pic O.O
that president "Angel" really needs a beat down, very very VERY annoying guy
