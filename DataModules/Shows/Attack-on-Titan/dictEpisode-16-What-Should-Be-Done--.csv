basement haunts dreams fear will never learn what lies inside maybe 850 years first time titans appeared then were gone almost lost memory now back agree people turned into titans pixis told eren idea an enemy possibly forcing humans come together its most obvious origins titans just lose mind like eren tries not do really just expect everyone die no questions answered honest thats what would do thats what expect author do will all die inside because think jeans dedication his fallen friend shows just much changed his self beginning respect this comment removed this comment removed seriously dont understand why anyone would dislike jean dude literally most amazingly honest these characters just needed someone like marco show what capable give him push right direction get so many feels jean like first minutes mikasa did touch weird places thats exactly what heard lol eren well girl glasses tried successfully kill flies yes those guys arguing about mikasa loves eren not im going say yes not only does show so much affection him already but did not care beginning jean complimented her her hair hanji performed experiments his titan am only one who thought mikasa cute questioning eren want girl can kill seconds time month comeswell ill send flowers not all moment soo kawaii though wanned her hug him still nice course mikasas always cute shes waifu can baby kill whenever wants xd agreed yes swatting fly away needs titan strengthat least according mikasa haha guys meant titans point view humans like flys flys point view humans like titans hope made sense lol so eat flies some do think attacked her because didnt want her come along huge fight about right before left mission seems like hulk but only titan power what show so far huge pink rage monsterrofl think correct its fight just basically looking her likwe pest so why swatted her already pissed being so overprotective any1 else here thinking next episode gonna epic cant wait see new titan mikasa gonna open can whoop ass not quite could use hook onto titans launch themselves into air way t3nga salute just your picture alright 3rd time watching series all want know now im not emotionally overwhelmed by mission why didnt leave night titans shut down night right why start mission during day other words mikasa wants say illmakehimpayforbeatingupbyfuturehusband sayris may not way since initially transformed while being digested but well see because refuse spoil awesome animation style by reading manga hate say but dont think mikasa can take levi maybe not yet least time will tell thats not really casethe translations manga read different translators could different opinions make more like knows eren would love lose his overprotective bodyguard but doesnt care so true jean heyereniheardwhenyouturnedintoatitanyoutriedtokillmikasawhatdoesthatmean mikasa noerenwastryingtohitafly lol mikasa not even together yet already having cover up domestic violence xd please dont do again almost died laughing ban making funny comments want live rofl sir win thread better serious macerate said well anyone needs ill refreshing page endlessly until episode 17 starts playing only made episode come out faster ikr am seriously guessing party responsible sabotage last episode either mps wallists wallists simply zealous behavior but mps means were trying hide something garrison cus unless access wall dont know else couldve transformed into titan outside walls unless came outside wall somehow maybe colossal titan like eren because seemed somewhat intelligent only destroyed wall didnt eat anyone wouldnt hilarious colossal titan popped soon left gate know its going happen though xd love focused other characters more than eren episode definitely refreshing seeing things perspective too sure hinted her feelings towards him quite bit thing eren doesnt seem react much does fanfic ammo acquired fire will anim3fre4k nooooo plot bunnies invading evasive maneuvers worst part week realizing need wait week next episode survey corps ceremony so intense just what commander planning where brave enough stay after then wont run away things go bad witch means can depend needs its better 10 people will able depend than 100 people will run away things get rough exactly right 100 will run will not only get themselves killed but many others well chaos10 courage follow orders will worst get only themselves killed might survive save more since think ones who killed bean sonny trainees think commander trying give vital information bait spies then scare nonspies away way reduces number people watch thisisatruesalute lol know what mean ive watched three times music goes perfect scene favorite song off ost too some biblical story gideon came mind actually thats what series makes think but especially scene props jean episode jean gained ton respect books episode correction known titans dont reproductive organs however these newly discoveredcreated titans so who
