the manga is awesome
Agreed. The manga is excellent and I'm always looking forward to the new chapters
I should really read the manga. I can't get enough of the anime

Personally, I don't mind it when an anime adaptation doesn't include everything from its source material (Manga/Game/etc), as it leaves more suspense. Especially when an anime reaches its peak while the manga continues.
let the adventure begin
Ok i just finished watching the whole season and this trailer doesn't do it justice
watching the trailer after finishing this amazing series gives me such a nice feeling idk
You should read the manga; it's waaaaaaay more extense. The anime cut a lot of things.

I'm Christian and I could care less. It's just an anime, it's not like I'm going to stop worshipping God because of it.
It's not that. Satan is just an uncomfortable topic. Obviously this anime has no real connection to Satan, but it's a sensitive issue. It's like having Hitler have a major role in an anime, it's just uncomfortable. That's their view.
Well, yeah, but Hitler was a person who DID exist. I don't know if satan existed or not, but I just see him as a character in the Bible (I'm catholic).
Everytime I hear "A-ni-Plex" I'm gonna think of Gurren Lagann. ;.;
